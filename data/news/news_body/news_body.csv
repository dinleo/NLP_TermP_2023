2022-01-03,"The Federal Reserve in a little over two months is expected to enact its first rate increase in three years.As officials prep for a return to more conventional monetary policy, Wall Street is watching closely.The Fed is responding to inflation pressures that are running — by some measures — at the fastest rate in nearly 40 years. If everything goes according to plan, the Federal Reserve in a little over two months will enact its first rate increase in three years, a move policymakers deem necessary and that markets and the economy are grudgingly coming to accept.The Fed last raised rates in late 2018, part of a ""normalization"" process that happened in the waning period of the longest-lasting economic expansion in U.S. history.related investing newsThe Fed could enact a 'substitute' interest rate hike at its June meetingJeff Cox15 hours agoJust seven months later, the central bank retreated as the expansion looked increasingly fragile. Eight months after that initial cut in July 2019, the Fed was forced to roll back its benchmark borrowing rate all the way to zero as the nation confronted a pandemic that threw the global economy into a sudden and shocking tailspin. So as officials prep for a return to more conventional monetary policy, Wall Street is watching closely. The first trading day of the new year indicated the market is willing to keep pushing higher, in the midst of the gyrations that have greeted the Fed since it indicated a policy pivot a month ago.""When you look back historically on the Fed, it's usually multiple tightenings before you get in trouble with the economy and the markets,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.Paulsen expects the market to take the initial hike – likely to be enacted at the March 15-16 meeting – without too much fanfare, as it's been well telegraphed and will still only bring the benchmark overnight rate up to a range of 0.25%-0.5%.""We've developed this attitude on the Fed based on the last couple decades where the economy was growing at 2% per annum,"" Paulsen said. ""In a 2% stall-speed economy world, if the Fed even thinks about tightening it's damaging. But we don't live in that world anymore.""Fed officials at their December meeting penciled in two additional 25-basis-point hikes before the end of the year. A basis point is equal to one one-hundredth of 1 percentage point.Current pricing in the fed funds futures market points to about a 60% likelihood of a hike in March, and a 61% probability that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will add two more by the end of 2022, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool.Those subsequent hikes are where the Fed could see some blowback.The Fed is hiking rates in response to inflation pressures that are running by some measures at the fastest rate in nearly 40 years. Chairman Jerome Powell and most other policymakers spent much of 2021 insisting that prices would ease soon, but conceded toward the end of the year that the trend was no longer ""transitory."" Whether the Fed can orchestrate an ""orderly coming down"" will determine how markets react to the rate hikes, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and chair of Gramercy Fund Management.In that scenario, ""the Fed gets it just right and demand eases a little bit and the supply side responds. That is sort of the Goldilocks adjustment,"" he said Monday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" However, he said the danger is that inflation persists and rises even more than the Fed anticipates, prompting a more aggressive response.""The pain is already there, so they are having to play massive catch-up, and the question is at what point do they lose their nerve,"" El-Erian added.Market veterans are watching bond yields, which are expected to indicate advanced clues about the Fed's intentions. Yields have stayed largely in check despite expectations for rate hikes, but Paulsen said he expects to see a reaction that ultimately could take the benchmark 10-year Treasury to around 2% this year.At the same time, El-Erian said he expects the economy to do fairly well in 2022 even if the market hits some headwinds. Likewise, Paulsen said the economy is strong enough to withstand rate hikes, which will boost borrowing rates across a wide swath of consumer products. However, he said he figures a correction will come in the second half of the year as rate increases continue.But Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said she thinks market turbulence would be more pronounced even as the economy grows.Markets are coming off a prolonged period of ""a long decline in real interest rates, which allowed stocks to break free from economic fundamentals and their price/earnings multiples to expand,"" Shalett said in a report for clients.""Now, the period of declining fed funds rates which began in early 2019 is ending, which should allow real rates to rise from historic negative lows. This shift is likely to unleash volatility and prompt changes in market leadership,"" she added.Investors will get a closer look at the Fed's thinking later this week, when minutes of the December FOMC meeting are released Wednesday. Of particular interest for the market will be discussions not only about the pace of rate hikes and the decision to taper asset purchases, but also when the central bank will start reducing its balance sheet.Even as the Fed intends to halt the purchases in the spring, it will continue to reinvest the proceeds of its current holdings, which will maintain the balance sheet around its current $8.8 trillion level.Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst expects balance sheet reduction to start in the first quarter of 2023."
2022-01-03,"Germany has just turned the page on Angela Merkel's 16 years of leadership.France is bracing itself for an uncertain presidential election in the spring.And Italy is anxiously waiting to find out whether Mario Draghi will leave the prime ministerial post. The balance of power is changing in the European Union's three largest economies which could have significant implications for financial markets.Germany has just turned the page on Angela Merkel's 16 years of leadership, France is bracing itself for an uncertain presidential election in the spring, and Italy is anxiously waiting to find out whether Mario Draghi will leave his prime ministerial post.""We may well be in for a rather profound 'watershed moment,' with significant positive implications for policies,"" Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, said in a note to clients in December. ""The new German government will bring in significant reforms in Germany, if less headline-grabbing and straightforward then desirable, and it will, very likely, also facilitate reforms in Europe,"" Nielsen said.The newly established government has promised to decarbonize the German economy and to invest in digitalization. At the same time, its idea is also to follow a sound fiscal policy from 2023 onward, once stimulus to deal with the pandemic has been faded out.These targets are likely to influence European discussions on how to update the fiscal rulebook — a topic that market players are following closely. The euro zone has had strict deficit and debt targets, but there has been a lack of enforcement of these rules. In addition, others question whether these targets are still valid in a post-pandemic world. How much governments will spend, and where, could have direct implications for the bond market. ""Previous government stimulus plus the new government's impressive investment policies will unfold in 2022 and lead to stellar growth performance,"" analysts at ING said in a note in December.The German economy grew 2% in the second quarter of 2021 and 1.7% in the third quarter, according to the national statistics office. In the whole of 2020, GDP dropped by almost 5%.These numbers have been significantly impacted by the pandemic and supply chain issues.""As soon as global supply chain frictions start to abate and the fourth wave of the pandemic is behind us, industrial production will strongly rebound, private consumption will start to pick up and investments will flourish and the German economy should stage an impressive comeback as European growth champion 2022,"" he added.In October, the International Monetary Fund projected a GDP growth rate of 4.6% for Germany in 2022 — this was higher than the estimates for France and Italy. French voters are heading to the polls in late April. Incumbent President Emmanuel Macron has not yet announced his intention to run for a second mandate. However, he is currently polling first among all candidates.But there is plenty of time for voter polls to change, even more so as new candidates formalize their plans for the presidency.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration candidate, is seen as a threat to the likeminded politician Marine Le Pen. Meanwhile, the arrival of Valerie Pecresse to lead her center-right conservative campaign is also seen as a challenge to Macron, if he decides to run for a second term.Nielsen described Pecresse as a ""serious contender against the favorite, still undeclared, Macron,"" if she makes it to the second round of the election. At the moment, she is polling fourth, after Macron and the two far-right candidates. ""Macron will therefore have to navigate an even narrower path to reform France, notably concerning pensions, the public service and the labor market,"" analysts at ING said.Nonetheless, a Macron victory would mean that France would still have a pro-European leader looking to work with Germany and Italy to reform the region. In Italy and abroad, everybody wants to know if Mario Draghi will remain as the country's prime minister —or if he will choose to be the next president instead. The latter would bring a fresh wave of political uncertainty given the fragmentation of the Italian Parliament.""The bottom line is that the political equilibrium that has prevailed since Draghi's appointment as PM is set to be shaken, if not broken, by the upcoming presidential vote,"" Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of the consultancy firm Teneo, said in a note in December.As president, Draghi would have less direct influence on Italian politics. ""Draghi would struggle to act on behalf of Italy vis-a-vis the EU from the presidential palace,"" Piccoli said.However, Italy would still have a pro-European president who would have a say in some of the measures that a new government may take.If Draghi remains prime minister, his work ""could be more complicated in the months ahead, depending on how the ruling coalition manages the presidential election process,"" Piccoli noted.Draghi is the head of a technocratic government, supported by the various political groups in the Italian Parliament. Without their votes, Draghi's work could face obstacles when presenting new laws.Nonetheless, ""in this scenario, Draghi would almost certainly remain prime minister until elections in 2023, thereby securing Italy an unprecedented influence on key European policies next year while, possibly, leaving Italian politics somewhat less anchored over the longer term,"" Nielsen added."
2022-01-04,"ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., January 4, 2022 — More than half of voters disapprove President Joe Biden's handling of economic issues in the first year of his administration, according to a CNBC and Change Research poll conducted December 17-20, 2021.CNBC and Change Research polled more than 1,800 registered voters to determine current economic sentiment and whether voters are better off than they were a year ago as the Biden presidency approaches its one-year mark. More than half (56%) of voters disapprove of the job President Biden is doing as president and are giving him a ""C"" or ""D"" in all areas on his report card, virtually the same as Donald Trump's lowest ratings in 2020 CNBC and Change Research polling.The survey highlights top national issues including how Biden is handling the economy, jobs, the coronavirus and more. Similar to previous polling results, Republicans continue to express more disapproval than Democrats about Biden's performance. However, in this recent poll, Biden is also losing confidence from Independents and some Democrats.  The poll shows that the economy is the top priority for nearly all parties and demographics and 73% of voters say the U.S. economy is in ""poor"" or ""not so good shape,"" up 17 points from a year ago. A 60% majority disapprove of the way President Biden is handling the economy, a 6-point decline in approval since the CNBC and Change Research poll in late August, and voters give Biden a ""C"" grade on his handling of the economy. Voters also disapprove of Biden's handling of kitchen table issues like the price of everyday goods (72% disapprove). Inflation is of particular concern; 84% of voters say that the price of groceries is higher, compared to a year ago, and more than one-third (38%) of voters blame rising prices on President Biden, followed by the global pandemic (26%), corporations (23%) and 11% of voters blame government spending. As a result, American voters are increasingly pessimistic about the economy improving in the next year.Another noteworthy subject in Biden's report card is jobs with voters giving the president a ""C."" Even though there has been a 9-point improvement in perceptions of the U.S. job market in the past year, the majority of voters (56%) say Biden should receive little to no credit for the economy adding 6 million jobs since he took office. As the Great Resignation continues, 13% of voters say they are very or somewhat likely to quit their jobs in the next six months and when asked what is most important when looking for a new job, the primary factor voters say is higher pay (64%), followed by better benefits (38%) and improved work-life balance (20%). Additionally, of the voters who say they are likely to leave their jobs in the next six months, 18% point to avoiding a vaccine mandate as a factor. When it comes to COVID precautions as a way to help the economy grow and create jobs, a 53% majority of voters believe that expanding vaccine requirements will not help the economy and create jobs while 36% of voters believe that it will and 11% of voters are unsure.Additional key findings from the CNBC and Change Research ""The Biden Economy"" poll conducted December 17-20, 2021 include:Keeping taxes on corporations low is the policy proposal voters are the least likely to believe will grow the economy and create jobs; a 58% majority of voters say it will not grow the economy and create jobs and just 29% believe that it will.Biden gets little mileage out of his legislative accomplishments. Only 21% of voters say the American Rescue Plan helped them, 29% say it left them worse off and 50% say it did not make a difference. While 43% of Biden voters say the plan left them personally better off, 56% of Trump voters say it left them worse off. Though 55% of voters give Biden credit for passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, just 44% of voters say it will grow the economy and create jobs, including 84% of Biden voters, and 38% say it will not help, including 73% of Trump voters.Regarding inflation, the most frequently cited expenses by voters are groceries and gas, followed by ""everything"" and healthcare costs. Also, 53% believe that the higher prices recently seen in stores will not come down for a long time and 25% say they will never come back down. Even a 56% majority of Democrats believe that they will not come down for a long time or ever.A majority of voters (55%) disapprove of how Biden is handling the coronavirus, grading him a ""C"" in the report card. However, there is a clear division in sentiment among the parties; Biden voters gave the president a ""B"" while Trump voters gave him a ""F."" When asked whether the coronavirus will be better, worse or about the same in a year from now, 34% of voters say it will be better, 35% say it will be the same and 31% say it will be worse. The poll also shows that 50% of voters say the Biden administration has gone too far with vaccine mandates and 25% say not far enough.Only 37% of voters give Biden credit for the stock market reaching record highs, and negative impressions of the stock market are 23 points higher today than they were a year ago despite these gains.CNBC Senior White House Correspondent Kayla Tausche will reveal the results of the CNBC and Change Research ""The Biden Economy"" poll today, Tuesday, January 4th throughout CNBC's Business Day programming. For more information on the survey including the full results and methodology and in-depth articles, go to: https://changeresearch.com/post/cnbc-change-research-national-poll-biden-year-1-economic-report-card/.Methodology:Change Research surveyed 1,895 registered voters nationally from December 17-20, 2021. Ads placed on social media targeted all adults living in the US and those who indicated that they were not registered to vote were terminated. As the survey fielded, Change Research used dynamic online sampling: adjusting ad budgets, lowering budgets for ads targeting groups that were overrepresented and raising budgets for ads targeting groups that were underrepresented, so that the final sample was roughly representative of the population across different groups. Post-stratification was performed on region, age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, 2018 vote and 2020 presidential vote. Weighting parameters were based on the demographic compositions of the November 2020 electorate, obtained from the voter file. That is, if a given age bracket or gender group represented x% of the 2020 electorate on the voter file, then that same group of 2020 voters would be weighted to x% in this survey. Presidential results were obtained from precinct data. The margin of error as traditionally calculated is 2.3% and the modeled margin of error for this survey is 3.1%, which uses effective sample sizes that adjust for the design effect of weighting. This research, like all public opinion research, does entail some additional unmeasured error.For additional methodological information, visit: https://www.changeresearch.com/methodology-and-accuracy.For more information contact:CNBCJennifer Dauble201-735-4721jennifer.dauble@nbcuni.comCNBCStephanie Hirlemann201-397-2838steph.hirlemann@nbcuni.comChange Researchpress@changeresearch.comAbout CNBC:CNBC is the recognized world leader in business news, providing real-time financial market coverage, business content and general news consumed by more than 557 million people per month across all platforms.

2022-01-04,"President Joe Biden's overall disapproval rating reached a new high in December as more voters signaled their unhappiness with his handling of the economy and the Covid pandemic.Results from a CNBC/Change Research poll show 60% of respondents said they disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy as he nears the conclusion of his first year in office.A 55% majority of survey respondents also signaled disapproval of his leadership during the pandemic, an area in which he previously excelled. President Joe Biden's disapproval rating hit a new high in December as more voters signaled their unhappiness with his administration's supervision of the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic.Fifty-six percent of voters now say they disapprove of the job Biden is doing, the worst such reading of his presidency as he approaches the end of his first year in office, according to new CNBC/Change Research poll. Prior polls in the series showed Biden's disapproval rating at 54% in early September and 49% in April.Biden's approval rating is now at 44%, down from 46% in September and 51% in April.The latest sign of trouble for Biden comes as his administration looks to tackle a wide range of economic and political problems ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, which will decide the balance of power in Congress.The White House is scrambling to quell fears about price acceleration and inflation, resurrect the president's Build Back Better climate-and-family legislation, and rejuvenate the country's public health response as the omicron variant drives a new spike in Covid cases.Frustrations over the economy are the main culprit behind Biden's flagging popularity as nearly every demographic declared it their No. 1 issue.The economy was the top priority for men and women, every age cohort, Latino and white voters, and those with and without college educations. Black respondents, who named racism their chief priority, said the economy takes second place.Sixty percent of the survey's 1,895 respondents said they disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy, marking a six-point decline in approval from September.On personal economic issues, voters are even more likely to criticize the president. Some 72% disapprove of his handling of the price of everyday goods, while 66% disapprove of his efforts to help their wallets. Biden also scored poorly on issues voters are otherwise likely to say are going well.For example, most people who said they plan to vote in the 2022 midterms say the U.S. stock market is doing ""excellent"" or ""good"" while just 46% say it's doing ""not so good"" or ""poor.""But when asked whether they approve or disapprove of Biden's handling of the market, just 44% said they strongly or somewhat approve compared to 56% who somewhat or strongly disapprove.In fact, a greater percentage of respondents said they feel the U.S. stock market is doing worse than the year-earlier period than those who said it's doing better.Those opinions, gathered from Dec. 17 to 20, run counter to what was one of the market's best years in decades. All three major U.S. equity indexes posted mammoth double-digit gains in 2021 compared to their historical annual average around 7% or 8%.The S&P 500 finished the year up 26.89% and posted a record close at least once a month. The broad market index notched 70 such record closes in 2021, the second-highest annual total behind 1995's 77 closing highs.All 11 sectors finished 2021 higher, with energy and real estate posting the best returns. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 18.73% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 21.4%.Biden's inability to garner credit for one of the stock market's best years in living memory is symptomatic of a larger problem for Democrats in 2022: The party can't seem to convince voters that things are better than they were 12 months ago.   CNBC PoliticsRead more of CNBC's politics coverage:Republicans walk out of debt ceiling talks, say White House isn't being 'reasonable'GOP Sen.

Tim Scott of South Carolina files paperwork to run for presidentG-7 leaders commit to more Russia sanctions with Ukraine's Zelenskyy set to attend summit The unemployment rate is down to 4.2% from 6.3%, average hourly earnings are up 4.8%, and 243 million people (or 73% of the U.S. population) have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine compared to the 6 million who had received one by early January 2021.This failure to turn improving economic stats into popular support adds pressure for any Democrat facing a challenge from the Republicans in the midterms, which will decide whether the Democrats keep their razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate.While the president's party typically loses seats in Congress during a first-term election, present polling about Biden and Democrats suggest they could face a rout in November.That may be because members of both parties are growing more frustrated with inflation.Some 84% of those surveyed said the prices they see for everyday goods are higher than they were a year ago, while just 19% report earning more income over the same period. And only 23% say they believe inflation is starting to come down or will begin to decline soon.Respondents tend to blame Biden (38%) for the price increases versus the global pandemic (26%) or corporations (23%). For their part, Democrats say the global pandemic caused the current rash of inflation and that it will calm down once supply chain disruptions are resolved. But voters' discontent is starting to spread outside the economic arena.Asked to give the Biden administration a letter grade on both how it's handled health-care costs and raising wages, Democrats gave the president two Cs, but a B on the economy overall.Independents gave Biden a D on every issue, while Republicans gave the president a failing grade across the board minus the stock market, where they gave him a D.What's more, a 55% majority of survey respondents said they disapprove of the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, a sign Biden is struggling in an area where he previously excelled.A separate survey conducted by CNBC in December showed only 46% approve of his job on the virus versus 48% who disapprove. That April version of that survey showed that 62% of surveyed Americans approved of Biden's handling of the pandemic.Change Research noted that the president's worsening approval ratings on Covid is likely due to an increase in voters who believe the White House hasn't gone far enough when it comes to vaccine mandates.When it comes to how the Biden administration is handling the virus, 50% of respondents say the White House has gone too far, 24% say it hasn't gone far enough and 26% believe it's done a good job.Biden's dip in Covid-related approval figures comes as the number of new coronavirus cases soar across the country and tests the president's campaign commitment to do a better job at managing the disease."
2022-01-04,"The IMF expects the U.S. economy to grow by 5.2% in 2022, while the global economy is seen expanding by 4.9%.In Aug. 2018, Apple became the first publicly-traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion valuation and its market cap has tripled in less than four years.Microsoft is valued at $2.5 trillion, while Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet are valued at $1.75 trillion. Apple's market cap will continue to rise beyond the $3 trillion milestone it hit briefly Monday, according to one chief investment officer, who argued that the stock's valuation is justified.Patrick Armstrong, CIO at investment management firm Plurimi Group, expects Apple's share price to continue to grow quicker than the overall economy. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to grow by 5.2% in 2022, while the global economy is seen expanding by 4.9%.""I don't think it's going to be a stock that's going to double very quickly,"" Armstrong told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" Tuesday, but he added that it will ""grow faster than the economy.""In Aug. 2018, Apple became the first publicly-traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion valuation and its market cap has tripled in less than four years.""Apple is an incredibly positive company in terms of cash flow generation, earnings, market share, profit margins. It's almost ideal when you look at all of those metrics,"" Armstrong said. Microsoft is valued at $2.5 trillion, while Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet are valued at $1.75 trillion. Some analysts have questioned whether Apple is overvalued but Armstrong said the iPhone maker's market cap isn't as ""lofty"" as some other companies.""It's an incredible company trading at a premium multiple,"" he said. ""I don't think there's anything outlandish about that. I think great companies should trade at premium multiples. I don't think you're in the extreme lofty multiples that some of the other companies are.""Armstrong said he sold Apple shares last February before buying more during a dip in December. Not everyone is as bullish on Apple right now, however.Emma Wall, head of investment analysis and research at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday that now probably isn't the time for investors to buying Apple or Tesla shares.""If you already have exposures to them, taking some gains, but keeping those exposures in a diversified portfolio, is no bad thing,"" she added.Correction: This story misstated the market caps of Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet. The two companies have a valuation of $1.72 trillion and $1.94 trillion, respectively."
2022-01-05,"The omicron variant has prompted Covid-19 cases to surge to record levels.Yet previous forms of government aid, namely expanded unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, have expired.This time around, any financial aid authorized by lawmakers could look different. The reason: The pandemic has changed, and so has the U.S. economy.  Omicron is wreaking more disruption on the American economy.That could prompt Washington lawmakers to revisit relief strategies from earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic.Conversations on Capitol Hill have turned to possible aid for small businesses, restaurants, gyms and performance venues that have been hardest hit by this new wave, said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. ""The conversation has not yet been extended to assistance to individuals,"" Mills said. ""But it has gone from something that is not going to happen to something we have to watch.""The U.S. reached a record single-day record of Covid cases this week, with more than 1 million new infections reported.More from Personal Finance:What pandemic aid remains available to familiesHave Covid? You can't get unemployment benefits Families who got the child tax credit should watch for this IRS letterYet some measures of federal relief to help individuals and families – namely expanded unemployment benefits and three sets of stimulus checks – are no longer in effect.This time around, lawmakers may not revisit those same strategies.The reason: The pandemic has changed, and so has the U.S. economy.While the early days of the pandemic was marked by high unemployment and record layoffs, that has now shifted in workers' favor.""With millions of job openings that are going unfilled, Congress is going to be hesitant to provide something that could be seen as being a disincentive to filling those positions,"" Mills said.That does not, however, mean no help is available.States and localities are still sitting on $90 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act that was passed last year, according to Dave Kamper, senior state policy coordinator at the Economic Policy Institute.They are slated to get $150 billion more later this spring. Schools received $120 billion, much of which may not have been spent, he added.""We're not going to fix this pandemic by that ARPA money sitting in a bank account,"" Kamper said. ""We're going to fix the pandemic by that ARPA money getting spent, and there's a ton of good ways to spend it.""One way states could help is by providing paid sick and family leave to workers now that federal measures have expired. While some states like New York do this, more could add these programs to help alleviate the burdens of the pandemic, Kamper said.Providing paid leave could help inspire more workers who are unable to take time off to get vaccinated, he said. States could also create one-time payments for residents – either as an incentive to get vaccinated or as paid time off to get the vaccine, he said.They could also move to bolster unemployment insurance, though large scale efforts would still need to be handled by the federal government, Kamper said.On Capitol Hill, more aid to individuals could already be in the works via the proposed extension of the expanded child tax credit.Eligible families received monthly payments of up to $300 per child in 2021. The last payments were deployed in December and will not continue unless Congress passes the Build Back Better Act.Democrats are hoping to pass that bill through a simple majority known as reconciliation. But those efforts have stalled. Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, has said he would like to see the extended credit have stricter targeting requirements.""The conversation about individuals really does start with what to do with the child tax credit,"" Mills said."
2022-01-05,"Rising interest rates are a potential headwind even as the economy expands.Here are some ways to prepare your portfolio for the changes ahead. Investors may be rattled heading into the new year, and rightfully so.Even as the omicron Covid variant drives a new wave of infections, the Federal Reserve's easy money policies are nearing an end.For months, a variety of inflation reports reached their highest levels in decades. The Consumer Price Index, which measures the cost of a wide-ranging basket of goods and services, surged 6.8% year over year, the fastest rate since June 1982.In response, the central bank signaled it will make aggressive policy moves with Fed officials seeing as many as three rate hikes this year, two more next year and another two in 2024.""The writing is on the wall that interest rates are poised to rise in 2022, but don't let that obscure the bigger picture, which is that the economy is expanding, unemployment is falling and corporate profits are expected to grow,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.More from Personal Finance:Here is the age when many Americans hope to retireHow to turn uncertainty into opportunity in 2022Here's where investors should put their money""People are terrified because they see interest rates are going to go up,"" added Daniel Milan, managing partner of Cornerstone Financial Services in Southfield, Michigan. ""But, from an investment standpoint, interest rates go up when the economy is typically going well.""""People are spending,"" he added. ""If you look at it from a different lens, this means some positive things are happening.""To take advantage of the current climate, Milan advises clients to make four key changes to their portfolios. Here are his top recommendations:Avoid longer-term fixed income assets: Generally, Treasury bonds lose value over time if the interest they earn is below the rate of inflation. Currently, the bellwether 10-year note is yielding about 1.62%. ""If you are going to have bonds in your portfolio, we recommend short-term bond funds until interest rates go up,"" Milan said. ""They are going to be less risky in a rising rate environment.""Although short-term bond funds are less sensitive to rate increases, they also provide less income earning potential.Still, they'll add some stability when equity markets get rocky, McBride said. ""Even if the market does well this year, it's likely to be a bumpy ride along the way.""It's during that bumpy ride, you'll be glad to have some money in bonds,"" he said.Find a floating rate: Bond funds that adjust for inflation are another way to mitigate risk.For investors who are looking to section off a portion of their portfolio — say, one to three years' worth of retirement income — into a less volatile investment that will keep pace with current inflation, a floating rate exchange-traded bond fund may be appropriate, said Katelyn Murray, a certified financial planner at Kendall Capital in Rockville, Maryland. ""These ETFs are conservative like a bond, trade like a stock and diversify like a mutual fund,"" she said.Milan recommends floating rate bond ETFs like the iShares Floating Rate or Market Vectors Investment Grade Floating Rate, which include investment-grade corporate bonds and are less exposed to interest-rate risk over time.However, ""you don't want to be overly conservative and miss out on the appreciation you can get in the equity market,"" Murray added. ""You need long-term growth, as well.""Seek out stocks with dividend growth: To that end, companies that are well poised to weather higher prices and have a track record of consistent dividend payouts are also good assets to own as interest rates rise.Milan recommends large-cap staples, like Home Depot, Lowe's and PepsiCo, for example, which have a history of increasing dividends year over year.""That is both a protection against inflation and offers a yield that bonds currently do not,"" he said.Focus on the financial sector. Financial stocks generally benefit from a strong economy and higher rates since banks can charge borrowers more, while still paying depositors less.""As rates go up, the financial sector performs pretty well,"" Milan said, particularly stocks such as PNC Financial Services or ETFs like First Trust, he added. (Experts say international stocks, utilities, health care, consumer staples and real estate investment trusts could also outperform the broader market in 2022.) ""Does that mean you radically change your approach? Not necessarily,"" said CFP Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York.""Financial services are generally attractive but there's danger in always saying this will happen,"" he cautioned.""If rising rates don't materialize in the way you thought, you may find yourself underperforming.""Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."
2022-01-05,"Omicron could inspire more people to buy goods rather than services, which would compound inflation as demand remains high and supply chain challenges continue, National Retail Federation's chief economist, Jack Kleinhenz, said.The latest Covid wave is unlikely to prompt an economic slowdown or a shutdown of businesses, however, the advisor to the retail trade group said.Some restaurants and retailers have had to shutter locations or reduce hours as they cope with short staffing due to Covid or step up sanitizing in coronavirus hotspots. The spread of the highly infectious omicron variant is likely to fuel more inflation, as Americans keep shopping instead of spending more outside of the home, according to the National Retail Federation's chief economist, Jack Kleinhenz.The major retail trade group's advisor said Wednesday in a news release, however, that he does not expect the latest wave of Covid cases to prompt an economic slowdown or a shutdown of businesses.""Little is certain about omicron's impact on consumer demand, but people who stay at home because of the variant are more likely to spend their money on retail goods rather than services like dining out or in-person entertainment,"" he said in the news release. ""That would put further pressure on inflation since supply chains are already overloaded across the globe.""Kleinhenz said that ""each successive variant has slowed down the economy but that the degree of slowdown has been less."" And, he added, consumers may have more confidence to spend because of being fully vaccinated or hearing about milder cases from the variant.Covid cases in the U.S. hit a pandemic record of more than 1 million new infections on Monday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The country is now reporting a seven-day average of more than 553,000 daily new infections, more than double the week prior, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins data through Tuesday.The spike in coronavirus cases has prompted retailers and restaurants including Starbucks, Apple, Nike and Gap-owned Athleta to shut stores or shorten hours, as they cope with short staffing or step up sanitizing. Walmart temporarily shut nearly 60 U.S. stores in coronavirus hotspots last month to sanitize them. Macy's said Tuesday that it is reducing store hours for the rest of the month.However, many of those same stores have made it easier for customers to shop in other ways — from home delivery to curbside pickup.

It predicted that sales in November and December would rise between 8.5% and 10.5% compared with a year ago and reach an all-time record total of between $843.4 billion and $859 billion of sales.Kleinhenz later boosted that forecast, saying in early December that holiday sales could rise by as much as 11.5% compared with the year-ago period.The trade group expects to report the official holiday sales total next week, after the Census Bureau shares December retail sales data."
2022-01-06,"Economists expect 422,000 jobs were added in December, double the pace in November, according to Dow Jones.The rapidly spreading Covid omicron variant did not impact hiring in December, but it is expected to show up as a drag in January, the report added.Across-the-board increases are expected, led by the leisure and hospitality industry. Hiring is expected to have been strong and broad-based in December, even as some companies were asking employees to work from home temporarily due to the rapid spread of the Covid omicron variant.Economists forecast 422,000 jobs were added in December, double the 210,000 in November, according to Dow Jones. The unemployment rate is expected to slip by a tenth of a percentage point to 4.1%.""It should be a better month than we saw in November, and the unemployment rate should move a bit lower,"" said Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen. ""The main message coming out of this is the economy should be one step loser to full employment, and one step closer to Fed tightening.""The Federal Reserve has forecast three quarter-point rate hikes for 2022, and Gapen said a strong jobs number in December would reinforce the central bank is on track to raise interest rates as soon as March.""The employment picture is more than good enough,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. ""We're still down 3.9 million jobs, yet the Fed has decided we're at full employment. We're likely to see an unemployment rate of 4.1%, which is below what the Fed considers full employment.""  Average hourly wages are expected to be up 0.4% in December, or 4.2% year-over-year, compared to a 4.8% gain in November, according to Dow Jones.The consumer price index in November was up 6.8%, the fastest pace since 1982. If prices and wages raise in tandem, the concern is there could be a self-feeding wage/price spiral.""The problem with the Fed is they're worried about the inflation we're seeing becoming entrenched,"" Swonk said. ""Already you have inflation outpacing wage gains. Even as inflation cools, will it be enough? Or are we going to see workers saying they're not even being compensated for inflation.""Rising wages are being driven in part by the same issues that are behind the increase in the cost of goods. There is strong demand, but not enough supply of either goods or people. Swonk said hiring should be up across the board in December, led by strong gains in the leisure and hospitality industry.Tom Gimbel, CEO of Chicago-based LaSalle Network, said his recruitment firm is busier than ever.""Anybody can get a job who wants one. We said that in the dot-com times, and it was nothing like this. And I don't think it's [only] for the next 18 months. Companies want to hire people,"" Gimbel said.In mid-December, companies extended stay-at-home work, and some employees were told to work at home for a few weeks, as in the case of Goldman Sachs. Apple delayed the return of its corporate staff to offices indefinitely.Swonk said the pandemic could definitely be a drag on job growth for January, with small businesses facing pressure of staying open because of sick staff. It could have a ripple effect on the economy and job market, she said.Indeed, the omicron factor could make for a flattish or even negative payrolls number in January, Swonk said.""The bottom line is if you are closing down a bunch of small businesses temporarily, a lot of those will show up as no payrolls in the week of the survey,"" she said. ""This is delta and omicron colliding with the flu season, and you're going to lose paychecks.""According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer workers worked from home in November. The number of people teleworking fell by 0.3 percentage point to 11.3%.Gimbel said he does not expect some workers to return to the workforce until after next summer, and that many of them are parents of small and school-age children. The quit rate also remains very high.""People who can afford to quit are quitting. We've never seen this type of labor shortage before,"" said Gimbel. ""This type of labor shortage is due to one thing and one thing only, and that's the pandemic."""
2022-01-06,"The prospect of a Fed triple threat of tightening sent the market into a tailspin on Wednesday.Central bankers indicated in their December minutes that they expect not only to raise rates and taper asset purchases soon — but also could be teeing up a balance sheet reduction.That's important for investors because central bank liquidity has helped underpin markets during the Covid tumult. Investors have been preparing for the Federal Reserve to start hiking interest rates. They also know the central bank is cutting the amount of bonds it buys each month. On top of that, they figured, eventually, the tapering would lead to a reduction in the nearly $9 trillion in assets the Fed is holding.What they didn't expect were all three things happening at the same time.But minutes from the Fed's December meeting, released Wednesday, indicated that may well be the case.The meeting summary showed members ready to not only start raising interest rates and tapering bond buying, but also being prepared to engage in a high-level conversations about reducing holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.While the moves are designed to fight inflation and as the jobs market heals, the jolt of a Fed triple threat of tightening sent the market into a tailspin Wednesday. The result saw stocks give back their Santa Claus rally gains and then some as the prospect of a hawkish central bank cast a haze of uncertainty over the investing landscape.Markets were mixed Thursday as investors tried to figure out the central bank's intentions.""The reason the market had a knee-jerk reaction yesterday was it sounds like the Fed is going to come fast and furious and take liquidity out of the market,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief market strategist at Ally Financial. ""If they do it in a steady and gradual manner, the market can perform well in that environment. If they come fast and furious, then it's going to be a different story.""Fed officials said during the meeting that they remain data-dependent and will be sure to communicate their intentions clearly to the public.Still, the prospect of a much more aggressive Fed was cause for worry after nearly two years of the most accommodative monetary policy in U.S. history. Bell said investors are likely worrying too much about policy from officials who have been clear that they don't want to do anything to slow the recovery or to tank financial markets.""The Fed sounds like they're going to be a lot quicker in action,"" she said. ""But the reality is we don't honestly know how they're going to move and when they're going to move. That's going to be determined over the next several months."" Indeed, the market won't have to wait long to hear where the Fed is headed.Multiple Fed speakers already have weighed in over the past couple days, with Governor Christopher Waller and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari taking a more aggressive tone. Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Thursday she thinks the start of balance sheet reduction isn't necessarily imminent.Chairman Jerome Powell will speak next week during his confirmation hearing, and a second time this month following the Fed meeting on Jan. 25-26, when he may strike a more dovish tone, said Michael Yoshikami, founder and chairman of Destination Wealth Management.

But if omicron really does continue to be a problem for the next 30 or 45 days, it is going to impact the economy and might cause us to delay raising rates,"" he said. ""I expect that commentary to come out in the next 30 days.""Beyond that, there are some certainties about policy: The market knows, for instance, that the Fed starting in January will be buying just $60 billion of bonds each month — half the level it had been purchasing just a few months ago.Fed officials in December also had penciled in three quarter-percentage-point rate hikes this year after previously indicating just one, and markets are pricing in close to a 50-50 chance of a fourth hike. Also, Powell had indicated that there was discussion about balance sheet reduction at the meeting, though he seemed to play down how deeply his colleagues delved into the topic.So what the market doesn't know right now is how aggressive the Fed will be reducing its balance sheet. It's an important issue for investors as central bank liquidity has helped underpin markets during the Covid tumult.  During the last balance sheet unwind, from 2017 until 2019, the Fed allowed a capped level of proceeds from its bond portfolio to run off. The cap started at $10 billion each month, then increased by $10 billion quarterly until they reached $50 billion. By the time the Fed had to retreat, it had run off just $600 billion from what had been a $4.5 trillion balance sheet.With the balance sheet now approaching $9 trillion — $8.3 trillion of which is comprised of the Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities the Fed has been buying — the initial view from Wall Street is that the Fed could be more aggressive this time. Estimates bandied about following Wednesday's news ranged from maximum caps of $100 billion from JPMorgan Chase to $60 billion at Nomura. Fed officials have not specified any numbers yet, with Kashkari earlier this week only saying that he sees the end of the runoff still leaving the Fed with a large balance sheet, probably bigger than before Covid.One other possibility is that the Fed could sell assets outright, said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.There would be multiple reasons for the central bank to do so, particularly with long-dated interest rates so low, the Fed's bond profile being relatively long in duration and the sheer size of the balance sheet — almost twice what it was last time around.""While longer term yields have rebounded in recent days, if they were to remain stubbornly low and the Fed is faced with a rapidly flattening yield curve, we think there would be a good case that the Fed should supplement its balance sheet runoff with outright sales of longer-dated Treasury securities and MBS,"" Pearce said in a note to clients.That leaves investors with a multitude of possibilities that could make navigating the 2022 landscape difficult.In that last tightening cycle, the Fed waited from the first hike before it started cutting the balance sheet. This time, policymakers seem determined to get things moving more quickly.""Markets are concerned that we've never seen the Federal Reserve both lift interest rates off zero and reduce the size of its balance sheet at the same time. There was a two-year gap between those two events in the last cycle, so it is a valid concern. Our advice is to invest/trade very carefully the next few days,"" DataTrek co-founder Nick Colas said in his daily note Wednesday evening. ""We're not predicting a meltdown, but we get why the market swooned [Wednesday]: these are truly uncharted waters."""
2022-01-06,"World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the unequal distribution of vaccines the biggest failure of 2021. Tedros said low vaccine coverage in many countries of the world contributes to the emergence of new variants, which can undermine global economic growth. The World Health Organization on Thursday warned the unequal distribution of vaccines around the globe has contributed to the emergence of new Covid variants, such as omicron, that threaten the global economic recovery.""Vaccine inequity is a killer of people and jobs, and it undermines a global economic recovery,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during an update from the group's headquarters in Geneva.Tedros said the inability of world leaders to work together to increase vaccine coverage in poorer nations with less-developed health systems was one of the biggest failures of 2021. Low vaccine coverage in many countries was a major factor in the emergence of variants such as delta and omicron, Tedros said. Delta was first detected in India in late 2020 while omicron was first found by health officials in southern Africa in November.The WHO had set a target to vaccinate 40% of the population in every nation of the world by the end of 2021. However, 92 countries did not achieve that despite the distribution of 9 billion shots worldwide, according to the organization.The WHO has set a goal to vaccinate 70% of the population in every country of the world by the middle of this year.

""And this pandemic will not end until we do that.""The International Monetary Fund is expected to downgrade its global growth forecast due to the emergence of the omicron variant. The IMF has delayed the release of its World Economic Outlook until the end of January in order to take the impact of omicron into account.""A new variant that may spread very rapidly can dent confidence, and in that sense, we are likely to see some downgrades of our October projections for global growth,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told Reuters during a virtual conference last month.The IMF in October forecast the global economy would grow 5.9% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022. The organization warned at the time that the emergence of new variants had created increased uncertainty.The IMF projected that the pandemic could reduce gross domestic product worldwide by $5.3 trillion over the next five years compared with current estimates. It called on world leaders to do more to increase vaccine coverage in low-income nations.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last month that omicron poses a risk to U.S. economic growth, but he noted that there are many unknowns about how the variant will impact public health and the economy.Powell said omicron's impact will depend on how much it suppresses demand. The Fed chair said it was unclear how the variant would impact inflation, hiring and economic growth.""The more people who get vaccinated the less economic effect,"" Powell said during a news conference after the Fed's December meeting. ""It doesn't mean it won't have an economic effect,"" he said.Powell said the delta variant slowed hiring and hurt global supply chains during a wave of infection in the fall.The Bank of England's chief economist, Huw Pill, told CNBC last month that omicron poses a ""two-sided"" risk.""Omicron has introduced a new level of uncertainty into our assessment of the economy as a whole, the inflation outlook and the labor market developments,"" Pill said on ""Street Signs Europe."""

The U.S. economy added far fewer jobs than expected in December just as the nation was grappling with a massive surge in Covid cases, the Labor Department said Friday.Nonfarm payrolls grew by 199,000, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That compared with the Dow Jones estimate of 422,000 for the payrolls number and 4.1% for the unemployment rate.  Stock market futures edged lower after the report, while bond yields were in positive territory though off their highs of the morning. Major indexes turned mixed in early afternoon trading, with the Dow up more than 50 points but tech stocks holding back the Nasdaq and S&P 500.Job creation was highest in leisure and hospitality, a key recovery sector, which added 53,000. Professional and business services contributed 43,000, while manufacturing added 26,000.The unemployment rate was a fresh pandemic-era low and near the 50-year low of 3.5% in February 2020. That decline came even though the labor force participation rate was unchanged at 61.9% amid an ongoing labor shortage in the U.S.A more encompassing measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons slid to 7.3%, down 0.4 percentage point. Though the overall jobless rates fell, unemployment for Blacks spiked during the month, rising to 7.1% from 6.5%. The rate for white women 20 years and older fell sharply, to 3.1% from 3.7%.""The new year is off to a rocky start,"" wrote Nick Bunker, economic research director at job placement site Indeed. ""These less than stellar numbers were recorded before the omicron variant started to spread significantly in the United States. Hopefully the current wave of the pandemic will lead to limited labor market damage. The labor market is still recovering, but a more sustainable comeback is only possible in a post-pandemic environment.""  Average hourly earnings rose more than expected as the U.S. sees its fastest inflation pace in nearly 40 years. Wages climbed 0.6% for the month and were up 4.7% year over year. That compares with respective estimates of 0.4% and 4.2%.While the establishment survey showed much lower-than-expected job gains, the household count told a different story, with a gain of 651,000. There also were upward revisions for prior months, with the final October tally pushed up to 648,000, an increase of 102,000, while November's disappointing report gained 39,000 in its first revision to 249,000.The data left the total employment level still 2.9 million shy of where it stood in February 2020, before the pandemic declaration. The labor force participation rate is 1.5 percentage points lower, representing a workforce decline of nearly 2.3 million for the period. There were nearly 4 million more jobs than there were unemployed workers through November.The numbers ""suggest that worker shortages were becoming a bigger restraint on employment growth, even before the Omicron surge in infections, which could knock hundreds of thousands off payrolls in January,"" wrote Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.Other sectors seeing job gains included construction (22,000), transportation and warehousing (19,000), and wholesale trade (14,000).Job creation for the year totaled 6.45 million, easily the highest aggregate gain on record going back to 1940.The numbers come at a crossroads for the U.S. economy as more than half a million new Covid cases per day, many related to the omicron variant, threaten to stall an economic recovery that looks to accelerate in 2022.While growth decelerated through the summer, economists expect that GDP rose sharply at the end of the year, with the Atlanta Fed tracking 6.7% growth.

2022-01-07,"Inflation poses serious challenges for emerging market countries, according to Rachel Ziemba, founder of research firm Ziemba Insights, who pointed to mass protests there that were sparked by fuel hikes.A number of factors including supply chain disruptions and tightening fiscal and monetary issues are intensifying these problems, she said.The unrest started after Kazakhstan's government announced plans to remove the price cap on liquefied petroleum gas, which is commonly used as fuel for cars in the Central Asian country. Rising food and fuel prices pose serious challenges for emerging market countries, according to one economics risk analyst, who pointed to the current mass protests in Kazakhstan that were sparked by fuel hikes.""A lot of countries are facing a challenge of rising food and fuel prices, particularly, since it is also dovetailing with supply chain restrictions and a variety of other issues,"" said Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights, a research firm. ""The challenge is that a number of emerging markets that are already struggling to grow even before the pandemic and throughout it… you're seeing fiscal tightening and monetary tightening at the same time,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Friday.As a result, countries in the region are struggling on how to distribute their wealth, Ziemba noted.This is especially true for a major energy producer like Kazakhstan.""Even for [a] country like Kazakhstan, that's a commodity exporter… they really have struggled to distribute some of that income,"" Ziemba explained.  The unrest started after Kazakhstan's government announced plans to remove the price cap on liquefied petroleum gas, which is used as a common fuel for cars in the Central Asian country. The move caused prices of LPG to double.While the government has since restored the price cap in an attempt to appease the public, protests are still continuing and have now taken a more political tone.Ziemba underlined that Kazakhstan, is one of a number of oil producing countries that had been reluctant until recently to pass on higher prices to their population. But the ""way they did it was very ham-handed in a sense,"" she said, adding the government hasn't really addressed some of the other economic grievances.""But it really isn't just food and fuel prices.

2022-01-10,"While moving home may not seem like a privilege, economists suggest being able to ""boomerang"" home may have its advantages for young workers hoping to save money and search for new jobs.Between February and March 2020, some 2.6 million young adults moved home with their parents. By the middle of 2020, the majority (52%) of young adults between the ages of 18 and 29 lived with at least one parent — and the children of rich parents were the most likely to return home. While the share of young people living with a parent has fallen closer to 47% in recent days, new analysis is showing how wealthy families shelter young adults from the harshest consequences of difficult economic times.According to recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, most young adults who moved in with their parents during the pandemic (often referred to as ""boomerang kids"") come from high-income families. In fact, 36% of boomerang kids come from families that make over $140,000 per year, while just 10% of boomerang kids come from families that make less than $27,000. The median household income was $67,521 in 2020.""The pandemic's having unequal economic effects among young workers,"" says André Victor D. Luduvice, research economist at the Cleveland Fed and author of the report. ""[Boomerang kids] have some cushion to weather economic shock."" The opportunity to move back home can often be a reflection of a family's financial stability, explains Luduvice. He points out that low-income families are less likely to live in homes with open rooms and are less likely to have the expendable resources to accommodate an additional adult. ""On average, boomerang kids come from higher-income families,"" says Luduvice. ""We also see that they're less likely to be married, less likely to have children, and they also are more able to wait out an unemployment spell.""Among unemployed young adults, boomerang kids spent over 22 weeks not working, while unemployed individuals who lived independently spent fewer than 18 weeks looking for work. To be sure, moving home with parents can come with emotional hurdles and not all young people who returned home are financially fortunate.""I always applauded myself for being an independent 20-something who'd been living on her own for the past few years, so it felt strange to be back under my parents' roof,"" wrote Angely Mercado back in May 2020 for CNBC Make It.Mercado lost her job in March 2020, moved back in with her parents and took on work writing ""depressing"" obituaries to make ends meet.""I was embarrassed when I first told my parents about losing my job. I didn't want to be a burden, but my mom assured me that everything was going to be fine. Still, I can't help but check my bank account between assignments. We're barely getting by, and the stimulus checks have yet to arrive."" But for some, family circumstances mean they have extra time to ""wait for a better job: potentially a higher-income job, or a job that is more suited to your needs, or a job that has less Covid exposure."" According to the researchers, young adults who do not live with their parents were nearly twice as likely to work in a job that puts them at a high risk of exposure to the virus. Luduvice points out that many boomerang kids are in school, while young adults who live independently are significantly less likely to be in school.Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute says while it may be surprising that young adults from wealthier families would move home, there are some possible explanations.For instance, since young adults from wealthier backgrounds are more likely to attend higher education, it makes sense why these students stayed home while campuses were closed. Plus, even young adults from higher-income families ""may be paying off college debt.""""And I wonder if these people may also be more likely to have jobs where they can telecommute, and so they can work from their parent's house because it doesn't matter where they live,"" she says. ""But people who are lower-income, maybe they have to stay close to their jobs and so they didn't have that option.""Don't miss: Biden administration extends the student loan pause through May 1—but advocates want more13 U.S. workers die on the job per day, on average—and these are the most dangerous jobsWhy economists say you should ask for a raise in the New Year"

2022-01-10,"Asian countries will face three major headwinds for the year head, according to Carlos Casanova senior economist, Asia at Swiss private bank UBP.More broadly, the emerging markets in the region — while well positioned, will be more impacted by these factors, Casanova pointed out, especially if the Fed moves aggressively on the policy front. Asian countries will face three major headwinds in the year ahead, according to Carlos Casanova senior economist, Asia at Swiss private bank UBP.""We have rising omicron cases. We have priced in slower growth in China at around 5%. And now, the Fed meeting minutes suggest that the pace of the tapering will be faster-than-expected,"" he told CNBC ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Friday, adding that these factors ""pose a threat for the region as a whole.""The U.S. central bank spooked investors last week after minutes of its December meeting signaled members were ready to tighten monetary policy more aggressively than previously expected.The Federal Reserve indicated it may be ready to start raising interest rates, dial back on its bond-buying program, and engage in high-level discussions about reducing holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.While Asia's emerging markets are well positioned, they will be more impacted by these factors — especially if the Fed moves aggressively on the policy front, Casanova pointed out. ""There will be a real rate compression between emerging markets in Asia and the U.S,"" he said. This may lead to further outflows of bonds in the region, especially from economies that are more vulnerable, he added.In 2013, the Fed triggered a so-called ""taper tantrum"" when it began to wind down its asset purchase program. Investors panicked and it triggered a sell-off in bonds, causing Treasury yields to surge.As a result, emerging markets in Asia suffered sharp capital outflows and currency depreciation, forcing central banks in the region to hike interest rates to protect their capital accounts.It all depends on how the Fed goes about normalizing its policy in the coming months, Casanova said.""What we are fighting to avoid is a situation, whereby, they are more proactive in reducing their balance sheet at the same time as they're implementing three rate hikes in 2022,"" he noted, saying that potentially could translate to further outflows from the region and deflationary pressures."
2022-01-11,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the economy is both healthy enough and in need of tighter monetary policy.That likely will entail interest rate hikes, tapering of monthly asset purchases and a smaller balance sheet.Powell made the comments during a confirmation hearing in which key senators indicated they will be supporting him for a second term. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, with a seemingly clear path to a second term heading the central bank, declared Tuesday that the U.S. economy is both healthy enough and in need of tighter monetary policy.As part of his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Powell said he expects a series of interest rate hikes this year, along with other reductions in the extraordinary help the Fed has been providing during the pandemic era.""As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we'll be normalizing policy, meaning we're going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we'll be raising rates over the course of the year,"" he told committee members. ""At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that's just the road to normalizing policy."" He made the remarks during a 2½-hour session that included both praise for the Fed's handling of the economy and criticism over perceived ethical lapses from central bank officials. Some Republican senators also expressed worries over whether the Fed was veering too far from its stated objectives of price stability, full employment and banking oversight.Ultimately, though, Powell appeared headed toward a successful confirmation from the full Senate. Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick Toomey, the ranking Republican, both said they plan on supporting President Joe Biden's nomination. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has said she will oppose the nomination, after calling Powell ""dangerous"" during a hearing last year.Many of the questions from both sides of the aisle centered on inflation, which is running at a close to 40-year high. After declaring the surge ""transitory"" for much of 2021, the Fed has pivoted on inflation and is expected to raise rates three or four times this year in quarter percentage-point increments.Higher interest rates control inflation by slowing down the flow of money, which has been running rapidly through the economy as the Fed and Congress have combined to provide more than $10 trillion worth of stimulus.""If we see inflation persisting at high levels longer than expected, then if we have to raise interest more over time, we will,"" Powell said. ""We will use our tools to get inflation back."" In addition to rate hikes, the Fed also is tapering its monthly bond purchases, which have added more than $4.5 trillion to its balance sheet since the early days of the pandemic. Officials also have indicated they will start decreasing the balance sheet later this year, mostly likely by allowing a set level of proceeds to run off each month, though the Fed also could sell assets outright.Powell said the moves are in response to an economy that has both a strong jobs picture, with an unemployment rate at 3.9% in December, but with inflation expected to top 7% year over year for the same period. ""What that's really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we've had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath,"" Powell said. ""We're really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But it's a long road to normal from where we are.""He faced some questioning about why the Fed got its inflation call wrong, and he again cited issues mostly related to the pandemic, which has seen clogged supply chains, sparsely stocked store shelves and rising prices that Powell said could threaten the recovery.""If inflation does become persistent, if these high levels of inflation get entrenched in our economy and people's thinking, then inevitably that will lead to much higher monetary policy from this,"" he said. ""That could lead to a recession and that will be bad for workers.""Powell also faced questions about a controversy in recent months over the financial activities of several officials around the time the Fed was about to implement a series of rescue measures just before the pandemic declaration.Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida announced Monday that he is resigning a few weeks ahead of the end of his term following additional disclosures about his buying and selling of equity funds. Regional Fed presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan of Dallas resigned in 2021 following similar disclosures.Powell said the Fed soon would be publishing rules that would prohibit similar activities without 45 days' notice.""The old system was in place for decades and then suddenly it was revealed insufficient,"" he said of the prior rules."
2022-01-11,"December marked another month of sluggish job growth yet slight progress for women re-entering the labor force amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, reports the National Women's Law Center. The economy added just 199,000 jobs in December, with women gaining about 24% of those new positions. An estimated 321,000 women entered the labor force last month, bumping women's labor force participation rate to 57.8% from 57.5%, according to the Bureau of Statistics' latest jobs report. ""There are certainly some positive signs in last month's report,"" Julie Vogtman, the director of job quality and senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, tells CNBC Make It. ""More women are looking for work, and wages are growing, but we can expect the omicron variant to disrupt, or even reverse, this progress in the coming months."" Vogtman credits the uptick in women's labor force participation to schools re-opening and more companies hiring ahead of the new year. Still, the latest report does not reflect the full impact of the omicron variant, she adds. Several groups saw a sharp drop in unemployment last month, including white women (3.7% to 3.1%), Latinas (5.3% to 4.9%) and Asian women (3.9% to 3.3%). Black women's unemployment spiked last month, however, rising to 6.2% from 4.9%. This increase can be attributed to both job losses and labor force entries. In December, most job gains went to white women – 538,000 more women were employed in December 2021 than in November, and of those women, 463,000 were white. Black women lost 8,000 jobs.More than 140,000 Black women joined the labor force in December seeking work but were not hired for open positions. For example, the leisure and hospitality sector created 53,000 jobs in December – and while men gained 57,000 positions, women lost 4,000 jobs, despite making up about 53% of the workforce. While men gained 700 retail jobs in December, women gained none. Black women are overrepresented in both of these industries and thus ""bore the brunt"" of these losses, Vogtman adds. At December's rate, the NWLC estimates that it would take 45 months to gain back the nearly 2 million jobs women have lost during the pandemic.""Our job market devalues the work that women, and particularly women of color, do,"" Vogtman says. ""The service sector positions women of color disproportionately hold are also the ones that have been the most volatile and battered by the pandemic."" ""Black women still continue to face discrimination and other barriers to employment, and they tend to be overrepresented in industries that don't offer competitive pay or benefits, like retail or hospitality jobs, so there's unwillingness to accept a low paid job without basic benefits like sick time as the pandemic continues,"" Jasmine Tucker, the NWLC's director of research, told CNBC Make It in December.Over one in three women (34.2%) who were unemployed in November had been out of work for six months or longer. While Vogtman fears that this number could spike as variants of the virus spread, hiring managers can mitigate some of the obstacles keeping women from working. Offering employees higher wages and more paid sick leave would be a great start – but flexible work schedules could be a ""game-changer"" for keeping women in the workforce, and enticing more to return, Vogtman notes, as it could help them better manage caregiving responsibilities.""The pandemic has created a vicious cycle of instability and unpredictability in people's lives,"" she says. ""The least women can count on is the number of hours they're working and the money in their paycheck each week.""Check out:The top 20 companies on a hiring spree for remote workers this yearYankees' Rachel Balkovec makes history as the first female manager in minor league baseball35% of women who left or lost their jobs during the pandemic are still unemployedSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"
2022-01-11,"Surging inflation will continue to be a significant pain-point for India's economy as the country grapples with a third wave of Covid-19 infections., according to an economist.Inflation has been a concern for India for over three years now, said Charu Chanana, lead economist, Asia at Continuum Economics, an independent research firm. Surging inflation will continue to be a significant ""pain-point"" for India's economy as the country battles a third wave of Covid-19 infections, according to one economist.Rising prices have been a concern for India for over three years now, said Charu Chanana, lead economist for Asia at Continuum Economics, an independent research firm.In the first quarter, ""we actually do see inflation getting above the 6% level — which is at the upper limit of the RBI central bank,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Tuesday, referring to the Reserve Bank of India.""The omicron wave suggests further challenges. In all of the previous Covid-19 waves, we've seen significant supply chain impacts. And the impact on inflation has been significant,"" she pointed out. It is going to be one of the ""most important pain-points for the economy right now,"" she added.In the central bank's latest Financial Stability Report released last week, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das underscored that the Indian economy faces headwinds from global developments and more recently, the emergence of the highly transmissible omicron variant. ""Inflation remains a concern buffeted as it is by the build-up of cost-push pressures,"" he said.The report further noted that even before omicron, global growth and trade were starting to lose steam, stalled by factors such as supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks.""These forces, along with elevated commodity prices, have rendered inflationary pressures persistent across geographies, posing a serious risk to global economic prospects,"" the central bank said. India's Covid-19 cases are rising again as several states such as Delhi and Mumbai grapple with a growing number of infections attributed to the omicron variant.But unlike the delta wave, India is better prepared to handle the omicron variant this time around due to rising vaccination rates, said Chanana.""Vaccinations are much better than where India was at the time of the delta wave. We are looking at vaccinating 15-year-olds, plus we are looking at booster shots — that should help drive through this wave,"" she added.The latest government data showed 168,000 new cases over a 24-hour period on Tuesday. Cumulative vaccination levels were at more than 1.53 billion vaccine doses as of Tuesday, the data showed.So far, nearly 45% of the country's population has been fully vaccinated as of Jan. 9, according to Our World in Data. Still, vaccination rates are low in India compared with other developed markets, Chanana noted.""I think one other point of concern here is that the omicron wave we've seen in the U.S. and U.K. – they mostly relied on mRNA vaccines to immunize their populations,"" she said. ""India has so far only relied on local vaccines, and it remains to be seen how effective they do well against the new variant.""

Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the PPI index to gain 11.1% after a 12.9% rise in November.Factory inflation has moderated from record highs in recent weeks as Beijing intervened to stabilize high raw material prices and ease an energy power crunch.The softer inflation also leaves the door open for more monetary easing as the world's second-largest economy slows and faces a series of headwinds in 2022, including property woes, a slowing manufacturing sector and Covid-19 outbreaks.China's consumer price index (CPI) grew 1.5% year-on-year in December.Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a 1.8% uptick, after a 2.3% increase in November.The CPI rose 0.9% year-on-year in 2021, down from a 2.5% gain in 2020.Measures to contain COVID-19 outbreaks are also likely to weigh on the economic outlook as the world battles the Omicron coronavirus variant.Chinese cities are already advising people to stay put for the Lunar New Year, a peak travel period, due to fresh coronavirus outbreaks in several places, such as the central Henan province and northern Tianjin city."
2022-01-12,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday touted the latest consumer inflation report as evidence that price jumps have started to slow.While he acknowledged that the economy has a long way to go, Biden noted that the latest CPI report shows that ""we are making progress in slowing the rate of price increases.""The president's remarks came hours after the Labor Department said that Americans paid 0.5% more for goods and services in December.Biden's remarks highlight what many economists say is evidence that inflation increases appear to be peaking. President Joe Biden on Wednesday touted the new consumer inflation report as evidence that price jumps have started to slow, but acknowledged that the economy has a ways to go before Americans see cost hikes return to a typical level.""Today's report—which shows a meaningful reduction in headline inflation over last month, with gas prices and food prices falling—demonstrates that we are making progress in slowing the rate of price increases,"" the president said in a prepared statement.""At the same time, this report underscores that we still have more work to do,"" he added, ""with price increases still too high and squeezing family budgets.""The president's remarks came hours after the Labor Department said that Americans paid 0.5% more for goods and services in December. That increase put the year-over-year inflation jump at a whopping 7%, the hottest 12-month price gain since 1982. But Biden's remarks highlight what many economists see as evidence that inflation increases appear to be peaking. Prices rose 0.3% in August, 0.4% in September, 0.9% in October, 0.8% in November and 0.5% in December, according to the Labor Department.Should that trend continue, the lofty year-over-year jumps would ease.While this downtrend does not suggest that prices are declining, it does indicate that the rate of price increases is falling. That would start the process by which year-over-year inflation would recede back to the Federal Reserve's 2% target.  Still, price spikes without similar jumps in consumers' wages mean many Americans cannot afford to buy as many gallons of gasoline, bunches of grapes, used cars and haircuts, for example, as they could one year ago. Runaway inflation tends to make voters unhappy as they feel their purchasing power erode.Real average hourly earnings, which take consumer prices into account, rose 0.1% from November to December, the Labor Department said Wednesday. But they fell 2.4% from the previous year.Most economists, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, say the Covid-19 pandemic has caused the current bout of inflation. He and others say that the global supply chain has not been able to keep up with strong demand for goods among consumers and businesses.Lawmakers on Tuesday voiced their complaints about inflation to Powell during his nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Biden chose Powell for a second term leading the central bank.Checking inflation will ""require us to use our tools, to the extent that they work on the demand side, while we also expect some help from the supply side,"" the Fed chair told lawmakers. Powell also signaled the central bank would start to hike interest rates this year to control price increases.The pandemic has shuttered factories, disrupted shipping routes and undermined corporate efforts to hire workers to bring production up to speed. The resulting inflation threatens to hamstring Democrats in the key 2022 midterm elections as voters name the economy their top priority and give Biden poor marks for his handling of it.The White House on Wednesday acknowledged those frustrations and tried to assuage concerns about households affording food and other goods. National Economic Council Director Brian Deese told reporters that the administration is focused more on month-to-month than year-over-year changes, noting that independent forecasters project a ""moderation in price increases over the course of 2022.""He also pointed to signs of a slowdown in food price inflation. While grocery costs increased during November and December, the rate of price hikes declined.""We saw some welcomed deceleration in the increase in the cost of food,"" said Deese.Biden also aimed to assuage Americans' concerns in his statement Wednesday, saying a health economy would help the U.S. manage inflation.""Inflation is a global challenge, appearing in virtually every developed nation as it emerges from the pandemic economic slump,"" he said. ""America is fortunate that we have one of the fastest growing economies—thanks in part to the American Rescue Plan—which enables us to address price increases and maintain strong, sustainable economic growth.""— CNBC's Sevanny Campos contributed to this report"
2022-01-12,"Inflation grew 7% in December from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Labor said Wednesday. Average hourly wages also increased by 4.7%.That amounts to a pay cut of more than 2%, on average.However, the experience for workers will differ widely based on their job and what they buy. Inflation is taking a big bite out of workers' paychecks, eroding many of the raises businesses have offered to attract and keep employees in a hot job market.But strong wage growth in certain sectors, such as hotels and restaurants, has eclipsed those consumer price leaps — at least for now.The biggest raises have come in some of the country's lowest-paying jobs, helping insulate cash-strapped households from rising prices for staples like food.More from Personal Finance:Rising inflation may affect your 2021 tax billTax filers should expect delaysBank of America is cutting overdraft feesThe Consumer Price Index, a key inflation measure, jumped 7% in December from a year ago, the fastest rate since June 1982, the U.S. Department of Labor said Wednesday.The index accounts for costs across many goods and services, from alcohol to fruit, airfare, firewood, hospital services and musical instruments. On average, a consumer who paid $100 a year ago would pay $107 today.Average pay also jumped significantly in 2021 — to more than $31 an hour, a 4.7% annual increase, the Labor Department reported Friday. Despite that pay bump, higher consumer prices ate into household budgets. In effect, the average worker got a 2.4% pay cut last year, according to seasonally adjusted data published by the Labor Department.""In what was the best year for wage growth that we have seen in many, many years, it still comes up as a loss for many households,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate. ""Their expenses increased even faster and chewed up all of the benefit of whatever pay raise they had seen."" So-called real earnings (wages minus inflation) fluctuate widely from household to household. The experience will differ based on consumers' jobs and what they buy.For example, rank-and-file workers in leisure and hospitality — the lowest-paying sector of the U.S. economy — got a nearly 16% raise in 2021, to $16.97 an hour. That means the average employee at a bar, restaurants and hotel saw pay rise more than two times faster than inflation, amounting to a net 9% increase in annual pay.Similarly, rank-and-file workers in transportation and warehousing saw their annual pay rise 8.4%, to $25.04 an hour in December. Retail workers got a 7% increase to $19.20. These either exceeded or matched inflation. Employers have had difficulty finding workers to fill jobs in these sectors, according to Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor, a career site.High demand for labor (amid a near-record number of job openings) has pushed businesses to raise pay. The wages also reflect realities of the pandemic — workers may want a bigger paycheck to compensate for the higher risk accompanying these front-line roles, Zhao said.While wage gains have outstripped inflation for some lower earners, that doesn't seem to be the experience for most households, Zhao added.""The typical experience is [that] inflation has likely taken a significant bite out of workers' paychecks,"" he said. Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and former economic advisor to President Barack Obama, found that wage growth among the bottom 25% of earners outpaced consumer prices in the two years through November 2021. The remainder of workers have gotten a new pay cut, he said.While average pay at the lower end has outpaced inflation, that doesn't necessarily mean the jobs are paying a living wage, according to a Brookings Institution analysis of recent pay raises.""Headlines about rising wages for frontline workers — even rising real wages — often obscure the reality that wage levels are still low,"" the analysis said. ""In today's inflationary environment, even as wages rise, so does the minimal threshold for an acceptable wage level."" Prices gains have occurred across a broad swath of goods, but the increases aren't equally distributed.Americans who use public transit may have dodged some of the year's biggest jump in costs — in gasoline and used cars and trucks, for example. (They jumped 50% and 37%, respectively.)Staples like rent and groceries are harder to avoid. (Their costs were up 3.3% and 6.5% on the year, respectively.) Consumers may change buying behavior to reduce the budget sting, perhaps substituting chicken or fish for beef (which jumped 19%), for instance.An increase in annual rent may prove longer-lasting than in other areas, according to economists. Even a small increase in percentage terms can quickly erode any paycheck gains for lower-earning renters, McBride said.It's unclear how long inflation or wage gains will last. Many economists believe both will start to taper in 2022, if supply bottlenecks ease (helping to reduce prices) and virus cases wane (increasing the supply of workers)."

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pledged to bring down his country's soaring inflation, which hit 36% in December, as the country's central bank gears up for another rate-setting meeting next week.Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, Erdogan said he was protecting the country's economy from attacks by ""foreign financial tools that can disrupt the financial system,"" according to a translation by Reuters.

""There is NO foreign plot.""Turkey's lira lost 44% of its value in 2021, due in large part to a refusal by the president — who essentially controls the levers of the Turkish central bank — to raise interest rates to rein in inflation. And Turks themselves are looking beyond the lira as they lose hope in their own currency: Turkish stores are now starting to display prices in U.S. dollars, and Turks are putting their money into cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether. ""If RTE [Recep Tayyip Erdogan] wants to save the lira, and maybe his own skin, he should adopt a USD-based currency board,"" Steve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday, saying Turkey is ""spontaneously dollarizing.""His tweet featured an article by Israeli daily Haaretz entitled ""Even the Turkish Lira stopped believing in Erdogan."" An avowed opponent of interest rates, Erdogan instead outlined an alternative set of measures to bolster the lira. The plan essentially entails protecting local depositors against market volatility by paying them the difference if the lira's decline against hard currencies surpass banks' interest rates.Critics say this plan is unsustainable, and is essentially one large hidden interest rate hike. And central bank reserves are already falling: Central bank gross reserves decreased by $1.6 billion to $109.4 billion in the first week of January, according to Goldman Sachs, ""driven by the decline in foreign currency reserves which stood at US$71.0 billion.""The state's currency interventions, spending dollars to buy lira in order to stabilize it, have been costly.The lira appeared to be in free fall in mid-December, dropping as low as 18 to the dollar before the government announced its rescue plan. The intervention has managed to bring the currency back to just under 14 to the dollar and keep stable there for the past week, though that's a dramatic fall from its level of 7 to the dollar just one year ago. The picture isn't entirely bleak: Turkey showed positive figures for industrial production and retail sales in November, which ""suggested that Turkey's economy held up well during the early part of the currency crisis,"" wrote Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.""But we doubt that this strength will last for much longer as the more pernicious effects created by very large falls in the lira in December filter through,"" Tuvey added.""While export sectors may hold up well, consumer-led ones will suffer amid a surge in inflation, which hit 36.1% y/y in December and is set to rise further.""  Analysts estimate Turkey's short-term debt to be just above $180 billion, with a current account deficit of around $10-$20 billion, leaving gross external financing requirements at around $200 billion. With central bank gross reserves at about $109 billion and likely to keep dropping with dollarization, spending to support the lira and potential further foreign capital flight, financing for that currency reserve coverage does not look very strong.So how long can the central bank keep intervening to prop up the lira? ""The answer is not very long if it continues to keep up the pace of intervention seen in December, which remember only held the lira flat over the month,"" Ash wrote.Meanwhile, Erdogan continues to push his own economic theories, insisting Wednesday that the link between interest rates and inflation has long been disregarded in some other countries — a comment that some critics have noted would liken Turkey to Argentina, Venezuela or Iran in terms of monetary policy.""I worry about the messaging now to foreign investors,"" Ash wrote.""Erdogan is telling the world that Turkey does not need foreign capital, foreign portfolio investors are not welcome and Turks can finance their own economy. His economic policy mantra is already not liked ... Investors I think are asking themselves why they should continue to finance bad policies from the Erdogan administration? Will any new issue money just disappear in ineffective and idiotic FX intervention, and is Turkey heading to a systemic crisis?"""
2022-01-13,"In the past 20 years used cars' contribution to inflation averaged zero. It's now more than 1% on a year-over-year basis, according to the White House.The price of used cars is also having an outsized high impact on overall headline inflation, according to Jared Bernstein, an economic advisor to President Joe Biden.Cox Automotive reports the average retail price for a used vehicle was a new record of more than $28,000 in December.The potential upside for the Biden administration is that inflation is expected to moderate organically and as the Federal Reserve looks to raise interest rates this year. Despite President Joe Biden's upbeat comments on what seem to be early signs of a peak in inflation, used car prices continue to rise at levels not seen at any time this century prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Biden administration has blamed much of the rising inflation rates in the country on the used vehicle market. The problem, which the White House acknowledges, is that there's not much it can do to assist in lowering the rates right now.In the past 20 years used cars' contribution to inflation averaged zero. It's now more than 1% on a year-over-year basis, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In December, prices consumers paid for goods and services rose 0.5% while used car prices rose 3.5%. Based on a weighted calculation of that price change and Americans' demand for used cars, the Labor Department estimates that used car prices contributed 0.112 percentage points to the overall 0.5% increase.The price of used cars is also having a historically high impact on overall headline inflation, according to White House economic advisor Jared Bernstein. Bernstein, who sits on Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote that he finds used cars' impact on headline inflation ""remarkable and revealing.""""It's a reminder of how extremely unusual this current inflation is,"" he continued. ""The world has not forgotten how to produce new (and thus used) cars and we should expect this series to revert once the underlying supply constraint eases.""Reflecting a view held by most economists, Bernstein wrote that the primary supply-chain hiccup responsible for both used car inflation and its impact on the consumer price index data is a shortage of semiconductors used in the manufacturing of new cars.

Tim Scott of South Carolina files paperwork to run for presidentG-7 leaders commit to more Russia sanctions with Ukraine's Zelenskyy set to attend summit Economists say that backlog is thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, which shuttered factories around the world and disrupted shipping routes over the past two years. Those logistical hurdles are believed the chief suspect behind a massive 25% climb in used car prices in 2021, according to industry insights company Cox Automotive.But the pandemic changed consumers' demand for cars and forced hundreds of thousands to cancel or postpone travel plans in 2020. That one-time mass cancellation led to unprecedented demand for cars in the spring of 2021 as vaccines and relaxed public-health rules allowed entire populations to schedule vacations and other travel at the same time.""There's still a lot of demand out there that just has not been met yet. It's unsatiated demand,"" Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist and senior director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, told CNBC. ""Until the new market can rebuild such that demand is met and that there is enough product out there for everybody, the U.S. markets are going to continue to be doing very robust sales.""Simply put: Without new vehicles, you can't have used vehicles.Cox Automotive reports the average retail price for a used vehicle was a new record of more than $28,000 in December.""I think there's very little reason to expect to see any kind of price decline in the use vehicle market anytime soon,"" Chesbrough said.The president's approval ratings have suffered in recent months, and many surveyed voters told CNBC and Change Research that they are concerned about the Biden administration's handling of the economy. Sixty percent of the survey's 1,895 respondents said they disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy, a six-percentage-point decline in approval from September.But the White House is doing all it can to stress to Americans that it's doing all it can to remedy the price increases.As Bernstein noted on Twitter, there are some measures the White House is pursuing that could help ease car price pressure in the longer term. The pending U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, which the Senate passed in June, would pour billions into domestic chip production as Washington looks to curb China's dominance in the industry.The potential upside for the Biden administration is that inflation is expected to moderate organically and as the Federal Reserve looks to raise interest rates this year.Used-vehicle prices normally increase in the spring, so Cox Automotive expects pricing to continue to increase. But in the second half of the year, the company is forecasting inflation to end, and a more normal pattern of depreciation to resume.Bank of America economist Alex Lin told CNBC last month that in used car prices — and overall inflation — face some fierce year-over-year comparisons starting in the spring. The thinking goes that if sellers hiked used car prices in early 2021, they would have to have to hike them by the same percent this year if inflation is to remain at the same levels.And that, Lin said, is pretty unlikely.""Wholesale prices since the pandemic are up more than 60%,"" Lin said in December. ""So the question is: Will we see another 60% next year?""""I mean, I hope not,"" he added. ""But I guess I would be skeptical about that as a base case."""
2022-01-13,"As Chinese local authorities impose more travel restrictions and a few lockdowns to contain the omicron Covid variant, analysts are turning cautious on China's economy.The greatest impact of the zero-Covid policy has been on hotels and restaurants, according to analysis from Dan Wang, Shanghai-based chief economist at Hang Seng China.China's ""zero-Covid policy can one hand ensure the retail activity, industrial activity can carry on, but if the world is successful in the way of 'living with [the] virus,' China may risk the growth divergence between the two,"" said Gary Ng, Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis. BEIJING — China's zero-Covid policy for controlling the pandemic affects consumers more than factories, economists say.As local authorities impose more travel restrictions and a few lockdowns to contain the omicron Covid variant, analysts are turning cautious on China's economy. Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecast for the year on Tuesday.But the analysts focused on the impact to China's already sluggish consumer spending.Omicron's high transmissibility means the costs of China's zero-Covid policy are rising, while benefits are falling, Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu said in a report Monday. He noted how in hospitality, business has yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels and industry workers might be draining their savings and spending less.Not on the list of costs was manufacturing.On the positive side, ""the zero-Covid strategy, plus Beijing's ability to mobilize all the country's resources, has arguably brought significant benefits to its people and economy, with an official death count of just four since mid-April 2020, factories firing on all cylinders, and an impressive 31.0% [year-on-year] export growth in the first eleven months of the year,"" Nomura's Lu said. Since the pandemic began in early 2020, China's policy has used quarantines and travel restrictions — whether within a city or with other countries — to control outbreaks. After a first-quarter contraction, the country became the only major economy to grow that year.The greatest impact of the zero-Covid policy has been on hotels and restaurants, according to analysis from Dan Wang, Shanghai-based chief economist at Hang Seng China. Manufacturing and agriculture were the least affected and have contributed the most to growth, her study found.Wang's analysis compared GDP figures in 2020 and 2021 to a four-year average of China's annual GDP growth rate between 2016 and 2019, before the pandemic.""By containing the Covid spread, China [has] been able to make sure that all nodes along the supply chain worked so that actually agricultural and industrial output ... have both been higher than the trend value,"" she said in a phone interview last week.Industrial production grew by 2.8% in 2020 and rose by 10.1% in the first 11 months of 2021 from the same period a year ago. China's factory activity unexpectedly increased in December, according to an official measure called the Purchasing Manager's Index. Although China's economy faces a number of challenges from surging commodity prices to a crackdown on the massive real estate industry, economic data indicate resilience in factory production.In China, manufacturers are less affected by city lockdowns since factories are typically spread out in suburban industrial parks, where employees live in dormitories, said Yue Su, principal economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit.She noted how Apple supplier Foxconn was able to maintain production at its factory in Zhengzhou, Henan, this past summer despite historic flooding that killed more than 300 people in the province. Su expects different local government approaches to implementing a zero-Covid policy will result in varying economic performance by province this year.""For example in Shanghai, when there is a positive case, they will only lock down the district or the street,"" she said. ""But for governments that have limited healthcare resource[s], they tend to lock down the whole city immediately, like what happened in Xi'an.""Xi'an in central China is one of the country's many industrial hubs. The lockdown since late December of a city of 13 million people contributed to Citi Chief China Economist Li-Gang Liu's expectation that industrial production could fall to 3.5% year-on-year growth in December, from 3.8% in November.But Liu expects China's trade growth ""to remain robust"" despite a high base of the last two years.More than half of China's goods manufactured for export come from the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, on the south or southeastern coast near Shanghai. The less developed areas lie in the central and western parts of China, a country of 1.4 billion people.China's export growth remained resilient throughout 2021, despite multiple warnings of slowing demand from overseas.The risk is this time around, factories in other countries may be able to operate if their governments decide to pursue a strategy of coexistence with Covid.China's ""zero-Covid policy can one hand ensure the retail activity, industrial activity can carry on, but if the world is successful in the way of 'living with [the] virus,' China may risk the growth divergence between the two,"" said Gary Ng, Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis. Analysts expect China will stick to the zero-Covid policy through the end of this year due to politically important events, from the Beijing Winter Olympics in February to a Chinese Communist Party leadership meeting expected in the fall.That adds pressure to local government leaders, who are often fired after a surge of Covid cases in their city.The stringent policy has become politically sensitive in other ways. U.S.-based consulting firm Eurasia Group on Jan. 3 named the top risk for 2022 as China's failure to achieve zero-Covid, requiring more severe lockdowns and adding to supply chain disruptions. Chinese state media swiftly criticized the report with English-language opinion pieces and a cartoon.Authorities are also concerned about the country's already tight hospitalization capacity.China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a study in November that said shifting to the coexistence strategy of other countries would likely result in hundreds of thousands of new daily cases and devastate the national medical system.

In October, the country's leading research institutes slashed their forecasts for growth in 2021 to 2.4%. The German government also lowered its expectations for annual growth in 2021.Looking ahead, upcoming economic performance remains clouded by uncertainty.On Thursday, Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute, warned that the number of new Covid cases is continuing to increase rapidly.

In addition, Germany saw an increase in net borrowing in 2021.The statistics office said that financial deficit stood at 153.9 billion euros ($176.46 billion) at the end of the year — higher than the 145.2 billion euros recorded in the previous year."
2022-01-14,"India reported 247,417 new infections over a 24-hour period on Thursday, according to government data.The sharp rise in cases have led economists to become more cautious about the January-March quarter outlook, but they also expect less severe impact than before.Citi economists revised down their growth projections for India: The estimated GDP for fiscal 2022 was revised by 80 basis points to 9%. India is experiencing a third wave of Covid infections — while its overall impact is expected to be less disruptive than previous waves, some economists are predicting slower growth in the near term.The economic impact of the new wave could be relatively less severe in the first three months of 2022, Citi economists Samiran Chakraborty and Baqar M Zaidi wrote in a Jan. 9 note.But they pointed out that the momentum for India's economic activity between October and December fell below expectations, even before the third wave hit.That led the Citi economists to revise down their inflation-adjusted GDP estimates for India for fiscal year 2022. Growth is predicted to fall by 80 basis points from 9.8% year-on-year to 9% largely due to weaker economic activity in the October-December quarter, Chakraborty and Zaidi said.Consequently, they also revised down their fiscal 2023 growth estimates from 8.7% year-on-year to 8.3%.India's fiscal year 2022 ends in March, and its fiscal year 2023 starts on April 1 and ends Mar. 31 next year. Covid cases are surging in India again, with daily figures exceeding 150,000 in recent days.Government data showed India reported 247,417 new infections over a 24-hour period on Thursday, with the daily positivity rate — which measures the share of Covid-19 tests that are positive — at 13.11%.There are more than 1.1 million active cases of infection in the country, according to the data.So far, India has identified 5,488 cases of Covid infections that were caused by the new, highly contagious omicron variant that was first detected by South African scientists. It is likely that the number of omicron cases in India is much higher than what has officially been reported so far as it takes time for genetic sequencing to determine if a person with Covid contracted the new strain.The predominant strain in India is still delta.While India's health-care infrastructure is relatively better prepared to tackle the third wave, a rapid uptick in cases could potentially push it to the brink again.""Regional variations in access to healthcare personnel, medical facilities, oxygen ventilators and critical care underscore the need for proactive action before caseloads intensify beyond the metros,"" Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS Group, said in a Jan. 6 note. The impact of the third wave could potentially worsen in the coming weeks and months. Thousands of pilgrims are expected to gather at the Ganges River in the eastern state of West Bengal this week for an annual festival, local media reports said.Last year, a similar large-scale religious gathering was partly responsible for the devastating second wave of infections between February and May. While the sharp rise in cases led economists to become more cautious about the January-March quarter outlook, they are also expecting a less severe impact than before.""We expect far less economic damage from the current outbreak compared to the first two waves of infections as the economy has adjusted to be more resilient to Covid-related disruptions,"" Priyanka Kishore, head of India and Southeast Asia economics at Oxford Economics, wrote in a Jan. 8 note.Still, she said Oxford Economics has lowered its growth forecast for the January-March quarter by almost 0.5 percentage points to 2.5% quarter-on-quarter to ""reflect the third wave of Covid infections.""The latest surge is expected to lead to another slump in India's private consumption as states step up restrictions to limit the spread of the virus. She added that the subsequent April-June to quarter is set to be the start of a more ""durable recovery"" as by then, a large percentage of the population are expected to be fully vaccinated.Citi's economists said there are reasons to be hopeful for a less disruptive Covid wave. They include: lower hospitalization rates — such as what's currently seen in cities like Mumbai — a shorter Covid wave cycle, higher vaccination coverage and a weakening link between Covid and economic activity.""Higher vaccination coverage will provide support to policymakers in avoiding strict restrictions,"" they wrote.India has fully inoculated nearly 70% of its adult population and rolled out a vaccination drive this year for those between 15 and 18 years old. It's unlikely that the Reserve Bank of India would consider raising interest rates before the second quarter as the central bank looks to prioritize growth risks over near-term inflation spike, according to Kishore from Oxford Economics.Rising prices are a concern as retail inflation in India hit a 5-month high in December.DBS Group's Rao said the RBI last month indicated its preference for ""a gradual road towards policy normalisation,"" and diverging from global policy shifts — particularly from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Supply disruptions could potentially keep inflation on the upper end of the RBI's 2% to 6% target range in fiscal 2023, according to Rao.""Sticky inflation and global rate adjustments prompt us to retain our call for the repo rate to be adjusted by a cumulative 50bps in 2H,"" she said."
2022-01-14,"The world's fifth-biggest economy was 0.7% bigger than it was in February 2020, the ONS said.        Economists polled by Reuters had forecast monthly gross domestic product growth of 0.4% for November. Britain's economy grew by a much stronger-than-expected 0.9% in November, finally taking it above its size just before the country went into its first COVID-19 lockdown, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.The world's fifth-biggest economy was 0.7% bigger than it was in February 2020, the ONS said.        Economists polled by Reuters had forecast monthly gross domestic product growth of 0.4% for November.""It's amazing to see the size of the economy back to pre-pandemic levels in November – a testament to the grit and determination of the British people,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.Other economies have already recovered their pre-COVID size, chief among them the United States. Despite November's growth acceleration, GDP probably took a hit in December when the Omicron coronavirus variant swept Europe, and the loss of momentum is likely to have stretched into January with many firms reporting severe staff absences and consumers still wary of going out.But health officials think the Omicron infections wave has now peaked in Britain and analysts say the hit to the economy is likely to be short-lived, allowing the Bank of England to continue raising interest rates this year.    The ONS said, data revisions aside, GDP in quarterly terms would reach or surpass its pre-coronavirus level in the October-December period of last year, as long as economic output does not fall by more than 0.2% in December. The ONS said architects, retailers, couriers and accountants had a bumper month in November and construction recovered from several weak months as raw materials became easier to source after problems in global supply chains. Britain's economy will still face challenges in the months ahead, even once coronavirus restrictions are relaxed. ""While the UK economy should rebound once Plan B measures are lifted, surging inflation and persistent supply chain disruption may mean that the UK's economic growth prospects remain under pressure for much of 2022,"" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said.

2022-01-17,"The final GDP (gross domestic product) readings for 2021 are only due next month. However, quarterly data does point to an economic rebound in Italy throughout the year.Now that Italy is about to choose a new president, there are question marks about whether this economic stability and performance could somehow be undermined. Italy experienced a massive economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic, but its prospects now look much rosier with economists praising the work of Prime Minister Mario Draghi for much of this new economic stability.""There is a boss and a sense of direction,"" Gilles Moec, group chief economist at AXA Investment Managers, told CNBC on Thursday.Draghi was sworn in as prime minister of Italy almost a year ago, in February 2021, to lead a government comprised of politicians from different parties, and some technocrats.His aim was to provide stability to the nation at a time when mainstream politicians could not agree on how to invest their EU recovery funds and mitigate the economic shock from the pandemic.And he has achieved it, according to economists.""In 2021, Italy did pretty well,"" Moec said.Though part of the growth was a ""mechanical catch up"" after the deep shock of 2020, there was also a ""genuine improvement,"" he added. The final GDP (gross domestic product) readings for 2021 are only due next month. But quarterly data does point to an economic rebound in Italy throughout last year.This is despite the appearance of the highly-infectious omicron variant, a new strain of Covid discovered in late November, which led to a subsequent tightening in social restrictions.""Notwithstanding a services deceleration, quarterly growth in [the fourth] quarter should have been sufficient to ensure an average GDP growth reading of 6.3% in 2021,"" Paolo Pizzoli, senior economist at ING, said in a research note Thursday, following the release of strong industrial production data. Economists say the available data does not yet fully reflect the improvements, as there is a certain time lag between policy implementation and economic impact.However, there are two main structural reforms and one key factor that have alleviated some of the economic pressures during Draghi's term so far, Guidogiorgio Bodrato, economist at Berenberg, told CNBC Thursday.He cited the judicial reform — approved in September and which could improve Italy's attractiveness to foreign investors — and changes to the public administration to speed up its efficiency.""He was instrumental in securing the recovery money from Europe,"" Bodrato also said about Draghi's work. Draghi's first main task as prime minister was to put together a plan on how the country would be using the EU's funds, which total 191.5 billion euros ($216.68 billion). The plans were then approved by European institutions. Disbursements of the funds could only have taken place after the completion of these key reforms.""Draghi's most important economic achievement has been the drafting of the [recovery] plan: a multi-year detailed commitment to investments and reforms which will have to be followed by any government from here until 2026,"" Luca Pennarola, European economist at BNP Paribas, said via email.""This means that whichever government comes into power in the next few years will have to follow Draghi's script in order to ensure access to the EU funds,"" he added. Now that Italy is about to choose a new president, with elections later this month, there are question marks about whether this economic stability and performance could somehow be undermined.This is because Draghi himself is among the candidates for the presidential job, which would open the door to a new prime minister and, potentially, to snap elections. The president's role is largely ceremonial in Italy while the real power lies with the prime minister.Despite the improvements, Italy is ""still in a complicated position,"" Moec said. He noted that with interest rates expected to go up this year, it could be increasingly more expensive for the Italian government to tap the markets to aid its recovery.This is a significant problem given that Italy has one of the highest debt piles in Europe.""The final judgement will be how fast they spend the money from the EU,"" Moec added.In addition, the current government has an expiration date in 2023 with new legislative elections due. So the question of who will replace Draghi, if not imminent in the wake of the presidential vote, will inevitably resurface again a couple of months down the line.In the meantime, there are already some signs of friction within the ruling government. This includes the lack of unanimity over the need to introduce compulsory vaccinations in Italy."

The urban unemployment rate in December matched the average for the year of 5.1%. The unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 24 remained far higher at 14.3%.""The better-than-expected GDP data doesn't change the big picture: China's economy is under multiple headwinds for now and a policy easing cycle is underway,"" Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said in a note.Hu pointed to how the People's Bank of China on Monday cut the borrowing cost of medium-term loans for the first time since April 2020. He expects the central bank to lower the benchmark loan prime rate on Jan. 20. China's zero-Covid policy aimed at controlling the pandemic prompted renewed travel restrictions within the country — including the lockdown of Xi'an city in central China in late December.In January, other cities were also locked down in full or partially, to control pockets of outbreaks tied to the highly transmissible omicron variant. Analysts have started to question whether the benefits of China's zero-Covid strategy outweigh the costs, given how contagious and potentially less fatal the omicron variant is.Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for China's 2022 GDP growth based on expectations the zero-Covid policy will cause increased restrictions on business activity. However, the analysts said the greatest impact would be on consumer spending.Retail sales dropped 3.9% in 2020 even though China's overall economy grew amid the pandemic. Consumer spending has since remained sluggish, partly as travel restrictions have kept a damper on tourism.In 2021, overall retail sales grew by 12.5% from the prior year's contraction, and also topped 2019 levels.However, only urban areas saw an increase in retail sales last year versus 2019 levels. Consumer spending in rural areas last year remained 1.8% below 2019 levels, according to CNBC analysis of Wind data.

What to know about the new investing landscape Business employees' incomes generally went up between 2020 and 2021, especially in labor-intensive industries like catering and manufacturing, Christine Peng, head of the Greater China consumer sector at UBS, said during a media call last week.But she noted that rising uncertainty has resulted in consumers delaying purchases of discretionary goods, such as new air conditioners. Peng said consumers were also thinking longer term, and that within households, female consumers were more willing to buy insurance or other financial management products.Within December's retail sales data, autos saw the greatest decline — down by 7.4% year-on-year —followed by a 6% drop in home appliances and a 3.1% decline in furniture. Sales of daily necessities saw the greatest increase last month, up 18.8% from a year ago.""The pandemic could continue to be a drag on the revival of consumer spending – although the situation in China remains relatively under control ... compared with other large economies,"" Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said in a statement. He expects consumption will remain under pressure in the first quarter.""We think China has the option to ease COVID restrictions, which could boost consumption and market confidence; but it would be highly unlikely for it to abandon the no-tolerance approach before the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Two Sessions [annual parliamentary meeting in March], in our view.""China's gross domestic product grew by 2.2% in 2020 from the prior year. That's according to the latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics, which in December released an annual data revision that reduced 2020 GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point.Compared with the initial release earlier in 2021, real estate, transport industries and accommodation and restaurants saw the greatest downward revision. Renting, leasing activities and business services saw the greatest increase, followed by manufacturing.Correction: This story was corrected to reflect that Goldman Sachs revised its 2022 forecast for China's GDP.

Here are the takeaways from the headlinesKevin Stankiewicz15 hours agoIn a document released last week, China's State Council, the country's top executive body, said ""core industries of the digital economy"" will account for 10% of its GDP by 2025, up from 7.8% in 2020.The targets are part of China's 14th Five Year Plan, a development blueprint that runs from 2021 to 2025. Last year, China highlighted areas of ""frontier technology"" for which it will boost research and aim for self-sufficiency in. The latest State Council document also gives more specific targets for the coming few years.For example, China is aiming for national online retail sales to rise from 11.76 trillion yuan in 2020 to 17 trillion yuan in 2025. It expects the software and information technology industry to rise from 8.16 trillion yuan in 2020 to 14 trillion yuan in 2025.China anticipates users of gigabit broadband, the current fastest internet connection speed, to increase from 6.4 million in 2020 to 60 million in 2025.In fact, boosting internet connections and speeds is part China's strategy to boost the digital economy's share of GDP. China will promote the commercial deployment and large-scale application of 5G, according to the plan. 5G relates to next-generation internet that promises super fast speeds. It has already started rolling out in China and other countries.But Beijing's plan also lays out ambitions in 6G or sixth-generation internet. China plans to increase support for 6G research and development and be involved in the creation of international standards for 6G. China began laying the foundations for work on 6G in 2019. Fifth generation has only just started rolling out and there are no agreed standards or definitions of what 6G is yet.The world's second-largest economy also aims to take a bigger role in shaping technology standards around the world, a move analysts said could have big implications for the power Beijing wields in areas from mobile internet to artificial intelligence. Standards are often globally agreed upon technical rules for how technologies work. China's plan also continues themes of self-sufficiency in areas like semiconductors. The document includes other areas like cloud computing, building data centers and cross-border e-commerce.Beijing also pledged to continue regulatory oversight on the domestic technology sector. Over the past year, China has tightened regulation for internet companies and brought in new laws in areas from antitrust to data protection.The State Council document said it would explore establishing governance methods that are compatible with the ""sustainable and healthy development of the digital economy."" Beijing also said it would clarify the responsibilities of various regulators and strengthen collaboration between different authorities."

Investors are betting the next big success story in gaming will come out of Turkey, even as the country endures a brutal economic crisis.Istanbul-based mobile game developer Dream Games has raised $255 million in a new round of funding, the company told CNBC. Investors now value the firm at $2.75 billion, almost triple the $1 billion it was worth just six months ago in its last series of fundraising.The cash injection was led by Index Ventures, which first backed the company in February 2021. Existing investors Makers Fund, IVP, Kora and Balderton Capital also participated in the round, while BlackRock joined as a new investor.Mobile gaming — and tech more broadly — is proving to be a bright spot in an otherwise hellish economic landscape in Turkey.Turks have faced soaring prices amid a plunge in the value of the lira — the currency has fallen more than 40% against the U.S. dollar in the past year.Some of this decline was fueled by geopolitical tensions, in addition to Turkey's excessive trade deficit and mounting debts. But investors say the situation was exacerbated by an unorthodox monetary policy, with the central bank cutting interest rates aggressively at the behest of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Dream Games was founded in 2019 by former executives at Peak Games, another mobile gaming start-up which was acquired by Zynga for $1.8 billion. Zynga later agreed to be taken over by Take-Two Interactive in a $12.7 billion deal.Turkey is now home to some of the most valuable tech start-ups in the world, with e-commerce firm Trendyol valued at $16.5 billion and online grocery start-up Getir worth $7.7 billion.Soner Aydemir, Dream Games' co-founder and CEO, has built a business even more valuable than his previous venture. He says the success of Peak Games and other Turkish companies has helped drive investor interest in the country's burgeoning tech industry.""In Turkey, we have thousands of talented young people,"" Aydemir told CNBC in an interview. ""Mobile gaming gives them the opportunity to reach a global audience for the first time."" In a similar vein, Getir has been expanding its reach beyond Turkey into other markets such as the U.K. and America.Aydemir said Dream Games is less affected by volatility in the local currency as ""99% of our revenue comes from outside Turkey."" The company also looks after its employees, he added, offering ""competitive"" salaries compared to other firms.""There's at least one digital company in Turkey which is worth more than $10 billion, so it's obviously been a source of great talent for a long time,"" Stephane Kurgan, the partner at Index Ventures who led the investment in Dream Games, told CNBC. Dream Games released its first title, a puzzle game called Royal Match, in March last year.The game sees players match up tiles of varying colors until they get enough points to progress to the next level, similar to Activision-owned King's Candy Crush Saga and Peak Games' Toon Blast, which Aydemir had worked on before leaving the firm.Royal Match recently broke into the top five highest-grossing mobile games on Apple's App Store in the U.S., according to data from App Annie. It's now played by 13 million people each month and generates around $31 million in monthly net revenues after Apple and Google take their cut of in-app transactions.Looking ahead, Dream Games plans to continue developing Royal Match and begin work on a new title later this year.""We should expand our audience,"" Aydemir said. ""To do that we should create multiple titles.""The Dream Games founder says he takes a lot of inspiration from Disney's Pixar animation studio. ""We are not like a typical gaming company focusing on the gaming audience,"" he said. ""We are targeting almost everyone in the world.""""Virality and monetization"" are key to building a mobile gaming company, Index Ventures' Kurgan told CNBC. Kurgan was previously chief operating officer at King.Take-Two Interactive's almost $13 billion purchase of Zynga ""highlights the growth of mobile gaming,"" he added. Mobile is the fastest-growing segment of the $180 billion video game industry, accounting for more than 50% of the entire market.It's not the first time Index has made a big bet on gaming. The firm has also invested in the likes of Roblox, King and Supercell, which is now owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent."

""Given the strength of our economy and pace of recent price increases, it's appropriate — as Fed Chairman Powell has indicated — to recalibrate the support that is now necessary.""While Biden's comments were brief and supportive, they were notable given that the Fed is empowered to maximize employment and tame prices as a nonpartisan body.Former President Donald Trump skirted historical precedent when he repeatedly and publicly berated the Fed's decision-making and past efforts to make it tougher to borrow. Trump's barbs were often personal and tended to ridicule Powell as Fed chief. Trump in 2017 nominated Powell, a Republican, to lead the Fed.Biden nominated Powell for a second term late last year, a move motivated in part by the Fed chief's efforts to support American business and the financial sector during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.The central bank has telegraphed for months that it will soon raise interest rates and has already begun to cut the quantity of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities it buys each month to support the U.S. economy. The moves are designed to make borrowing more expensive for American businesses and curb corporations' appetite for debt.The Biden administration and the Fed have both come under pressure from upset voters in recent months amid a spike in inflation and increased costs for goods as diverse as meat and used cars.The Labor Department's latest inflation report showed that U.S. consumers paid 7% more for all goods and services in December than they did 12 months prior. The figure represented the fastest year-over-year price increase since 1982.

2022-01-19,"Microsoft's planned $68.7 billion acquisition of gaming company Activision Blizzard isn't just a weapon in the tech giant's battle for video game domination.It's also about the metaverse — a buzzy topic at the moment, with brands from Disney to Walmart working to carve out their own niche in the digital space, which promises virtual worlds where people can eventually explore, work and play.Gaming appears to be a particularly large part of Microsoft's metaverse plans. In a press release on Tuesday, the company wrote that buying the ""Call of Duty"" and ""Warcraft"" maker ""will provide building blocks for the metaverse."" Later in that press release, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was quoted as saying that gaming ""will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms.""The move may have been a long time coming. Corporate metaverse interest seemingly exploded after Facebook, now called Meta, changed its name to reflect its bet on a virtually focused future. But Microsoft and Nadella were talking publicly about the idea's potential even before Mark Zuckerberg — and acquiring companies with large gaming communities to give them a leg up.In 2020, Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for ZeniMax Media, the parent company of gaming studio Bethesda. And back in 2014, the tech giant paid $2.5 billion for Mojang, the maker of ""Minecraft.""""As the virtual and physical worlds converge, the metaverse…is emerging as a first-class platform,"" Nadella said in April 2021 during a quarterly earnings call. Microsoft's gaming communities, like ""Minecraft"" and its then-140 million monthly users, could grow into huge commercial marketplaces ""as games evolve into metaverse economies,"" he added.That earnings call came about three months before Zuckerberg first revealed his plans for Facebook and the metaverse, teasing the company's eventual transformation into Meta in October. At Microsoft's Ignite 2021 conference in November, Nadella compared the promise of the metaverse to the way the tech world looked at the nascent internet in the 1990s.""When we talk about the metaverse, we're describing both a new platform and a new application type, similar to how we talked about the web and websites in the early '90s,"" Nadella said in a keynote address at the conference. ""It's no longer just playing a game with friends. You can be in the game with them.""Microsoft does not yet offer the sort of commercial virtual reality headset that would be needed for such an immersive gaming experience. But in June, Nadella described the economic impact that metaverse gaming can already provide: During a conversation with Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft-owned Xbox, Nadella noted that the creators of tens of thousands of ""Minecraft"" game modifications have collectively pulled in more than $350 million, by building new landscapes for other players to explore.""They're creating entire college campuses on 'Minecraft,'"" Nadella said. Microsoft also profits off communities of gamers making in-game purchases, he noted.A market report last year estimated that in-game purchases could top $34 billion in revenue in 2021. The Activision deal could help increase Microsoft's cut: It includes Candy Crush Saga, one of the world's most popular mobile games, which is estimated to pull in more than $1 billion per year from in-app purchases.Of course, Microsoft's metaverse bets aren't limited to gaming. The company launched a Mesh cloud collaboration service for virtual 3D business meetings last year, which Microsoft said ""can serve as a gateway to the metaverse.""And at Microsoft's Build conference in May 2021, Nadella's keynote address delved into what he describes as the ""enterprise metaverse,"" where companies can use Microsoft's business software products to monitor their supply chains in the metaverse, building ""a complete digital twin"" to their real-world infrastructure to better track products from the manufacturing stage to delivery.But Tuesday's agreement to buy Activision shows that Microsoft could view gaming as a way to compete with Meta and any other metaverse giants going forward. Indeed, Nadella has already hinted at the idea of multiple metaverses just under the umbrella of Microsoft's gaming divisions.""If you take 'Halo' as a game, it is a metaverse. 'Minecraft' is a metaverse, and so is 'Flight Sim,'"" Nadella told Bloomberg in November. ""In some sense, they're 2D today, and the question is: 'Can you now take that to a full 3D world?' And we absolutely plan to do so.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Bill Gates says the metaverse will host most of your office meetings within 'two or three years'This 29-year-old book predicted the 'metaverse' — and some of Facebook's plans are eerily similar"

""Over the last two years, its rather complete industrial system has allowed China to play the role of 'production of last resort' for the rest of the world when the ensuing spread of the Covid-19 to the rest of the world has caused economic paralysis in both developed and developing economies.""However, omicron's high transmissibility means the costs of the zero-Covid policy are rising, while benefits are falling, Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu said in a report earlier this month.So far, the policy has affected consumers more than factories."

So China's economic recovery has largely been dependent upon on return to its old export driven model, while consumption has really lagged,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Thursday.""In 2020, for example, net exports contributed the largest share of Chinese GDP growth since 1997 and consumption is not even recovered yet to its pre-Covid trend, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics,"" Bekink said.Despite global disruptions of supply chains during the pandemic, China's trade surplus rose to $676.43 billion in 2021— up from $523.99 billion in 2020, and the highest on record going back to 1950, according to official data from Wind information.""Exports will still continue to be a very important growth driver for the Chinese economy in 2022,"" Zerlina Zeng, a senior credit analyst at CreditSights, told CNBC on Wednesday. On Thursday, China's central bank cut its benchmark lending rates again amid rising concerns of slowdown in the economy, and reduced the one-year loan prime rate as well as the five-year LPR. Loan prime rates affect the lending rates for corporate and household loans in the country.The world's second largest economy grew 8.1% in 2021 as industrial production rose steadily through the end of the year, according to official data from China's National Bureau of Statistics released Monday. GDP in the fourth quarter rose 4% from a year ago, faster than analysts expected.""China's economy is almost running on two tracks. The export-based economy actually is fine, but the domestic economy is quite soft,"" Steve Cochrane, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Wednesday. Still, domestic demand will continue to be a drag on the economy due to China's zero-Covid policy, which has prompted multiple travel restrictions within the country including the lockdown of Xi'an city in late December.Official data from Monday showed that retail sales missed expectations and grew by 1.7% in December from a year ago. ""Given the zero-Covid policy and the difficulty in terms of traveling tourism, even spending over the upcoming holiday season is going to be quite weak,"" Cochrane added. The Lunar New Year — which starts in early February this year — is China's biggest holiday season, with millions of people crisscrossing the country to join loved ones for the Spring festivities.With consumer sentiment uncertain and hiring still soft, China is expected to continue its policy easing measures to boost the domestic economy.""This is why the PBOC has been front loading on monetary policy easing, including policy rate cuts well as net injection of medium to long-term liquidity,"" said Zeng, referring to the People's Bank of China's recent surprise move to cut its loan rates.

The International Monetary Fund's managing director said Friday that China's zero-Covid policy is increasingly looking like a ""burden,"" which is impinging economic recovery both domestically and for the world at large.Speaking to CNBC's Geoff Cutmore via videoconference at The Davos Agenda virtual event, Kristalina Georgieva said the containment strategy, though initially successful, was now presenting more risks than benefits.Zero-Covid refers to attempts to completely eliminate the virus via public health measures such as lockdowns, mass testing, and border quarantine.""The zero-Covid policy, for quite some time, did contain infections in China,"" said Georgieva, adding that the new highly transmissible omicron variant meant that these containment measures cannot now be easily achieved.""The restrictions that need to be imposed are more of a burden to the economy, put more at risk not [for] only China but also China as a supply source for the rest of the world,"" she said. Two years into the pandemic and with the emergence of the omicron variant, Georgieva noted that it is now important for all countries to reassess the best way to deal with the pandemic. In China's case, it may soon be untenable to contain the latest wave without severe economic implications, she said.""What omicron is teaching all of us is that a highly transmissible variant of Covid may be much more difficult to contain without a dramatic impact on the economy,"" said Georgieva.Already, China has been moving to boost its economy amid slowing growth. On Wednesday, the country's central bank, the People's Bank of China, cut its benchmark lending rates, lowering corporate and household loans. Georgieva noted that further measures could be expected as a ""pandemic policy"" remains a top economic policy for China and the rest of the world throughout 2022.""Unless we build protections around the globe, we are going to continue to see disruptions and the future would not be as bright as we want it to be,"" Georgieva said.On Thursday, China's mainland health commission reported a total of 73 new confirmed cases. It has a seven-day average of 129 cases."
2022-01-21,"During a recent panel discussion, industry figures with experience of both policy and the corporate world reflected on the outcome of COP26 and how things could progress moving forward.The panelists also touched upon the subject of net-zero pledges from major businesses.While net-zero commitments draw attention, actually achieving these goals is a huge task with significant financial and logistical hurdles. The COP26 climate summit, held in the Scottish city of Glasgow last year, made headlines around the world.After days of painstaking and at times fraught negotiations, countries agreed upon a deal which sought to build on 2015′s Paris Agreement and curb the worst effects of climate change.Things weren't all plain sailing, however. The Glasgow Climate Pact, as it's known, faced stumbling blocks related to the phasing out of coal, fossil fuel subsidies and financial support to low-income countries.India and China, both among the world's biggest burners of coal, insisted on a last-minute change of fossil fuel language in the pact — from a ""phase out"" of coal to a ""phase down."" After initial objections, opposing countries ultimately conceded.During a recent panel discussion chaired by CNBC's Steve Sedgwick, industry figures with experience of both policy and the corporate world reflected on the summit's outcome and how things could progress moving forward.""A lot more was expected, but what was delivered was really spectacular,"" Jos Delbeke, who is the former director-general for climate action at the European Commission, said.Delbeke, who also holds the position of European Investment Bank climate chair at the European University Institute, went on to say that major oil and gas producers were now ""on board"" alongside corporations, cities and regional authorities.""We have seen lots of commitments, so that's basically the good news,"" he said.""It is not yet the one and a half degrees Celsius, as scientists are telling us we should get … but it is a major change,"" he said. The 1.5 degrees that Delbeke references relates to the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting global warming ""to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.""Hitting that target will be no mean feat. On Monday, the U.N. secretary general struck a sobering tone in a speech to the World Economic Forum. ""Emissions must fall, but they continue to rise,"" António Guterres said. ""Coal-fired power generation is surging towards a new all-time record.""""And even if all developed countries kept their promise, very important promise, to drastically reduce emissions by 2030,"" he continued, ""the problem is that with all developing countries achieving their present Nationally Determined Contribution, especially emerging economies, global emissions would still be too high to keep [the] 1.5 degrees goal within reach.""In simple terms, NDCs refer to individual countries' targets for cutting emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change. According to the United Nations, the Glasgow Climate Pact ""calls on all countries to present stronger national action plans next year [2022], instead of in 2025, which was the original timeline.""

This global stock with 55% upside offers uranium price exposure, BoA says While the outcome of negotiations at COP26 left many frustrated, a number of high-profile pledges and announcements were made during the summit.A joint declaration between the United States and China, for example, in which the two superpowers said they would work together on a number of climate-related actions, took many by surprise.Elsewhere, signatories to another declaration at the summit said they would ""work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets.""  And on Nov. 3, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero said more than $130 trillion of private capital had been ""committed to transforming the economy for net zero."" Also speaking on CNBC's panel last week was Judy Kuszewski, chief executive of Sancroft International, a sustainability consultancy.""We very rarely ask the business community or individual businesses to make promises towards a goal where the path to get there may not be entirely clear,"" she said. ""This is actually a very rare exception and the fact that there have been quite a few early adopters of net-zero pledges and targets towards meeting those net-zero pledges — they've been especially bold to take that kind of slight leap into the unknown.""Over the past few years, a wide range of high-profile businesses — including major oil and gas firms — have made net-zero pledges.Initiatives such as Amazon's Climate Pledge also exist. Its signatories — who include Microsoft, Uber and Unilever — have committed to what the Pledge calls ""net zero carbon"" by the year 2040.According to the Climate Pledge website, firms that have signed up to it have agreed to, among other things, regular reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, carbon elimination and ""credible offsets."" While net-zero commitments draw attention, actually achieving them is a huge task with significant financial and logistical hurdles. The devil is in the detail and ambitions and goals can often be light on the latter.Referencing the Glasgow climate summit, Sancroft International's Kuszewski said it was clear that the business community had been ""visible and active in a way that it had not previously been in earlier COPs.""  ""We see a lot of action from business in calling for a level playing field, for bold commitments and for a framework that they know they can operate within.""

Brazil's economic minister warned Friday that Western central bankers are ""sleeping at the driving wheel"" as economies slip deeper into a high inflation environment.Speaking to CNBC's Geoff Cutmore via videoconference at The Davos Agenda virtual event, Paulo Guedes said that the inflation ""beast"" is already loose and set to become a real problem.""My fear is that the beast is out of the bottle,"" Guedes told the panel.""I think the central banks are sleeping at the driving wheel. They should be aware, and I think inflation will be a problem, a real problem very soon for the Western world,"" he said. Far from being transitory as some central bankers have suggested, Guedes said that inflation could be a long-term issue for Western governments, who have left themselves little room for maneuver.""I don't think inflation will be transitory at all,"" he said. ""I think these supply adverse shocks will fade away gradually, but there's no arbitrage anymore to be exploited by the Western sides."" Brazil, for its part, moved early to stem the worst inflationary pressures by winding down its Covid stimulus packages last year, Guedes said.Brazil's economy briefly returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021 before slipping lower again.""We took advantage of the recovery to remove, gradually, the monetary and fiscal [stimulus],"" Guedes said, adding that the government has room to react should another coronavirus wave emerge.Guedes' comments contrast with those central bankers who argue that current levels of inflation are, indeed, transitory and containable. Also speaking at The Davos Agenda Friday, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said inflation in the euro area was unlikely to worsen dramatically, arguing that the recent surge was due to short-term pressures such as supply bottlenecks and energy prices.Meantime, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is widely expected to hike interest rates at the central bank's next meeting in a bid to stem rising inflation. It follows similar moves by the Bank of England in December."

Interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks are likely to worsen a global debt crisis, particularly for developing countries, according to a new report from U.K. non-profit the Jubilee Debt Campaign.The Federal Open Market Committee meets this week to decide the path for its tightening of monetary policy as it looks to contain soaring inflation. Some analysts are expecting the central bank to hike rates four times from their pandemic-era lows in 2022.In a report published Sunday, the Jubilee Debt Campaign highlighted that developing countries' debt payments rose 120% between 2010 and 2021, and are currently at their highest since 2001. The average portion of government revenues channeled toward external debt payments increased from 6.8% in 2010 to 14.3% in 2021, with payments shooting up in 2020. The sharp increase in debt payments is hindering countries' economic recovery from the pandemic, the report suggested, and rising U.S. and global interest rates in 2022 could exacerbate the problem for many lower income countries.Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last week that Fed rate hikes could ""throw cold water"" on already weak recoveries in certain countries. Higher U.S. interest rates, and thus a rise in the greenback, could make it more expensive for countries to meet their dollar-denominated debt obligations.""The debt crisis continues to engulf lower income countries, with no end in sight unless there is urgent action on debt relief,"" said Heidi Chow, executive director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign.""The debt crisis has already stripped countries of the resources needed to tackle the climate emergency and the continued disruption from Covid, while rising interest rates threaten to sink countries in even more debt.""Chow called on G-20 leaders to stop ""burying their heads in the sand"" and argued that the global economy urgently needs a ""comprehensive debt cancellation scheme which compels private lenders to take part in debt relief."" The organization's debt data portal indicated that 54 countries around the world are currently facing debt crises, insofar as debt payments are hampering governments' ability to preserve citizens' economic and social rights.A further 14 countries are at risk of both public and private debt crisis, while 22 are in danger of a solely private sector debt crisis and 21 a public sector crisis.Of all external debt payments owed in 2022 by low and lower middle-income governments, 47% are to private lenders, 27% multilateral institutions, 12% China and 14% other governments, according to JDC figures.In a tweet last week, World Bank President David Malpass called for urgent debt relief, enhanced debt transparency and a rebalancing of creditor and debtor powers. The G-20 created the Common Framework in 2020, intended to aid countries facing insolvency and protracted liquidity problems.However, none of the countries admitted to the framework have yet had any debt canceled. The African Forum and Network on Debt and Development (AFRODAD) has long warned that many African countries were facing a debt precipice, and Zambia in November 2020 became the continent's first pandemic-era default.""Covid-19 accelerated an already deteriorating situation and will reverse the socio-economic gains of the past decade,"" said Jason Braganza, executive director of AFRODAD.""We have consistently said the current debt relief measures aren't good enough and have called for a truly inclusive debt relief program with all creditors; and a comprehensive debt cancellation program."""
2022-01-24,"Although commodity prices have soared so far in 2022, with Brent crude on Wednesday notching its highest price since October 2014, commodity-based currencies have been relatively subdued.BMO Capital Markets European Head of FX Strategy Stephen Gallo suggested that ripple effects from China could be feeding into the performance of developed market commodity-based currencies. China's zero-Covid policy and broader economic circumstances could be weighing on currencies that should be reaping the benefits of higher commodity prices, strategists at BMO Capital Markets have suggested.Although commodity prices have soared so far in 2022, with Brent crude on Wednesday notching its highest price since October 2014, commodity-based currencies such as the Norwegian krone and Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars have been relatively subdued.related investing newsHere are 3 reasons to buy gold, according to UBSFred Imbert16 hours agoAs at Friday morning in Europe, the Aussie dollar was down 0.9% and the kiwi by 1.45% against the greenback year-to-date. The Canadian dollar was also down 0.9% year-to-date, while the U.S. dollar had gained 0.55% against the Norwegian krone.""What we would typically expect to see is the New Zealand dollar rallying alongside agricultural commodity prices and Aussie rallying alongside base metals, but thus far this year, Aussie and Kiwi are both down — get this — against the euro and the yen,"" Greg Anderson, BMO's global head of FX strategy, said in a podcast last week.Anderson noted that the central banks in these commodity-driven economies have been less hawkish than the U.S. Federal Reserve so far this year, but suggested this only provides a partial explanation for this divergence between commodity prices and commodity currencies. He highlighted that the two-year swap rates — a type of derivative that's a key barometer for currency strategists — for Aussie and kiwi dollars had underperformed the U.S. dollar, which would lend weight to the hypothesis that central bank policy divergence is a factor.However, the Canadian swap rate has performed very similarly to the United States, so this does not explain why CAD has not rallied alongside oil, Anderson argued, adding that a further mystery is how the AUD and NZD are losing ground against the euro and the yen, when the swap rates for both are roughly flat.Chinese demandEuropean Head of FX Strategy Stephen Gallo suggested that ripple effects from China could be feeding into the performance of developed market commodity-based currencies.""We know China is implementing its zero-Covid strategy. That has implications for both supply and demand, but it could conceivably be eating into China's demand for certain raw materials,"" Gallo said.""We know there were power cuts and factory closures late last year, the property market is clearly in a slowdown phase, and we also know policymakers are not adding huge amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus, even though they've adopted an easing bias."" Gallo noted that international trade data out of China shows evidence of slower nominal growth rates of certain commodity imports, while import growth has been more subdued than export growth.""Is that growth backdrop in China transmitting through to commodity-based currencies? Yep, possibly it is. Might China's economic backdrop contribute to a deceleration in global inflation pressures later this year? Possibly, but we don't know for sure,"" he added.Shifting sandsOver the medium term, Gallo suggested that the Chinese government's Made in China 2025 initiative, which aims to reduce China's reliance on foreign tech imports and invest heavily in domestic innovation, could permanently alter the way that Chinese demand influences global currencies.However, it is difficult to pinpoint the extent to which the implementation of that policy is factored into present price fluctuations, he noted.""Perhaps the Chinese economic backdrop is only having a partial effect on commodity prices because we are seeing excess demand in other parts of the world helped by very loose monetary policy and, more importantly, very loose fiscal policy,"" Gallo said.""Maybe there is also an element of the green transition embedded in energy prices and base metals too. Perhaps the equilibrium prices of certain commodities are simply changing.""Anderson suggested that the equilibrium pricing in many commodities will become ""semi-permanently higher"" through the green transition's shift in demand, particularly in the likes of base metals, which he said will benefit metals-reliant currencies like the South African rand and Chilean peso.'Buy the dip'In terms of current trades, Anderson recommended that investors look to ""buy the dip"" in the AUD-JPY currency pair.""From both a commodity price and an interest rate differential perspective, the pair should have rallied, but it hasn't. I would still be looking to position for a move back up to 86 or so by mid-year in Aussie-yen,"" he said.Meanwhile, Gallo suggested backing the euro to move lower against the Canadian dollar, a trade he said was supported by three key factors. ""Firstly, you have got higher oil prices, which compound the impact of the increase in natural gas prices. Secondly, net trade. The euro area recorded its first merchandise trade deficit with the rest of the world last November in almost a decade,"" he said.The third support beam is the expectation that the divergence in monetary policy between the extra-dovish European Central Bank and slightly more hawkish Bank of Canada could have further to run.""I don't think there's a huge amount, given what's already priced in for the Bank of Canada, but I think there's still a bit more left. I think euro-CAD can take a stab at the high 1.30s before the cycle ends,"" he added."
2022-01-24,"Mainland China's share of the global luxury market rose in 2021 as consumers spent more at home, keeping the country on track to become the world's largest luxury goods market by 2025, according to consultancy Bain & Company. However, luxury goods sales were not immune to a slump in Chinese consumer spending in the second half of last year, and Chinese consumer spending on luxury goods worldwide last year remained below pre-pandemic levels, the report said.The Bain analysts expect the growth of mainland China's luxury market to moderate in 2022. BEIJING — Chinese consumers are spending more on luxury goods at home, even if they can't easily travel abroad due to pandemic-related restrictions, consultancy Bain & Company said in its annual report on the luxury sector.Sales of personal luxury goods in mainland China rose by 36% to 471 billion yuan ($73.59 billion) in 2021 from the prior year, according to Bain estimates released Thursday. That's more than double the 234 billion yuan in luxury goods spending on the mainland in 2019, before the pandemic.The growth in luxury goods sales comes despite a slump in Chinese retail sales overall since the pandemic began in 2020. The data also reflects the growth of China's domestic market as a destination for international brands.Mainland China's share of the global luxury market rose to about 21% in 2021, up from roughly 20% in 2020, according to Bain.""We anticipate this growth to continue, putting the country on track to become the world's largest luxury goods market by 2025 — regardless of future international travel patterns,"" the report said.""China remains the best consumer story in the world,"" the Bain analysts said, pointing to the country's growing middle class. ""The average increase of disposable income remains higher than inflation.""Leather goods sales grew by about 60% and was the fastest-growing category, followed by roughly 40% growth in fashion and lifestyle, the report said. A major driver for the local luxury market is the growth of duty-free stores in Hainan, an island province in southern China. In the last two years, new government policies have cut taxes and introduced other business-friendly measures aimed at turning the region into a free-trade port and international consumption center.Even before pandemic-induced travel restrictions kept shoppers from traveling overseas, luxury brands were already moving to Hainan and other parts of mainland China from Hong Kong due to violent protests in the semi-autonomous region.Sales of luxury goods at Hainan's duty-free stores posted annual growth of 85% in 2021 — reaching 60 billion yuan — following a 122% year-on-year increase in 2020, according to Bain. The stores accounted for 13% of mainland China's personal luxury goods market last year, up from 9% in 2020 and 6% in prior years.However, the Bain analysts said the biggest driver of Hainan's duty-free success was sharp discounts that went beyond tax savings. The ""significant price gap"" between the official listed price and that in Hainan contributed to slow growth in other sales channels, at least for some products, the report said. Analysts at The Economist Intelligence Unit expect new government policies to help China's domestic duty-free market to nearly quadruple to 258 billion yuan between 2021 and 2025, with the opening of new duty-free stores in major Chinese cities like Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.But that's contingent on Chinese authorities relaxing restrictions on international travel and duty-free purchase quotas, the analysts said in a report late last month.""The duty-free market in Hainan is still lagging behind on product ranges and price competitiveness, especially for mid-to-high-end products,"" they said. ""Meanwhile, Chinese consumers may prefer to combine their shopping with an overseas holiday, to experience foreign cultures and environments."" Global spending on luxury goods reached 283 billion euros ($320.6 billion) in 2021, recovering from a slump in 2020 to exceed 2019 levels of 281 billion euros in luxury sales, according to Bain estimates.However, Chinese consumers still spent about 30 billion euros less on luxury goods last year than they did in 2019, the report showed.Robust luxury goods sales growth slowed sharply in the second half of last year, the analysts said, pointing to factors such as a high comparable base in 2020, sporadic Covid outbreaks and new regulations on online influencers.

The updated outlook also removed President Biden's signature Build Back Better fiscal policy package from its baseline projection after failure to pass the original bill.China, meanwhile, is predicted to grow 4.8% this year, down 0.8 percentage points from earlier estimates amid disruptions caused by its zero-Covid policy, as well as ""projected financial stress"" among its property developers. Elsewhere, still surging Covid cases coupled with rising inflation and higher energy prices weighed on growth estimates globally, most notably in Brazil, Canada and Mexico.The IMF said higher inflation is set to persist for longer than previously anticipated, but added that it should ease later this year, ""as supply-demand imbalances wane in 2022 and monetary policy in major economies responds.""Looking ahead, the report upgraded its 2023 growth forecast by 0.2 percentage points to 3.8%. However, it warned that the estimate precluded the emergence of a new Covid variant, and said any pickup would be dependent on equitable global access to vaccines and health care.""The forecast is conditional on adverse health outcomes declining to low levels in most countries by end-2022, assuming vaccination rates improve worldwide and therapies become more effective,"" it said.""The emphasis on an effective global health strategy is more salient than ever,"" it added."
2022-01-25,"Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary policy settings on Tuesday in an out-of-cycle move, as global supply constraints and brisk economic demand elevate inflation pressures across the region.The city-state's trade-dependent economy is highly susceptible to swings in global inflation and the central bank's sudden move comes as price pressures create unease for policymakers elsewhere in Asia.The MAS said it would raise slightly the rate of appreciation of its policy band. The width of the policy band and the level at which it is centered will be unchanged. Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary policy settings on Tuesday in an out-of-cycle move, as global supply constraints and brisk economic demand elevate inflation pressures across the region.The city-state's trade-dependent economy is highly susceptible to swings in global inflation and the central bank's sudden move comes as price pressures create unease for policymakers elsewhere in Asia.Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC, said she expects the central bank to tighten again in April, describing Tuesday's move as only a ""slight tightening.""""If they had announced a more aggressive tightening today, then that would have dampened expectations for April,"" she said.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which manages monetary policy through exchange rate settings, said it would slightly raise the rate of appreciation of its policy band.The width of the band, known as the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate, or S$NEER, and the level at which it is centered will be unchanged.The MAS last surprised with an off-cycle move in January 2015 when it eased its policy after a collapse in global oil prices.Other economies are also taking tightening steps.Last week, Indonesia's central bank surprised markets with 300 basis points of staggered hikes in the reserve requirement ratio for banks over the next eight months.Singapore's move comes just a day after data showed prices in the city-state climbed in December by the fastest pace in nearly eight years.""This move builds on the pre-emptive shift to an appreciating stance in October 2021 and is appropriate for ensuring medium-term price stability,"" the MAS said, referring to its tightening move late last year.

Singapore's bellwether economy is expected to grow 3-5%, unchanged from earlier forecasts.""2022 will be year of double tightening for Singapore - both fiscal and monetary levers will grind tighter,"" said OCBC's Ling.The MAS expects core inflation to be 2.0-3.0% this year, from the 1.0-2.0% expected in October. Headline inflation is expected to be 2.5-3.5%, from the earlier forecast range of 1.5-2.5%.""While core inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year from the elevated levels in the first half as supply constraints ease, the risks remain skewed to the upside,"" the MAS said.Singapore will release its annual budget on Feb. 18, when the government is expected to announce the timing for an anticipated hike in goods and services tax.The city-state's economy grew 7.2% in 2021, its fastest pace in over a decade, rebounding from a record 5.4% contraction in 2020. The government has spent more than S$100 billion over the last two years to cushion its economy from the impact of the pandemic.Instead of interest rates, the MAS manages policy by letting the local dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed band.It adjusts its policy via three levers: the slope, mid-point and width of the policy band."
2022-01-25," The Federal Reserve will hike rates in March and at least two more times this year, the CNBC Fed Survey predicts.The central bank will begin shrinking its balance sheet in June, survey respondents expect.At the Fed's two-day meeting, which ends Wednesday, it is expected to give more clues as to when it will hike rates and begin shrinking the balance sheet. The CNBC Fed Survey shows market expectations have turned aggressive for Federal Reserve policy tightening this year and next, with respondents looking for multiple rate hikes and significant balance sheet reduction.The first hike is now firmly seen coming in March, compared with a June expectation in the December survey. Respondents expect 3.5 rate hikes this year, showing that three are agreed but there is debate over whether there's a fourth. Half of the 36 respondents see two or three hikes this year, and half see four or five. An additional three hikes are expected next year. That makes the forecast for a funds rate of just over 1% this year, compared to around zero now, 1.8% in 2023 and a terminal rate, or the end-point of the hiking cycle, at 2.4% reached in March 2024.""The Fed has pivoted from patient to panicked on inflation in record time,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, wrote in response to the survey. ""That ups the risk of a misstep in policy, especially in light of the complexity of inflation dynamics today.""At the central bank's two-day meeting, which ends Wednesday, it is expected to give more clues as to when it will hike rates and begin shrinking the balance sheet. Chairman Jerome Powell will also address the media. The balance sheet runoff is seen beginning in July, much earlier than the last survey, which pegged the beginning in November. While the Fed has yet to formulate a plan for balance sheet runoff, here is a first look at how respondents believe it could happen: $380 billion to come off the $9 trillion balance sheet this year and $860 billion in 2023.Monthly runoff pace of $73 billion eventually, far faster than the last runoff in 2018, but the Fed will phase in this monthly pace.$2.8 trillion in total runoff or about a third of the balance sheet over 3 years.Most support the Fed reducing the mortgage portfolio before Treasurys, letting short-term Treasurys run off before long-term ones and only reducing the balance sheet by not replacing securities that mature, rather than outright asset sales. ""Investors are under-appreciating risk in the financial system,"" said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel Nicolaus. ""The wave of liquidity and the zero-interest policy have distorted all markets. The Federal Reserve should have shifted policy a year ago.""In the survey, 91% of respondents say the Fed is significantly or somewhat late in addressing inflation.""The Fed should start by raising rates aggressively, that is, 50 bps initially, so it can throttle back later when/if supply chain issues start resolving themselves and inflation comes down as a result,"" Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economics LLC, wrote in response to the survey.Respondents marked down their outlook for stocks but only modestly compared with how much they boosted their outlook for Fed rate hikes. The S&P 500 is seen ending the year at 4,658, or a 5.6% increase from the Monday close. That's down from the December forecast of 4,752. The S&P is forecast to rise to 4,889 in 2023.The CNBC Risk-Reward ratio, which gauges the probability of a 10% increase or decline in stocks over the next six months, fell to -14 from -11 in the last survey. There is an average 52% probability of a 10% decline in the next six months, compared with just a 38% probability of a 10% gain.With an increase in the outlook for Fed tightening and the recent Covid omicron wave, respondents' economic forecasts have come down. The forecast for GDP fell to 3.5% for this year, down from 3.9% in the December outlook, and 2.7% for 2023, down from 2.9%. The average CPI forecast was raised by about 0.4 percentage points this year to 4.4% and to 3.2% next year.The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 3.6% this year, compared with the current rate of 3.9%. The chance of recession seen in the next year rose to 23% from 19% but remains about average. Inflation is seen as the No. 1 threat to the expansion, and 51% believe the Fed will have to raise rates above neutral to slow the economy.""Assuming the pandemic continues to recede — each new wave of the virus is less disruptive than the previous one — the economy will be at full employment and inflation near the Fed's target by this time next year,"" wrote Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.Correction: Due to an error in a response to the survey, an earlier version of this story reported that respondents' GDP forecasts rose for 2022 and 2023. They actually declined to 3.5% from 3.9% in the December survey for 2023 and to 2.7% from 2.9% for 2023."
2022-01-26,"The Federal Reserve's move to raise interest rates and tighten policy aggressively will hamper the economic recovery in Asia, according to the International Monetary Fund.The Fed's higher interest rates ""may not cause a big shock to the financial market, but they can definitely slow down Asia's recovery and growth,"" Changyong Rhee, director of the Asia and Pacific department at IMF, told CNBC on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve's move to raise interest rates and tighten policy aggressively will hamper the economic recovery in Asia, according to the International Monetary Fund.The current account surplus and the level of reserves are much higher among Asian countries this time compared to 2013 during the so-called ""taper tantrum,"" said Changyong Rhee, director of the Asia and Pacific department at the IMF.However, he warned the higher debt burden is a problem for the region.""Overall, the debt has increased quite significantly after the global financial crisis. Around 2007, Asia accounted for about 27% of the global debt. Now in 2021, Asia accounted for  almost 40% of global debt,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Wednesday.In 2013, the Fed triggered a ""taper tantrum"" when it began to wind down its asset purchase program. Investors panicked and it sparked a sell-off in bonds, causing Treasury yields to surge.As a result, emerging markets in Asia suffered sharp capital outflows and currency depreciation at that time, forcing central banks in the region to hike interest rates to protect their capital accounts.This time, the Fed's higher interest rates ""may not cause a big shock to the financial market, but they can definitely slow down Asia's recovery and growth,"" Rhee added.His comments come ahead of the Fed's policy statement later on Wednesday, where it's expected to signal a rate hike as soon as March and indicate more policy tightening on the table to tamp down inflation. Asian governments may need to prepare for faster policy normalization following the Fed's move to curb inflationary pressures, according to Rhee.""The situation is quite heterogeneous in Asia. Like Singapore and [South] Korea and several Asian countries, inflation is already higher and the output gap is small. So the central banks have to move quickly as Singapore did this week,"" he said, referring to Singapore's central bank decision on Tuesday to tighten monetary policy over inflationary concerns. The output gap measures the difference between the economy's actual output and the potential output the economy can produce at full capacity.However, there are other Asian countries with an output gap that's still relatively large because they were hit by the Covid-19 delta outbreak last year. As a result, it has hampered their recovery, Rhee noted.""High interest rates in the United States, will force them to react to the monetary policy. So they have a really delicate balancing act at the moment,"" he said. On Tuesday, the IMF slashed its global growth forecast for 2022 due to concerns over increasing Covid cases, supply chain disruptions and higher inflation.It expects global gross domestic product to weaken from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022 — lowering this year's figure by half a percentage point compared to previous estimates.China's growth this year is now expected to come in at just 4.8% — down from an earlier estimate at 5.6%, based on IMF's forecast.  Last week, China reported that its economy grew by 8.1% in 2021 compared to a year ago, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. GDP in the fourth quarter rose 4% year-on-year, faster than analysts expected.The IMF recently said China's zero-Covid policy is looking like a ""burden,"" which is hampering economic recovery both domestically and for the world.Since the pandemic began in early 2020, China's strict policy means mass quarantines and lockdowns, as well as widespread travel restrictions — whether within a city or with other countries — are used to control outbreaks.  Read more about China from CNBC ProThis Chinese social media platform is a buy that can surge 60%, UBS saysMissed the A.I. rally?

HSBC names 4 Chinese stocks set to benefit from the trendGoldman thinks the trade right now is on China's economy and gives 2 U.S. stocks to play it Whether China is able to achieve 4.8% growth rate or even higher depends on the two things, Rhee noted.""One is the dynamics of omicron and the future dynamics of this pandemic,"" which is hard to predict, he said. ""I think they have room to use more fiscal resources. Depending on how much they will use the fiscal resources, China's growth rate will be determined,"" he added.— CNBC's Karen Gilchrist contributed to this report."

There's a risk that the high inflation we are seeing will be prolonged. There's a risk that it will move even higher. So, we don't think that's the base case, but, you asked what the risks are, and we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes,"" Powell said.Powell also mentioned that supply chain issues were taking longer to be resolved than the Fed had originally anticipated.—Jesse Pound  Wed, Jan 26 20223:08 PM EST Stocks gave up their sharp gains from earlier in the day, as traders weighed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments.

2022-01-27,"Adam McKay's recent movie, ""Don't Look Up,"" was a timely example of how our elected leaders react to crises. In the film, a comet is about to destroy all civilization, but the country's leaders don't pay much attention until it is too late and we are all doomed. Welcome to our next major debt crisis.In just a few years, over half of every dollar we pay in income taxes will go to pay the interest on our national debt owned by the public. And it will get worse. When that financial comet strikes, what will our politicians say or do? First, let's have a look at how we got here.Most informed Americans are aware that the national debt and interest rates are both rising. Americans will soon wake up to the fact that the interest on our national debt is costing taxpayers a frightening percentage of our national income and wealth.The comet is about to hit.According to the U.S. Treasury, in fiscal 2021, the amount of interest paid on the national debt was $562 billion including government transfers. The amount actually paid out to holders of U.S. securities was $413 billion. That figure alone, which is over 20% of what we paid in income taxes in FY 2021, should be alarming when compared to other government expenditures. Compare the $413 billion we pay in interest to holders of these securities to the annual budgets of other parts of the government. The State Department annual budget is ""only"" $35 billion and the Justice Department $39 billion. But this interest rate crisis will soon get worse, a lot worse. Here's why: According to the Congressional Budget Office, the average interest rate paid on the national debt in FY 2021 was approximately 1.5%, historically a very low figure. Most experts agree that interest rate increases are coming, and a consensus expectation is that there will be three or four rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022. The central bank on Wednesday strongly hinted that the first rate hike will happen in March, and the market is now pricing in as many as five increases this year alone.As interest rates rise, which they have in dramatic fashion in January, so will the interest rate paid on newly issued Treasury securities. While this is happening, our national debt is exploding. In 2017, the national debt was $20 trillion. Just four years later, that amount is approaching $30 trillion. The recent stimulus programs brought on by the Covid  crisis helped add a staggering $6 trillion to the total.The math is easy. Interest rates are still near an all-time low. According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, in 2001, interest paid on the national debt was an average of 5.4%, about 3½ times what it is now.If we get back to that rate, which is far from inconceivable, interest on the debt would cost American taxpayers $1.4 trillion, based on our present level of national debt. That is twice the budget of the Defense Department. In FY 2021, the total amount of personal income taxes collected was $1.9 trillion. Moreover, the future budget deficits projected by economists will add over a trillion dollars a year to the overall debt, adding substantially to the rising interest cost.The interest rate comet is now visible on the horizon. Americans will not stand for a situation where most of the income taxes we pay go to pay interest to holders of our national debt who live in Japan, China, the U.K. along with others here who own Treasury securities.

2022-01-27,"Gross domestic product accelerated at a 6.9% annualized pace in the fourth quarter, well ahead of the 5.5% estimate.Consumer activity and business spending led the gains, which propelled the U.S. economy to its strongest full year since 1984.Jobless claims remained elevated at 260,000 while orders for long-lasting goods hit their lowest point since April 2020, signaling an end-of-year slowdown. The U.S. economy grew at a much better-than-expected pace to end 2021 from sizeable boosts in inventories and consumer spending, and despite signs that the acceleration likely tailed off toward the end of the year.Gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced during the October-through-December period, increased at a 6.9% annualized pace, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a gain of 5.5%.The increase was well above the unrevised 2.3% growth in the third quarter and came despite a surge in Covid omicron cases that likely slowed hiring and output as businesses dealt with large numbers of sick workers.  Gains came from increases in private inventory investment, strong consumer activity as reflected in personal consumption expenditures, exports, and business spending as measured by nonresidential fixed investment.Across-the-board decreases in the pace of government spending subtracted from GDP, as did imports, which are measured as a drag on output.The quarter brought an end to a 2021 that saw a 5.7% increase in annualized GDP, the strongest pace since 1984 as the U.S. tried to pull away from the unprecedented drop in activity during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.Markets reacted positively to the news, with stock futures posting gains while government bond yields were mixed.""The strength of the economy last year stood in stark contrast to the collapse in activity in early 2020, but also speaks to the success of both the public and private sector in quickly adapting to the unprecedented challenges created by the pandemic,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. ""That being said, potential headwinds still exist, as the global risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic persist.""In other economic news Thursday, jobless claims totaled 260,000 for the week ended Jan. 22, slightly less than the 265,000 estimate and a decline of 30,000 from the previous week. Also, orders for long-lasting goods declined 0.9% for December, worse than the estimate for a 0.6% drop. Orders for durables hit their lowest point since April 2020, reflecting an end-of-year slowdown as omicron cases skyrocketed. The decline was driven largely by a 3.9% slump in transportation orders.The GDP report, though, reflected an overall solid period for the economy after output had slowed considerably over the summer. Supply chain issues tied to the pandemic coupled with robust demand spurred by unprecedented stimulus from Congress and the Federal Reserve led to imbalances across the economic spectrum.Consumer activity, which accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, rose 3.3% for the quarter. Gross private domestic investment, a gauge of business spending and inventory build, soared 32%.Inventories added 4.9 percentage points to the headline growth, boosted in particular by motor vehicle dealers, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economic growth came as inflation surged in 2021, particularly in the second half of the year, as supply couldn't keep up with strong demand, particularly for goods over services.The U.S. heads into 2022 on uncertain footing, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warning Wednesday that growth in the early part of the year is slowing, though he views the economy overall as strong.To that measure, the Fed telegraphed a March interest rate hike, the first since 2018. Central bankers also expect to end their monthly asset purchases the same month and to start unwinding their bond holdings shortly after.

Data on the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, will be released Friday morning.The fourth-quarter data reflected those price pressures as well, with the price index for gross domestic purchases up 6.9% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. The Fed considers 2% a healthy level for inflation, though a new policy approach adopted in 2020 allows for higher levels over a short period of time in the interest of generating full employment.Powell said Wednesday that Fed officials believe they have largely achieved both ends of their employment/inflation mandate and are ready to start raising rates and otherwise tightening monetary policy."
2022-01-27,"Pay raises for teachers, firefighters, police officers and other employees were included in a revised fiscal plan approved Thursday that will serve as Puerto Rico's economic blueprint criticized by some as the island emerges from bankruptcy.The fiscal plan was approved a week after a federal judge signed another plan to slash the island's debt after a nearly five-year bankruptcy battle, marking the largest debt restructuring in U.S. history. It goes into effect March 15.Police officers will see a 36% average salary increase compared with what they earned in fiscal year 2019. Meanwhile, teachers will see an average increase of 27%, firefighters 17% and correctional officers 15%. Even medical residents will see their first salary increase since 2003.Some of those increases, however, are conditional. Pay raises for teachers, firefighters, police officers and other employees were included in a revised fiscal plan approved Thursday that will serve as Puerto Rico's economic blueprint criticized by some as the island emerges from bankruptcy.A federal control board that oversees the U.S. territory's finances noted that many government workers have not seen a pay raise since 2014, a year before Puerto Rico announced it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load accumulated over decades through mismanagement, corruption and excessive borrowing to balance budgets.The fiscal plan was approved a week after a federal judge signed another plan to slash the island's debt after a nearly five-year bankruptcy battle, marking the largest debt restructuring in U.S. history. It goes into effect March 15.""This is a very important moment for (Puerto Rico),"" the fiscal plan stated. ""For the first time in years, it can manage its resources without the cloud of uncertainty of bankruptcy.""Police officers will see a 36% average salary increase compared with what they earned in fiscal year 2019. Meanwhile, teachers will see an average increase of 27%, firefighters 17% and correctional officers 15%. Even medical residents will see their first salary increase since 2003.Some of those increases, however, are conditional.Teachers, for example, will receive half of their increase on July 1, with the other half tied to them finishing a payroll and attendance system and providing for student attendance keeping. Correctional officers face similar requirements.The Association of Puerto Rico Teachers criticized the conditions as well as the pay change, saying it only increases base salaries to $2,220 a month instead of the $3,500 it had requested.""Do you think a teacher can live on the misery he earns and at the end of his days, not even have a dignified retirement?"" the association said in a letter to Gov. Pedro Pierluisi.The revised fiscal plan also includes more than $130 million per year for the next five years for civil service reform in a bid to improve evaluations, recruitment and organizational structure. In addition, the plan includes debt service payments for the first time since the board was created by U.S. Congress in 2016, a year before the island filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.The fiscal plan also aims to strengthen health care, public safety and education infrastructure and services and boost a pension reserve trust to help employees including police officers and symphonic orchestra members by setting aside $10.3 billion over the next decade. Puerto Rico entered the bankruptcy process with more than $50 billion in public pension liabilities.""This fiscal plan is another step in Puerto Rico's recovery,"" said David Skeel, the board's chairman.Puerto Rico now faces $1.5 billion in yearly debt payments as part of the restructuring, instead of the $3.9 billion it once paid. In addition, a new deficit is not expected until 2048.""This is a historic day,"" board member John Nixon said before approving the revised fiscal plan. ""While this is a huge step...there are still several things that we need to work on.""The plan notes that since 2005, Puerto Rico's economy has shrunk, poverty has increased, electricity has remained expensive and unreliable and ""the public sector has provided declining levels of service at a high cost to residents.""Power outages have worsened after Hurricane Maria hit the island in September 2017, razing the power grid and destroying or damaging thousands of homes. Shortly before the board's meeting began, the judicial center in the capital of San Juan announced that a power outage forced them to move some cases to another city and reschedule others.Puerto Rico also has struggled to recover from a string of strong earthquakes that hit the island's southern region two years ago, the strongest ones to strike in a century.As the U.S. territory seeks to emerge from bankruptcy and natural disasters, some have criticized the board and the debt restructuring plan, saying they haven't cut enough debt or provided a path for economic development.""The next few years are going to be harder for certain sectors of the population,"" said Daniel Santamaría Ots, senior policy analyst for Espacios Abiertos, a Puerto Rico think tank. ""The vulnerable will suffer the most.""He also noted that the bankruptcy process has cost Puerto Rico some $1 billion in consultants, lawyers and other expenses, adding that electricity and water rates are increasing, along with toll booth fees and university credits for undergraduate students.""From now on, we will have to pay debt again in a context of austerity with no growth,"" he said.Meanwhile, Sergio Marxuach, policy director and general counsel for the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan local think tank, wrote in a report released Thursday that while the plan to lift Puerto Rico out of bankruptcy is not perfect, it offers some debt relief.""It is a really difficult task to determine, with any certainty, whether the proposed plan is adequate, the time horizon is too long and there are too many variables,"" he stated. ""We believe that both the best-case scenario put forward by the (board) and the worst case scenario favored by those who oppose the plan are unlikely to occur."""
2022-01-28,"The Federal Reserve prefers the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index to gauge inflation over others, like the perhaps better-known Consumer Price Index.That's largely for two reasons: It has a broader scope and better reflects how consumers change what they buy to account for rising prices.The PCE Price Index jumped 5.8% in December from a year earlier, tied for the fastest pace since 1982, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates soon from rock-bottom levels to cool inflation.The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index jumped by 5.8% in December from the year prior, tied for the fastest pace since June 1982, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday.Fed officials prefer this inflation metric over others as the North Star guiding their policy response. The U.S. central bank uses it to grade whether it's on track to hit its 2% inflation target, according to economists.But why is this the preferred gauge? Like the perhaps-better-known Consumer Price Index, the PCE Price Index reflects the prices Americans are paying for a basket of goods and services, and how those costs change over time.But the barometers differ in two key ways.For one, the PCE Price Index has a broader scope than its CPI cousin.More from Personal Finance:Why the stock market hates the idea of rising interest ratesMost Americans want Biden to prioritize student loan forgivenessWhat to do if you win the $421 million Mega Millions jackpotThe latter looks at households' out-of-pocket costs, while the PCE Price Index examines a broader swath of the cost ecosystem, according to economists.Take health care, for example: The PCE Price Index accounts for costs incurred by government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private insurers, where CPI does so just for health costs that directly impact Americans' wallets, according to Josh Bivens, research director at the Economic Policy Institute.""The larger scope is one virtue [of the PCE Price Index],"" Bivens said.  ""When the Fed is looking at inflation, they're less concerned with what is happening to the living standard of the household; they want to know the macroeconomic inflationary pressure building up,"" he added.The Federal Reserve looks primarily at ""core"" prices, which strip out volatile food and energy categories. That PCE Price Index gauge jumped 4.9% in December from a year earlier, the biggest gain since September 1983. The PCE Price Index is also more dynamic, economists said. It better reflects how prices affect consumer behavior and how households respond to rising costs.If beef prices rise significantly, families may instead buy chicken to defray costs, for example.The CPI does this, too, but much more slowly — about every two years instead of each quarter, Bivens said. That's why CPI tends to overstate the rate of inflation — it assumes people buy the same things in years one and two without accounting for substitution bias, according to Marc Goldwein, senior director of policy at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Indeed, inflation jumped 7% in December as measured by the CPI, relative to the 5.4% for the PCE Price Index.""[The CPI] is a bad measure of inflation,"" Goldwein said.Directionally, the indices point in the same general direction, though, he added. Of course, Fed officials don't just look at one data point when judging interest-rate policy. The PCE Price Index gauge may be most important metric, generally speaking, but the central bank weighs economic data like unemployment rate and labor force participation, too.""They are looking at as much data as they can absorb to get the best sense of the dynamics of the economy,"" Goldwein said.High and lingering inflation is the result of supply-and-demand dynamics resulting from the pandemic, economists said.For one, there's been a surge in consumer demand, especially for physical goods. Americans have had a pent-up willingness and ability to spend as they emerge from hibernations at home; government programs like stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits and a student-loan pause also put more cash in their wallets, while interest rates near zero offered cheap access to mortgages and other loans, Goldwein said.""We've done all these things juicing demand,"" Goldwein said.A shift toward more physical goods has also run headlong into supply-chain issues, as manufacturers have grappled with virus-related closures — limiting supply at the same time demand is increasing, Bivens said.Some economists expect inflation to cool throughout 2022, despite any new Fed policies. Fed officials expect the PCE Price Index to temper, to 2.5% to 3%, by the end of the year, they estimated in December. (This projection strips out food and energy prices.)""[Inflation] has lasted longer than people thought,"" Bivens said. ""[But] it has the seeds of its own deceleration"" since high spending on physical goods is unlikely to persist.""No one buys a new car every year,"" he added."
2022-01-28,"The White House warned that the spike in Covid-19 cases in early January could skew the data in next week's jobs report.Brian Deese, President Joe Biden's top economic advisor, said the way the Labor Department collects data may have a pronounced effect on next week's January 2022 jobs report.A recent report from the Census Bureau showed that more than 14 million Americans did not work at some point between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10 due to Covid-19 or related impacts. The White House on Friday warned that the omicron-fueled spike in Covid-19 cases in early January could skew the data in next week's jobs report, as millions of Americans left work due to illness or to care for family members.Brian Deese, President Joe Biden's top economic advisor, told CNBC on Friday that the way the Labor Department collects employment data may have a pronounced effect on the January 2022 data and could show a greater number of unemployed people.""The way that the government samples the data is to take a snapshot in an individual week,"" Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, said an interview on ""Closing Bell.""""And if somebody is out sick for that week — even if they have not been laid off, if they weren't paid getting paid sick leave — they will not be counted as employed,"" he added. Americans ""need to be prepared for January employment data that could look a little strange.""Deese's comments underscored the uncertainty about this month's employment picture. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting a gain of about 200,000 jobs for January, although some analysts on Wall Street are expecting a loss.The White House does not get access to sensitive economic data, including the monthly jobs report, until the day before it's released. The data is provided to the Council of Economic Advisers, which often shares it with the president.  But Deese and the staff at the NEC are likely doing analysis of their own ahead of the Labor Department's release. If the Bureau of Labor Statistics happened to survey Americans on their employment status during the peak days of the omicron variant infections, historical data suggests that January's net change in payrolls could fall short of expectations or even decline.""If you think about omicron in early January, and the impact it was having in terms of the number of people who were out sick, we do expect there to be some real variation in the data,"" Deese said.Data already available to the public may suggest a tough month for the jobs report.The results of the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey that was published last week showed that more than 14 million Americans did not work at some point between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10 because they had Covid, or were caring for someone with the virus, or for a child who did not go to school or daycare.""This is double the number not working due to COVID illness in the Census survey done in early December, and on par with the peak number in the worst of the pandemic this time last year,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote in a social media post dated Jan. 21.""With so many workers out, odds are high that the BLS will report employment declined in January. The BLS survey period used to estimate jobs for the month overlaps with the Census survey,"" he added.Those warnings come as a number of Wall Street economists say they expect the January data to prove weaker than in prior months.

""That said, it's important to appreciate that the margin of error in all payroll forecasts right now is huge.""The lingering pandemic makes the job of collecting reliable employment numbers more difficult — and less reflective of the final count after revisions than in prepandemic times. The Labor Department has over the past two years has tended to issue larger-than-normal revisions to the preliminary employment data.The pandemic has also made Wall Street forecasters' job more difficult and eroded the value of advance expectations. As of Friday, economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 199,000 jobs in January, while Wells Fargo expects a net decline of 100,000 payrolls. Nomura thinks the decline will be around 50,000 jobs.""Omicron has weighed heavily on labor supply this month, because of quarantining workers. We see strong downside risks to January payrolls,"" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave wrote on Tuesday. ""We note that more than half of those who did not work because they were caring for someone or sick with Covid have a high school degree or less. Since these individuals are more likely to be wage workers, there are meaningful downside risks to January nonfarm payrolls.""The upside for Wall Street and Washington is that February could prove a strong jobs month if those who were marked as unemployed in January return to work.""The Omicron shock is likely to be short-lived,"" Bhave added. ""The increase in those who are not working because of concerns about getting or spreading Covid has been very modest relative to the size of the wave. This suggests that headwind to labor supply from the fear of Covid is generally fading.""— CNBC's Michael Bloom, Nate Rattner and Steve Liesman contributed to this report."

Malaysia reported 5,439 new infections on Thursday, according to data from the health ministry. About 78% of the nation's total population has been fully vaccinated, based on the data. Linggi said Malaysia may keep the price controls on essential items for a longer period of time, ""because there is so much pressure on the increase of food prices.""Despite concerns about inflation, Malaysia's central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1.75% on Thursday last week.""For 2022, average headline inflation is likely to remain moderate as the base effect from fuel inflation dissipates,"" the central bank said.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United Arab Emirates will be introducing a federal corporate tax on business profits for the first time, the Ministry of Finance announced Monday.The news represents a significant shift for a country that's long attracted businesses from around the world thanks to its status as a tax-free commerce hub. Businesses will be subject to the tax from June 1, 2023.The country's statutory tax rate will be 9% for taxable income exceeding 375,000 UAE dirhams ($102,000), and zero for taxable income up to that amount ""to support small businesses and startups,"" the ministry said, adding that ""the UAE corporate tax regime will be amongst the most competitive in the world.""Individuals will still not be subject to tax on their incomes from employment, real estate, equity investments or other personal income unrelated to a UAE trade or business, the ministry said. The tax also won't be applied to foreign investors who don't conduct business in the country.As for what constitutes profit, corporate tax will apply on ""the adjusted accounting net profit"" of the business.Free zone business, meanwhile — thousands of which exist in the country — can ""continue to benefit from corporate tax incentives"" as long as they ""meet all necessary requirements,"" the ministry said, without elaborating. Companies within the UAE's many free zones have long enjoyed zero taxes and full foreign ownership, among other benefits.""The UAE corporate tax regime has been designed to incorporate best practices globally and minimise the compliance burden on businesses,"" state news agency WAM wrote.""Corporate tax will be payable on the profits of UAE businesses as reported in their financial statements prepared in accordance with internationally acceptable accounting standards, with minimal exceptions and adjustments. The corporate tax will apply to all businesses and commercial activities alike, except for the extraction of natural resources which will remain subject to Emirate level corporate taxation."" While the news made waves after its announcement on Monday, many in the UAE's business scene say the development shouldn't come as a shock.""I don't think this announcement should come as a surprise; corporation tax in the UAE has been in discussion for several years. And there is already corporation tax in the GCC, in Saudi and Qatar for instance,"" Chris Payne, chief economist at Dubai-based Peninsula Real Estate, told CNBC. As the UAE, like many of its oil-rich regional counterparts, pushes to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbon revenue, ""it's important that the Federal government establishes sources of income that are not reliant on corporate dividends and investment income, both of which can be volatile,"" Payne added.The announcement gives companies in the UAE roughly a year-and-a-half to prepare for taxes, but reactions are mixed on whether the move will allow the Gulf sheikhdom to retain its attractiveness to businesses.Mark Hemmings, vice president of tax and treasury at Dubai-based specialty services firm Kent, views the decision as ""practical and sensible.""""It will be very interesting to see the detail, but at first glance this looks like a practical and sensible approach to ensure companies in the UAE can comply with the anticipated new international tax rules, whilst ensuring the UAE remains an attractive location for businesses to operate,"" Hemmings said. Still, the threshold for being subject to taxation — just over $100,000 of profit a year — is fairly low and could adversely affect smaller enterprises with high set-up and business renewal costs. Rupert Tait, co-founder of UAE-based construction tech start-up Procurified, sees potential headwinds for small businesses like his.""I think that as a start-up founder we want to base ourselves in the most affordable environment to grow,"" he told CNBC. ""While I understand the need for taxation to start, I also know we are indirectly taxed in free zones,"" he said, explaining that his company based in the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre free zone already pays 20,000 UAE dirhams (roughly $5,450) per year, which is paid regardless of profit.""So the corporate tax may cause SMEs to reconsider where they plan to remain (long-term) due to heavy upfront fees and then tax once the business is profitable,"" Tait said. Nonetheless, the proposed tax remains low compared to other low-tax hubs around the world.Montenegro and Gibraltar have tax rates of 9% and 10% respectively, while Ireland and Lichtenstein both offer a 12.5% corporate tax rate. Hong Kong's taxes range from 8.5% to 16.5%, and Singapore and San Marino both have tax rates of 17%. Still, it's yet to be seen what goods and services will be provided in exchange for the new taxes.Ultimately, the move ""brings the UAE in line with other competitive economies,"" said Taufiq Rahim, a non-resident a research fellow at the Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government in Dubai.""And the rate — while new for the private sector here — remains lower than other jurisdictions like Singapore and Hong Kong."""

But many countries are becoming concerned that this approach would push their debt level to extreme highs.Consequently, these nations are now suggesting that climate-friendly investments shouldn't count against their total expenditure — an idea that the more fiscally-conservative nations will find hard to accept.""I would not say 'yes' to that proposal, because debts are debts,"" Austrian Finance Minister Magnus Brunner told CNBC in Brussels, Belgium, this month when asked whether he would approve a debt break for green investments.The 19 euro members are meant to follow EU fiscal rules that state they should not have public deficits above 60% of their GDP (gross domestic product). EU law also obliges countries to keep budget deficits below 3% of GDP.These rules, which aim to keep the region on a sustainable fiscal path, were paused in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic to provide nations with the fiscal leeway to spend more and support their citizens.Now, as the euro zone prepares to reinstate them next year, a debate has emerged over how best to ensure they reflect the market environment — higher debts, a different labor market and higher inflation.Speaking to CNBC earlier in January, Spanish Finance Minister Nadia Calvino said: ""We need to have an appropriate fiscal framework that is growth-friendly.""Spain, France and Italy — among others — do not want to put an abrupt end to the current loose fiscal policy stance, fearing this would damage the economic recovery.The euro zone is actually expected to grow faster than the U.S. in 2022, precisely due to the fact that countries in Europe are able to pump a lot of money into their economies.But other euro nations are adamant that the bloc needs fiscal consolidation to ensure that it can weather any future shocks more easily and avoid worrying financial markets at a time when the European Central Bank is adjusting its policy.Austrian's Brunner said: ""We are very much for stabilization ... sticking to the rules is very important for Austria."" This debate becomes increasingly difficult with Europe's pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% within the next eight years.Climate Action Network Europe, a group representing over 1,500 NGOs and more than 47 million citizens, has previously called for ""fundamental"" reform of EU fiscal rules and economic governance ""to ensure that any additional fiscal space will translate into targeted and effective climate action by Member States.""This is especially important, CAN Europe said, because ""massive public and private investments in climate mitigation and adaptation are urgent to avoid runaway catastrophic climate scenarios.""As noted by the European Central Bank last year, ""there are clear benefits in acting early"" when it comes to tackling the climate emergency. ""The short-term costs of the transition pale in comparison to the costs of unfettered climate change in the medium to long term.""At present, it is not yet clear what stance Germany — the traditional powerhouse of Europe's economy and historically one of the most fiscally-conservative nations — will take on fiscal reform.""The German finance minister in principle does not like the word flexibility,"" Guntram Wolff, director at the think tank Bruegel, told CNBC.However, he added that German Finance Minister Christian Lindner ""might accept a very targeted flexibility on green investments"" given the topic's domestic importance.Other experts have suggested that instead of reforming the fiscal rules to support green investments, the EU will likely raise new joint debt. The bloc surprised markets in 2020 when agreeing to temporarily tap the markets to fund the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. The same instrument could be used to specifically target the transition to carbon neutrality.""The legacy of the pandemic is that we really know now that if the crisis is big enough then common European debt might at least be part of the solution and my bet come two, three, four years from now [is] the climate situation will reach that political level,"" Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank, told CNBC.Ireland's Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe also told CNBC ""this is an important theme"" that will follow the euro area throughout 2022.However, he said that whatever the finance ministers end up deciding upon, one thing is clear: these investments ""cannot all be met by public capital."""
2022-02-01,"Job openings totaled nearly 11 million in December, more than 4.6 million above the total unemployment level, according to the Labor Department.The so-called quits level declined, signaling a slowdown in a trend known as the Great Resignation.Elsewhere, the ISM Manufacturing Index showed a big gain in prices, reflecting ongoing inflation pressures. Job openings totaled nearly 11 million in December while the Great Resignation cooled off, according to Labor Department data Tuesday.Reflecting a tightening labor market, vacancies rose to 10.92 million, well above the FactSet estimate for 10.28 million and an increase of 1.4% from November. The rate of job openings as a share of the labor force was unchanged at 6.8%.The ""quits"" level, which had soared to record highs in recent months amid a confluence of factors, slowed to 4.34 million, a decrease of 3.6%, while the quits rate edged down 0.1 percentage point to 2.9%. At the same time, layoffs and discharges tumbled to 1.17 million, a decline of 10.7% from a month ago and a tumble of nearly 36% from the same month in 2020 to easily the lowest level on record.The discharges level is ""a sign that workers now have more job security than ever before,"" said ZipRecruiter lead economist Sinem Buber. ""Given the trouble businesses are having in finding and attracting new hires, employers are hanging onto the workers they've got.""The JOLTS report is considered a particularly important gauge when measuring labor market slack.December's numbers further pointed to how close the economy is to full employment. There were 4.6 million more vacancies than workers considered unemployed for the month.  January, however, is expected to be a tricky month for job data as the Covid omicron variant sent millions of workers to the sidelines during the month.""[Tuesday's] report suggests that the latest wave of the pandemic brought on by the omicron variant didn't fully hit the labor market in December,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research for Indeed Hiring Lab.""Demand for workers, as measured by job openings, remained robust and layoffs hit a new all-time low. But while the data suggest no major impact in December, the outlook for January is less optimistic,"" Bunker said.In other economic news Tuesday, the ISM Manufacturing survey for January came in at 57.6%, a decline of 1.2 percentage points from December but slightly ahead of the 57.4% Dow Jones estimate. The number represents the share of businesses reporting expansion for the month.Federal Reserve officials are watching the latest data closely as they prepare to embark on their first tightening cycle since 2018.Policymakers say they feel the economy is close to fulfilling the Fed's mandate of full employment, while inflation remains higher than its 2% benchmark.Indeed, the ISM index reflected inflation pressures in the pipeline, as the Prices Index in January hit 76.1%, up 7.9 percentage points from December.The numbers come at a time when other inflation gauges are running at their highest levels in nearly 40 years.In response to the inflationary pressures, markets are expecting the Fed to raise benchmark short-term interest rates five times this year, which would amount to 1.25 percentage points. Several central bank officials on Monday said that the timing is appropriate for policy tightening, and markets are expecting the first quarter-percentage point increase to come in March."
2022-02-01,"The U.S. economy last year grew at its fastest pace since 1984, but that momentum isn't carrying into 2022.An inventory build fueled most of the second-half growth that put annualized GDP up 5.7% for the year.In the first quarter, the economy may not show any gain at all and possibly show a loss in GDP.The pandemic, along with declining help from fiscal and monetary policy, will keep growth in check. Spurred by a massive inventory rebuild and consumers flush with cash, the U.S. economy last year grew at its fastest pace since 1984.Don't expect a repeat performance in 2022.In fact, the year is starting with little growth signs at all as the late-year spread of omicron coupled with the ebbing tailwind of fiscal stimulus has economists across Wall Street knocking down their forecasts for gross domestic product.Combine that with a Federal Reserve that has pivoted from the easiest policy in its history to hawkish inflation-fighters, and the picture has suddenly changed substantially. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow gauge is currently tracking a first-quarter GDP gain of just 0.1%.""The economy is decelerating and downshifting,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis and former chief economist for the National Economic Council under then-President Donald Trump. ""It's not a recession, but it will be if the Fed tries to get too aggressive.""GDP surged at an impressive 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 to close out a year in which the measure of all goods and services produced in the U.S. increased 5.7% on an annualized basis. That came after a pandemic-induced 3.4% decline in 2020, a year that saw the steepest but shortest recession in U.S. history.But the path ahead is less certain. Much of that end-of-year gain was fueled by an inventory rebuild that contributed fully 4.9 percentage points, or 71% of the total. Inventories were responsible for almost all of the third quarter's 2.3% GDP increase.At the same time, Tuesday's ISM Manufacturing survey showed that the pace of new orders, while still showing gains, is slowing substantially.Taken together, that's not much of a recipe for sustained growth.""Inventories are roughly back to where they should be,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""Then you've got growing headwinds from fiscal and monetary policy. So, yeah, growth starting the year will be very soft."" Wall Street economists have been marking down their growth projections quickly.Goldman Sachs slashed its first-quarter GDP outlook to 0.5%, down from 2%. The bank also cut its full-year view to 3.2%, well below the current 3.8% consensus.""Growth is likely to slow abruptly in 2022, as fiscal support fades and, in the near term, virus spread weighs on services spending and prolongs supply chain disruptions,"" Goldman economist Ronnie Walker said in a note for clients. ""Q1 growth is likely to be particularly soft because the fiscal drag will be accompanied by a hit from Omicron.""

We think it will boost 2022 growth by just 15-20 [basis points], compared to our earlier estimate of 50bp,"" Harris wrote. ""Risks of a negative growth [first] quarter are significant, in our view.""A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.Bank of America has another wrinkle in its forecast: a call for seven 25-basis-point rate hikes this year. That's considerably more aggressive than anywhere else on the Street, which is currently pricing in five hikes with about a 31% chance of a sixth, according to the CME.Zandi said the Fed needs to be careful it doesn't go too far in its fight against inflation, which is running at its highest rate in nearly 40 years.""They run the risk of getting ahead of themselves and overdoing it. They have pivoted very hard here,"" he said. ""Market expectations are for five increases. Six is now entering into the debate and discussions. That feels like that could be a rate hike or two too far, given the growing headwinds in the economy."""

2022-02-02,"Federal Reserve nominee Lisa Cook's career is steeped in research on the benefits of equitability and efforts to improve economic growth by reducing race- and gender-based disparities.Cook will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday with fellow nominees Sarah Bloom Raskin and Philip Jefferson.If confirmed by the Senate, Cook would be the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board in its 108 years. Wall Street and Washington will tune in Thursday to what's expected to be a testy nomination hearing for President Joe Biden's latest nominees to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.Among those preparing to testify is economist Lisa Cook, who would bring to the Fed a career steeped in equitability and inequality research and marked by proposals on how federal policy could help improve economic growth through better opportunities for women and racial minorities.That resume, unusual for a Fed nominee, is likely what made Cook a favorite of many Democrats, including Senate Banking Committee Chair Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Her nomination could also lead to a historic development for the central bank since Cook would be the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board in its 108-year history.But the historic nature of her nomination doesn't guarantee a smooth confirmation process in a Senate that is split 50-50 by party.Republicans on the Banking Committee have taken to Twitter to criticize Cook's social media posts, which the GOP says is rife with liberal advocacy. On Wednesday, the day before the hearing, the Republicans said Cook had blocked them on Twitter.Biden nominated Cook, an economics professor at Michigan State University, to serve on the Fed's board of governors at a critical juncture. If confirmed by the Senate, Cook would bring with her decades of research on race-based disparities and global economics at a time when the Fed seeks to orchestrate a pullback of its easy-money policies to fight inflation rates around 7%.Cook offered her thoughts on inflation late last year, when she told Detroit-based WDET that the current jump in prices isn't like prior increases.""I would certainly say that we're seeing inflation. I'm seeing my grocery bill go up just like everyone else,"" she told the radio station in November.""I would prefer to call what is happening 'supply disruptions,' because this economy is still being run by the pandemic,"" she added. ""If there were no pandemic, we wouldn't be talking about this. We would still be — the Fed would still be worrying about hitting a 2% inflation target.""The Georgia native will testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday with fellow nominees Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former board member tapped for vice chair for supervision, and Philip Jefferson, an economist with central banking experience.For much of her career, Cook studied disparities in the market for intellectual property and innovation. Specifically, she's spent years trying to determine why the U.S. government grants so few patents to women and Black Americans.""Whatever their source, gender and racial disparities exist at each stage of the innovation process — education and training, the practice of invention, and commercialization of invention — and can be costly to both productivity and the economy,"" she wrote in 2020.

Tim Scott of South Carolina files paperwork to run for presidentG-7 leaders commit to more Russia sanctions with Ukraine's Zelenskyy set to attend summit Cook also spent considerable time studying global economics, including her firsthand experience with inflation when she served as an advisor in Nigeria and research on Soviet innovation while completing her dissertation.She received a bachelor's degree from Spelman College in Atlanta and earned her Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Less than a day before the hearing, there are signs that it could prove contentious.The official Senate Banking GOP account on Wednesday morning said that Cook had blocked its access to her profile and tweets. The Republican account had just days earlier used some of Cook's prior social media posts to argue that she's too partisan to join the Fed.""For years, Prof. Cook has used her Twitter account to engage in partisan political fights, taking extreme Left-wing positions on issues, especially noneconomic topics,"" the Senate Banking GOP account wrote on Jan. 31. ""This begs the question: Will @drlisadcook respect the @federalreserve's independence?""Meanwhile, Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania and the committee's ranking member, told CNBC Wednesday morning that he's concerned about Cook's fellow nominee Raskin. Toomey said he's skeptical of her candidacy given her recent comments on climate change and what he views as her reluctance to curb capital to fossil fuel companies.Toomey, who is not seeking reelection this year, has also been a harsh critic of nominees who would seek to gradually extend the Fed's powers beyond a strict interpretation of maximum employment and inflation control, a process he refers to as ""mission creep."" While some have criticized Cook's advocacy, her supporters say her addition to the Fed would be welcome at an institution long criticized for its lack of diversity. She worked as a senior economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration and spent a year as a Treasury Department official during the Clinton and George W. Bush years.""Throughout their long, distinguished careers, [the three nominees have] proven they understand how our economy works – and who makes it work,"" Brown, one of Cook's biggest allies, said in a news release last month.""They will also bring important perspectives to the Federal Reserve Board about the economic issues women, Black and brown workers, and rural and industrial communities across the country face,"" he added at the time. ""I urge my colleagues to support these nominees and look forward to their hearings before the Banking and Housing Committee."" Based on a career studying inequalities, it's likely Cook would prove a critical voice at the Fed in debates over how to hike interest rates in an economy where Black Americans continue to lag in the national employment recovery.While the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.9% from 4.2% in December, the jobless rate for Black women rose 4.9% to 6.2%, compared with 3.1% for white women. The unemployment rate for Black men inched lower in the final month of the year to 7% from 7.2%, still well above the 3% for white men.Congress tasks the Fed with maximizing employment and ensure price stability. With inflation at multidecade highs, many economists and politicians have implored the Fed to begin to hike interest rates, which are designed to restrict borrowing and curb spending throughout the economy.While that seems to be the majority opinion on Wall Street and Capitol Hill, some stress that the Fed should take its time and consider a broader definition of what it considers maximum employment to account for race-based disparities.Cook and others say reducing disparities in race-based economic indicators could lead to larger GDP growth overall.""What's at stake for this economy and the world economy if policymakers do not get this right and address these disparities?"" Cook asked rhetorically at the conference.  ""The productive capacity of the United States and the world economy, higher living standards that should follow from sustained long-run growth, and greater stability that is consistent with less unequal societies."""
2022-02-02,"NFT stands for ""non-fungible token,"" which is a unique digital asset that has proof of ownership and verification of authenticity held in the blockchain.An NFT can be digital art, real estate, collectibles, event tickets, website domains or even tweets.Even though the possibilities of NFTs may seem endless, just like every new investment/asset class, you should invest with caution. It's safe to say that we have all heard the term ""NFT."" But what exactly is it and what are its pros and cons?NFT stands for ""non-fungible token,"" which is broken down into two main functions: The ""non-fungible"" side refers to its non-replicable aspect of being the only unique version of the asset. You can think of it as having an individualized digital fingerprint for each NFT asset, where the subtle uniqueness of every project has its own value. Next, we look at the ""token"" side, which refers to the proof of ownership of the NFT asset itself.You may wonder: What's to stop someone from taking a screenshot of your digital asset and trying to pass it off as their own?

So when it comes time to sell that NFT or take advantage of its real-world perks, owning the official NFT and not just a screenshot has tremendous value.Basically, NFTs can be unique digital art assets, real estate, collectibles, event tickets, website domains or even tweets that are sold to investors on the blockchain. They can include any kind of art that can be rendered in digital form — music, video, imagery, memes or a combination of media.Here are some pros:NFTs provide a record of authenticity and ownership held and verifiable on the blockchain.They've fashioned a new market to create wealth, with high growth potential.NFTs generate efficiency with (smart) contracts by streamlining processes and eliminating intermediaries.They empower a new marketplace for artists, allowing them to sell directly to collectors and receive royalties whenever the art is resold.NFTs can potentially add diversification to your financial portfolio, as the economy and companies prepare for what's next in a post-pandemic world. (That's of course, only if you have the risk tolerance and liquid cash to invest at all.)Some NFTs give you real-world perks such as access to high-end events, groups or associations depending on who the creators are. The new asset class does have some tremendous highlights, but let's look at the cons:NFTs are illiquid and speculative investments. Since it is a new asset and marketplace, there is not a lot of historical data to research.It is a very volatile investment. As with most art, digital or physical, the value of it is relative and based on what someone is willing to pay for it. That's the ""unique"" nature of a NFT, which can be viewed as both a pro or a con.They are not great for the environment. Over time, the effects of producing NFTs, or all types of cryptocurrency, can have a tremendous negative long-term effect on our environment.There is a potential for fraud and scammers within the space. Despite the blockchain, NFTs are currently able to be hacked and stolen, which adds another big risk to consider.The market for NFTs is huge and is only getting bigger. However, even though the possibilities of NFTs may seem endless, just like every new investment/asset class, you should invest with caution because of the very risky and speculative nature of new, undefined markets.— By Jordan Awoye, managing partner at Awoye Capital"
2022-02-02,"Judging by the opinions of some major Wall Street forecasters, employment either slowed to a crawl or perhaps even turned negative in January.ADP reported Wednesday that companies slashed 301,000 jobs in the month.PNC is expecting Friday's payrolls report to show a decline of 400,000 while Goldman Sachs is forecasting a drop of 250,000. Consensus forecast is for a gain of 150,000. A jobs market that was on fire for most of 2021 looks like it was dealt a cold splash of reality to start the new year.Judging by the opinions of some major Wall Street forecasters and fortified Wednesday by data from payroll processing firm ADP, employment in January either slowed to a crawl — or perhaps even turned negative.ADP reported that companies subtracted 301,000 jobs during the month, spurred largely by swelling Covid-19 omicron cases and a wider slowdown in business conditions.The report comes two days before the U.S. Labor Department releases its widely watched nonfarm payrolls count. Consensus estimates see a gain of 150,000 jobs, according to Dow Jones, but the drumbeat is building on Wall Street that the actual tally will be far lower. Even the White House last week cautioned that the report could be weak due to the impact of the omicron surge in January.""The good news is that the job market should quickly bounce back as the omicron variant fades. Underlying demand in the economy is still strong, and businesses are still trying to hire,"" said Gus Faucher, chief U.S. economist at PNC. ""But the January drop in employment is another reminder that the economy will not fully return to normal until the pandemic is over."" PNC is possibly the most pessimistic voice on the Street, with a projection that nonfarm payrolls contracted by 400,000 in January, including a 350,000 decline in the private sector.The losses, Faucher said, ""were likely due to a combination of factors,"" most of them related to Covid. They include workers either dealing with their own virus infections, or having to take care of sick family members, parents who managed kids who were not being able to go to school, and weaker demand in pandemic-sensitive industries like bars, restaurants and hotels.That has become a familiar refrain in the economic community.Goldman Sachs forecasts a 250,000 drop in payrolls due to ""a large and likely temporary drag"" due to the pandemic, while Citigroup sees a modest upside, with growth of just 70,000 jobs.""The downside risk to payrolls has been well telegraphed and we would not be surprised, nor necessarily concerned, to see an outright decline in January employment that would likely bounce back in the coming months,"" Citi economist Veronica Clark said in a note.Economists believe a sharp decline in Covid cases, in which the seven-day moving average has dropped about 45% in the past two weeks, will help resuscitate the jobs market. However, that average peaked on Jan. 15, which is the same week the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses as its sample for the monthly report. The changing winds follow a record year for jobs — nearly 6.5 million payroll additions despite a modest pullback in the pace over the last two months of the year. The last time the BLS report showed a negative number was in December 2020.However, the employment level remains 2.9 million below where it was pre-pandemic in February 2020. That's due to another confluence of events, including a surge in retirements, a general labor shortage that has seen job openings outnumber available workers by 4.6 million, and myriad impacts from the pandemic.A decline in January would push the labor market even further back and could spur an early-year growth scare in which first-quarter GDP could show little gain and possibly a loss.From a market perspective, stocks have been rallying the past four days, with some of the high-growth tech names leading the charge. But jitters over an economy slowing while the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates could inject some volatility back to Wall Street.""If [Friday's report] comes in at minus [300,000], that might have some near-term impact,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. ""Even if you think we're going to get through it, it will scare you until that point.""Paulsen, though, is in the camp that sees the January numbers as temporary, a feeling generally shared among economists. He said it was likely that the market will look through the report and that the Fed likely will not be swayed off its course of raising rates to combat swelling inflation.""As far as [the jobs market] being weak, I don't know if anyone's going to give it much credence,"" Paulsen said. ""You've clearly got omicron cases collapsing. You're seeing some high-frequency data showing some pretty significant pickups. I just think that calms a lot of the marketplace."""
2022-02-03," Airbnb made CNBC's Disruptor 50 list eight times, more than any other company in the last decade.Covid halved its private valuation, but it is now five times that size as a public company after completing a 2020 IPO many thought had been indefinitely shelved by the pandemic.As the company faces new challenges and recurring political battles, CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky says 2022 is ""back to our roots, back to the basics.""   In this weekly series, CNBC takes a look at companies that made the inaugural Disruptor 50 list, 10 years later.It's hard to think of a more quintessential story in disruption than Airbnb — the company made CNBC's Disruptor 50 list eight times, more than any other company in the last decade, prior to going public at the end of 2020.And years from now, it'll be hard to imagine how any company, much less a travel company, made its market debut at the height of a global pandemic the way Airbnb did.To get through the crisis, the company laid off about 25% of its workforce — about 1,900 of its 7,500 employees — and raised $2 billion in a combination of equity and debt to shore up its balance sheet. The equity portion of the deal valued Airbnb at $18 billion, nearly half of what the company was worth in 2017. At the time, Airbnb also decided to ""pause"" activities that did not directly support the core of its host community, such as transportation and Airbnb Studios, and scaled back its investments in hotels and luxury properties. But as Sequoia Capital partner Roelof Botha told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa just months before the IPO — after a company that once topped the Disruptor 50 list had just fallen to No. 41 due in large-part to the pandemic — ""like all businesses that involve human interaction, the sharing economy took a huge hit when Covid emerged and shelter-in-place was enforced ... but people are itching to get out of their homes.""His thesis was validated when Airbnb shares ended up 112% on its first day of trading, blowing past the market caps of giant travel industry incumbents like Booking Holdings, Expedia, and hotel chains like Marriott and Hilton. In 2022, it has been a different story, with Airbnb shares negative on the year, but the stock has held up better than other growth-oriented companies and the overall tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which is down about 12% year to date.""When we started Airbnb, it was about belonging and connection. This crisis has sharpened our focus to get back to our roots, back to the basics, back to what is truly special about Airbnb — everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences,"" said co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky in a letter to his employees on May 5.Airbnb implemented measures to keep its guests and hosts happy, but the result was a wave of criticism for seemingly every step it took. Airbnb has also teamed up with rival Vrbo, owned by Expedia, to combat the issues.Problems are recurring for other notable Disruptor 50 companies in the gig economy such as Uber, which has also struggled with user satisfaction, as well as supply and demand imbalances amid the pandemic.

Chesky famously lived exclusively in Airbnb rentals for a few months in 2010 when the company's earliest employees were crowding out what little bedroom space was left in his San Francisco apartment.Twelve years later, it's an indication that Chesky believes his company's next act will largely depend on the same level of devotion to its customers that was required early on, in order to win using a gig economy business model that many investors remain skeptical on. Another key element that will define Airbnb's future will be the regulatory environment in which the company operates. Despite a number of legal battles that plagued the company's growth story since those early days, Airbnb has remained largely unscathed when compared to other highly valued tech platforms. In 2014, New York threatened to ban short-term Airbnb rentals, and a year later, the company spent $8 million to combat a citizen-led ballot initiative meant to limit the platform's listings.Shortly after that there were even louder rumblings about Airbnb's impact on the social fabric of wherever it does business. In July 2016, Sen. Elizabeth Warren urged the Federal Trade Commission to look into how such platforms were exacerbating housing shortages. Hillary Clinton also called out the sharing economy as a potential factor in dampened wage growth last year.Critics have argued that the gig economy enables landlords to turn permanent apartments into high-priced short-term stays, squeezing housing supply in already-expensive markets like San Francisco. Airbnb has maintained that most of its customers are middle class people who boost their income with Airbnb's services — which for many remains the case. And, believe it or not, there's opportunity in crypto.In fact, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was one of the company's first software engineers, who Chesky applauded in a CNBC interview last year, saying ""Brian actually is one of the original architects of our payment platform and our fraud detection system. So I'm really, really proud of what he's doing.""At the time, Chesky said he's ""kept in touch"" with Armstrong.Asked by CNBC's Deirdre Bosa whether Airbnb has any plans related to cryptocurrency adoption, Chesky said he did not ""have anything to announce right now. But I can tell you that we've been certainly looking at this.""In a more recent Twitter thread, Chesky acknowledged that ""crypto payments"" is among Airbnb users' top suggestion.But it's the blockchain technology underpinning crypto that could become Airbnb's next act. Proponents expect blockchain adoption to grow in the coming years, with some people comparing its disruptive potential to being akin to the early days of the internet.For Chesky, it's ""like the revolution in travel"" the CEO saw decades ago when Airbnb was clawing towards ""ramen profitability"" as a a darling of start-up lore.CNBC is now accepting nominations for the 2022 Disruptor 50 list, our annual look at private innovators using breakthrough technology to transform industries and become the next generation of great public companies.

2022-02-03,"Markets had broadly expected the 25 basis point rate increase, which the Monetary Policy Committee voted for unanimously and which takes the main Bank Rate to 0.5%, as the central bank strives to contain soaring inflation.The Bank fired the starting gun on rate rises in December, hiking its main interest rate to 0.25% from its historic low of 0.1%. LONDON — The Bank of England on Thursday imposed back-to-back interest rate hikes for the first time since 2004 and began the process of quantitative tightening.Markets had broadly expected the 25 basis point rate increase, which the Monetary Policy Committee voted for 5-4 and which takes the main Bank Rate to 0.5%, as the central bank strives to contain soaring inflation. Four members voted to increase rates by 50 basis points to 0.75%.The Bank fired the starting gun on rate rises in December, hiking its main interest rate to 0.25% from its historic low of 0.1%.Since then, data has shown U.K. inflation soared to a 30-year high in December as higher energy costs, resurgent demand and supply chain issues continued to drive up consumer prices.The Bank of England on Thursday also raised its inflation forecast to an April peak of 7.25% from the 6% projected in its December report.The labor market recovery has remained robust in the U.K., with 184,000 staff added to payrolls in December, putting the total estimate of payrolled employees 409,000 higher than its pre-Covid level. The Bank of England stuck with past guidance to the market to expect quantitative tightening once the Bank Rate reached 0.5%, reducing its government and corporate bond purchase target by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets. A program of corporate bond sales is set to be completed no earlier than late 2023, which would fully unwind the central bank's stock of corporate bond purchases.In its report, the MPC said any further tightening of monetary policy will depend on the medium-term prospects for inflation.""The MPC judges that, if the economy develops broadly in line with the February Report central projections, some further modest tightening in monetary policy is likely to be appropriate in the coming months,"" it said.""The Committee continues to judge that there are two-sided risks around the medium-term inflation outlook, primarily from wage developments on the upside and from energy and global tradable goods prices on the downside.""Sterling was up 0.2% against the dollar shortly after the decision, while U.K. bond yields shot up. The 10-year gilt yield hit its highest point since early 2019 at 1.345%, gaining nine basis points on the day. The two-year gilt yield rose to around 1.13% and 30-year gilt yields climbed to 0.31%. Anna Stupnytska, global macro economist at Fidelity International, said with inflation surging and proving more persistent than policymakers initially presumed, the Bank of England is ""taking no chances"" of risking de-anchoring inflation expectations. ""Concerned about its credibility as an inflation targetter, the BOE is the first major central bank embarking on the inflation fighting experiment in the environment of slowing growth momentum and continued dislocations in the energy markets, fueling the cost of living crisis as real incomes are getting squeezed,"" Stupnytska said.""Partly because of this challenging backdrop, we believe the BOE hiking trajectory is likely to be shallower than current market pricing of nearly 5 hikes in 2022, with growth challenges and the high debt burden acting as key constraints.""Britain's energy regulator on Thursday increased its energy price cap by 54% as supply side problems continue to exert upward pressure on costs.Given inflation remains the dominant narrative, Stupnytska said the risk of a policy mistake from the central bank remains ""uncomfortably high.""""As the Fed joins the BOE in the hiking cycle later this year, market vulnerabilities will likely come in sharp focus as the policy punchbowl starts getting withdrawn.""The 'elephant in the room'Many economists were surprised that four members of the MPC voted for a 50 basis point hike in interest rates, and suggested it could point to a more hawkish approach as the Bank attempts to wrestle inflation back toward its 2% target.""Investors and households have got used to quite gradual increases in the level of rates, so the fact that so many policy makers thought a large increase was appropriate today will put markets at notice that more sudden shifts in policy are possible, which will increase uncertainty and volatility,"" said Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at Abrdn.However, with energy prices continuing to soar, the Bank will be wary of inflicting too much pain on already-struggling households, especially those on low income.Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager at Quilter investors, said energy prices will remain ""the elephant in the room"" and the Bank will have to hope that they don't keep escalating.""The squeeze for the real economy ahead is real and can already see the heart-breaking stories in the news. The Chancellor, like during the pandemic, will need to be ready to step up when required and act in tandem with the BoE to prevent the economic recovery being choked off,"" Patel said.""For investors, what this rate rise means they will need to be braced for more volatility in fixed income markets and avoid it where possible. Owning companies that can deal with price shocks will ultimately prevail, meaning quality will remain crucial while we navigate this rocky period."""
2022-02-04,"Nonfarm payrolls rose 467,000 in January, well ahead of the 150,000 Wall Street estimate.Leisure and hospitality led the gains, while professional and business services and retail also posted big numbers.Wages surged, rising 0.7% for the month and 5.7% for the year.Massive revisions juiced up the November and December totals by 709,000. Job growth rose far more than expected in January despite surging omicron cases that seemingly sent millions of workers to the sidelines, the Labor Department reported Friday.Nonfarm payrolls surged by 467,000 for the month, while the unemployment rate edged higher to 4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Dow Jones estimate was for payroll growth of 150,000 and a 3.9% unemployment rate.The stunning gain came a week after the White House warned that the numbers could be low due to the pandemic.  Covid cases, however, have plunged nationally in recent weeks, with the seven-day moving average down more than 50% since peaking in mid-January, according to the CDC. Most economists had expected January's number to be tepid due to the virus, though they were looking for stronger gains ahead.Along with the big upside surprise for January, massive revisions sent previous months considerably higher.December, which initially was reported as a gain of 199,000, went up to 510,000. November surged to 647,000 from the previously reported 249,000. For the two months alone, the initial counts were revised up by 709,000. The revisions came as part of the annual adjustments from the BLS that saw sizeable changes for many of the months in 2021.Those changes brought the 2021 total to 6.665 million, easily the biggest single-year gain in U.S. history.""The benchmark revisions helped the numbers a bit just because it moved out some of the seasonal factors that have been at work. But overall the job market is strong, particularly in the face of omicron,"" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. ""It's hard to find a weak spot in this report.""For January, the biggest employment gains came in leisure and hospitality, which saw 151,000 hires, 108,000 of which came from bars and restaurants. Professional and business services contributed 86,000, while retail was up 61,000.Earnings also rose sharply, accelerating 0.7%, good for a 12-month gain of 5.7% and providing confirmation that inflation continues to gather strength. That yearly move was the biggest gain since May 2020 when wage numbers were distorted by the pandemic. The rate of wage gains, however, still lags inflation, which was running around 7% in December as gauged by the consumer price index.There was more good jobs news: The labor force participation rate rose to 62.2%, a 0.3 percentage point gain. That took the rate, which is closely watched by Fed officials, to its highest level since March 2020 and within 1.2 percentage points of where it was pre-pandemic. The labor force participation rate for women rose to 57%.A more encompassing level of unemployment that counts discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons dropped to 7.1%, a 0.2 percentage point decline and to just above its pre-pandemic level. Those working part-time for economic reasons fell by 212,000 in January, with the total level down 37% from a year ago.  ""These data make it clear that the labor market ahead of Omicron was much stronger than previously believed, and it's very tempting to argue that the [January] data mean that all danger of an Omicron hit has passed,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "" We're a bit more cautious than that, not least because the near-real-time data fell through most of [January] and have only just begun to recover.""The job gains brought employment back to about 1.7 million below where it was in February 2020, a month before the pandemic declaration.Stocks were mixed on the report and volatile. Government bond yields spiked, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rising to 1.91%.Markets have been anticipating an inflation-fighting Fed to hike interest rates at least five times in 2022, so the resilient jobs market is likely to do little to dissuade that sentiment. The probability of the central bank increasing its benchmark short-term rate by half a percentage point, or 50 basis points, rose to 27% after the jobs report, according to the CME's FedWatch gauge. The Fed usually hikes in 25 basis point increments.The chance of six increases this year rose to 51% following the report.""They definitely will feel more behind the curve,"" Jones said. ""I don't think there's a 50 basis point hike coming in March, but I think speculation about it will build and that will continue to push up on yields.""The job gains were broad-based, with transportation and warehousing adding 54,000, local government education rising by 29,000 and health care moving higher by 18,000.The unemployment rate for Blacks edged lower to 6.9%. The rate for Asians also declined, falling to 3.6%.The gain in jobs followed a report earlier in the week from payrolls processing firm ADP, which had indicated a drop of 301,000. The two counts also differed widely in December, though the BLS revision brought the total closer to the ADP count of a 776,000 gain for that month."
2022-02-04,"The U.S. economy added a whopping 467,000 jobs in January despite a surge in omicron coronavirus cases, according to the Bureau of Statistics' latest jobs report, showing promising signs of recovery amid the ongoing pandemic and staffing shortages. Yet much of that growth was driven by men: New research from the National Women's Law Center shows that over one million men joined the labor force in January, compared to just 39,000 women. Men have now recouped all of their job losses since the pandemic began, while women are struggling to catch up. There are nearly 1.1 million fewer women in the labor force now compared to February 2020, the NWLC reports. ""This report was not a pleasant surprise,"" Jasmine Tucker, the NWLC's director of research, tells CNBC Make It. ""While I was happy to see the boom in hiring, the sharp contrast in men and women working or seeking jobs is baffling and incredibly troubling."" This gap likely reflects omicron-driven disruptions to school and child care over the past six weeks, as women tend to be the ones to leave their jobs or reduce their hours to look after children. Mothers are more than three times as likely as fathers to take on more housework and child-care responsibilities during the pandemic, according to September's ""Women in the Workplace"" report from McKinsey and LeanIn.Org.Of the 467,000 jobs added to the economy last month, 188,000 (about 40%) went to women. The NWLC estimates that it would take about 10 months of growth at January's rate, however, for women to recoup all of their pandemic job losses.Retail trade and leisure and hospitality saw significant job gains last month, adding 61,400 and 151,000 new positions, respectively. Women only gained 52,000 jobs in leisure and hospitality, or about 34%, but took 45,000, or about 73%, of the jobs added in retail trade. Women lost 17,000 jobs in the education and health services sector, while men gained 29,000. ""It's clear from these numbers that child-care and school closures have hardly impacted men,"" Tucker says. ""Women are shouldering the impact of these disruptions, and it's leading to a huge disparity in their ability to work."" Two groups experienced a drop in unemployment last month: Black women (6.2% to 5.8%) and Asian women (3.3% to 3.2%), while the unemployment rates for white and Latina women remained unchanged at 3.1% and 4.9%. While it's difficult to predict when in-person child care and school will resume full-time, hiring managers can help mitigate some of the obstacles keeping women from working. Julie Vogtman, the director of job quality and senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, told CNBC Make It last month that offering employees higher wages and more paid time off would be a great start – but flexible work schedules could be a ""game-changer"" for keeping women in the workforce, and enticing more to return, she said, as it could help them better manage caregiving responsibilities.Otherwise, Tucker notes, ""women are going to continue to bear the brunt of pandemic job losses."" She continues: ""I would hope that almost two years into this crisis, we would be closer to where we were pre-pandemic – we want women to recoup their losses just like men have at this point, but that's not happening, and that's a real crisis."" Check out:Don't make these 3 mistakes when applying for a remote job, says career coachWhy knowing how much your colleagues earn could be a good thing4.8 million working parents have 'preventable' burnout—here are 5 things that can ease the stressSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"
2022-02-04,"The Biden administration misread the rising threat of inflation for a variety of reasons, according to several economists and current and former government officials.Those reasons include Fed influence across the administration, the folly of traditional economic forecasting, political pressure to spend big and a lack of urgency in deciding who would run the Federal Reserve, they said.""It's always going to be an issue in any White House, how the policy and politics interact,"" said a former Fed official. ""I just think they miscalculated."" When President Joe Biden nominated former Fed Chair Janet Yellen to run the Treasury Department, his rationale was simple: ""No one is better prepared to deal with this crisis.""The crisis to which he referred was a ""K-shaped"" economic recovery that had exacerbated inequality in the wake of a once-in-a-generation pandemic. The administration had a simple plan, and Yellen would help carry it out. Once hundreds of millions of Americans were vaccinated against Covid-19, and trillions of dollars in new government spending flowed into the economy, the world would return to normal under a supercharged recovery.related investing newsThe Fed could enact a 'substitute' interest rate hike at its June meetingJeff Coxa day agoOne year later, a different problem — inflation — is dampening the recovery, sucking the oxygen out of strategy sessions, angering voters and threatening Democrats' razor-thin governing margins. This is happening despite warnings from economists and months of vows from the Federal Reserve and the White House it would be short-lived.Yellen, having herself helmed the central bank, which is tasked with monitoring and managing inflation, would seem uniquely suited for a moment when inflation is hitting four-decade highs. So how did the Biden administration miss the warning signs, and end up in this position?More than a dozen economists, current and former administration officials, and former Fed officials — requesting anonymity to speak candidly about private discussions — point to a confluence of issues, including heavy Fed influence across the administration, overreliance on traditional forecasting, the political pressure to spend big, and a lack of urgency in deciding who would run the Federal Reserve and carry out its mission of managing inflation.""It's always going to be an issue in any White House, how the policy and politics interact,"" said a former Fed official, who requested anonymity to discuss private discussions with the administration. ""I just think they miscalculated.""The Fed and the White House declined to comment on the record. When Yellen took office in early 2021, she moved quickly to staff up Treasury, which was understaffed after the departure of Trump administration political appointees and because her predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, had shrunk the department. To do so, Yellen poached experts in economics and labyrinthine political processes from the well she knew best — the Federal Reserve — causing a revolving door of new hires to spin even more quickly than normal.Among those who came from the top ranks of the Fed to advise Yellen directly at Treasury: Linda Robertson, Michael Kiley and former Fed attorney Mary Watkins. Robertson and Kiley served on limited-term details and have since returned to the Fed, Robertson to shepherd the nominations of top Federal Reserve officials, and Kiley in a senior role overseeing financial stability. Watkins remains at Treasury as an attorney-advisor working on digital currencies.A familiar joke began circling the halls of the Federal Reserve, comparing the Yellen Treasury to the administration of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who had been filling out his ranks with colleagues from his days working at the European Central Bank and the Bank of Italy.""It was like, 'The problem in the modern world is trying to ensure that administrations are independent of their central bank, not that the central bank is independent from the administration,"" according to a second former Fed official who requested anonymity to discuss private discussions.The Fed influx continued, reaching Treasury's organizational masthead, White House policy positions and other regulatory agencies.The two deputy directors of the White House's National Economic Council — Daleep Singh and Sameera Fazili — have Fed and Treasury ties. The Council of Economic Advisers, which Yellen once chaired, features former Fed economists. And atop the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a banking regulator, sit two former Federal Reserve regulatory and legal officials whom Yellen recommended. Fed alums feature prominently in Treasury's top personnel appointments. Nellie Liang, undersecretary for Domestic Finance, was previously the Fed's founding director of financial stability. Acting general counsel Laurie Schaffer was previously the Fed's deputy general counsel. And at least three deputy assistant secretaries with jurisdiction over financial regulation and macroeconomics hail from the Federal Reserve system.  The result, according to several officials who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, is an agency that's been described as operating like a ""think tank,"" in a ""Fed-like posture,"" and taking an ""unusually analytic"" approach to a traditionally fast-moving agency focused on implementing a firehose of policies and problem-solving measures to promote the president's agenda. They tended to dwell on similar data as the Fed, a detail that became problematic as the pandemic rendered those models irrelevant.  While the volume of former Fed personnel within the Treasury has increased communication between the administration and the central bank, the more formal channels are also well established.Monthly lunches with the Council of Economic Advisers — the White House's in-house forecasting shop — have largely resumed after a pause due to the pandemic and frequent personnel changes toward the end of the Trump administration. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Yellen trade views over a weekly breakfast, a tradition Yellen carried out when she chaired the central bank. Kevin Hassett, who broke bread with both Yellen and Powell when he chaired Trump's Council of Economic Advisors, said Yellen would be better served by staff with a more balanced approach, but that the close bond between Treasury and Fed remains important.  ""They come at things from different angles,"" Hassett told CNBC. ""But I think they're a good team."" Sarah Binder, an historian and senior fellow at Brookings Governance, notes that close coordination on monetary and fiscal policy is necessary in times of crisis but comes with an asterisk. ""Certainly, trust is important,"" says Binder, who researches Federal Reserve independence. ""The only thing one might ask here is whether there is a danger of groupthink if that's the only set of voices."" Hassett was part of a trio of former White House economists, including Clinton Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Obama CEA chair Jason Furman, who warned early in Biden's term that inflation was afoot, when the government was more concerned with Covid. They parsed different data but arrived at the same conclusions: Trillions in stimulus spending being plowed back into the economy when companies couldn't produce enough of what consumers wanted would drive prices higher.""It's obvious to a person who does macroeconomic modeling of the modern variety that inflation was going to take off,"" Hassett told CNBC. Last April, Hassett declared that the inflation ""fire was on"" and by June determined that inflation would reach 7% by the end of the year.Indeed, the consumer price index report for December showed that inflation grew at an annual rate of 7%, the hottest pace since 1982. Prices for core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose 4.9% in December compared to the prior year and rose 5.8% including gas and groceries. (Update: January's CPI report, released Feb. 10, showed that inflation increased at a 7.5% annual rate.)At the beginning of 2021, traditional forecasts were far more muted: The private sector estimated 1.8% by year-end, the same as the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office was tracking even lower at 1.5%. The White House's own estimates — calculated by the ""troika"" of the Council of Economic Advisers, Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget — hewed closely to those figures. ""We ultimately sort of came within spitting distance of where the Fed was, but we came there by our own independent analysis,"" a Treasury official told CNBC. On virtual discussions in early spring, White House officials acknowledged the possibility of inflation wrought by stimulus and infrastructure spending, but the risk was dismissed by officials citing the political popularity of the policies and the desire to add more fuel to the economic recovery, according to three people involved in or briefed on discussions. In calling for passage of the $1.9 trillion pandemic stimulus bill, just a month after Congress approved a separate $900 billion package, Biden often lamented the small size of the $800 billion stimulus passed in 2009 during the financial crisis and the weak economic growth that followed.""We have learned from past crises: The risk is not doing too much. The risk is not doing enough,"" Biden told reporters from the Oval Office in late January. He signed the bill into law in March.Yellen voiced support for the administration's desire to ""go big,"" but was also circumspect on the possibility prices might rise. In a series of Sunday TV news appearances, she said inflation was a ""risk"" of stimulus, and in May, she went a step further — suggesting interest rates may need to rise to keep a lid on inflationary pressures, a comment she later walked back. ""Janet [Yellen] was concerned about inflation for a long time,"" Furman, the former Obama economist, told CNBC, differentiating the Treasury secretary's approach from that of the White House. ""There was a lot of wishful thinking that, like, everything increasing inflation would go away, but nothing new would emerge to cause inflation."" A Treasury spokesperson said Yellen believes the legislation backed by the president was sound economic policy that engendered a faster recovery than expected with less financial pain.""Secretary Yellen would be the first to say there is more to be done and Treasury continues to work each day to foster a strong and equitable recovery,"" the spokesperson added.By the summer months, discussion — and acknowledgment — of inflation ramped up across the administration, according to multiple current and former officials. Internal estimates began to rise in reflection of that, they said. Private sector estimates rose to 3.7%, while the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve saw inflation closer to 3% by the end of the year. Treasury was coming around to the idea that prices would be going — and perhaps staying — higher than they had forecasted, the official said. For his part, Fed Chairman Powell mentioned in a July 14 congressional hearing that inflation was rising in ""a number of categories of goods and services.""The CEA was beginning to question the underlying thesis, too. A former Fed official recalls White House economist Heather Boushey raising the question about the cause of inflation during one of the monthly lunches during the summer, to wit, if the issue was one of supply — factory closures and transportation logjams and worker shortages limiting the goods that could get to consumers — that would work itself out.But if the issue was demand — confident consumers with money burning a hole in their pocket — that could only be kept in check by the Federal Reserve.   Publicly, the administration was still voicing hope the trend would be short-lived.""Our experts believe and our data shows that most of the price increases we've seen were expected and expected to be temporary,"" Biden said in July. By August, Yellen's definition of ""temporary"" indicated the price increases would subside by the end of the year.  By fall, as persistent inflation began to erode Biden's approval rating, the administration shifted its message. Cabinet officials pounded the pavement, pointing to inflation as a sign the economy had strengthened, effectively implying the Fed might need to act. ""Part of what's happening is not only on the supply side, it's the demand side,"" said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on CNN on Oct. 18. ""Demand is off the charts."" A week later, Yellen, ever aware of choosing careful language on a market-moving issue, laid out a significantly longer timeline for inflation pressures to ease, signaling they wouldn't do so on their own. ""The inflation rate will remain high into next year because of what's already happened,"" Yellen told CNN on Oct. 24. ""But I expect improvement by the end of ... by the middle to end of next year, second half of next year.""While the White House was discussing short-term fixes to the supply chain and gas prices, tackling longer-term inflation falls to the Federal Reserve. But Biden had yet to decide whether he would keep Powell on to lead the Fed after his term expired in early 2022, putting the central bank in an awkward position of confronting a vexing monetary-policy decision without the clarity of who would be carrying it out. Yellen had advocated for a second Powell term, but progressive lawmakers behind the scenes were seeking assurances the Fed board would be refashioned with more liberal economists who would reflect their priorities.  Then, on Nov. 8, Randal Quarles, a Fed governor appointed in 2017 by Trump, announced he would resign from the board 11 years before the end of his term, creating a vacancy that allowed Democrats to make up the majority of the seven-member board. The Quarles resignation served as something of a fulcrum for the shift that followed, though the extent to which is unclear. A person involved in the discussions told CNBC the new vacancy was a factor in the timing of Biden's decision to renominate Powell as chairman. A second person briefed on the matter suggested the resignation was simply a ""convenient rationale"" for a decision that had simply been delayed. The White House disputed any link between Biden's decision and Quarles' resignation. By the time Biden nominated Powell to a second term and Lael Brainard as a vice chair in late November, #Bidenflation was trending on Twitter, and ""transitory"" — the Fed's long-favored descriptor for the inflation trend — was being made into memes. Biden, Powell and Brainard all pledged publicly to tame inflation at the nomination ceremony.In hindsight, current and former administration officials and the two former Fed officials said the administration's best weapon in combating inflation would have been an earlier nomination that empowered the Fed to move sooner.But Powell denies that personnel moves delayed the Fed's pivot toward raising interest rates, which was announced a week after his nomination. He said in a press conference that he and his colleagues set to work on the strategy after parsing the early November data on jobs and inflation, after which several Fed officials publicly called for faster action.""That doesn't happen by accident,"" Powell told reporters on Dec. 15. ""They were out talking about taper before the president made his decision,"" referring to the Fed's move to scale back its bond-purchase program.As Powell awaits confirmation, the White House remains optimistic inflation will ease through a combination of the Fed's now-telegraphed interest rate hikes and an eventual return to normal as the pandemic subsides.White House chief of staff Ron Klain told CNBC that Biden is not considering any personnel changes in the West Wing or Treasury stemming from inflation. The same models that underestimated inflation in 2021 now call for moderation by the end of 2022, right as midterm voters will have their say at the ballot box. Furman, the Obama administration veteran, said he fears inflation will get worse. But he also said the White House is wielding a better tool: realism.  ""One tool they were not using before but they have been for the last couple months is not overpromising,"" Furman said. ""There had been this claim that the inflation was about to go away. Now, they're being much more realistic.""  – CNBC's Steve Liesman and Patrick Manning contributed reporting "
2022-02-07,"Rapidly rising wages are expected to push Federal Reserve interest rate hikes at an even faster pace.Average hourly earnings are running at a 5.7% pace over the past 12 months, near the highest levels in 15 years.Bank of America is sticking to its call for seven rate hikes this year as the Fed looks to control the higher cost of living. Too much of a good thing, in the form of rapidly rising wages, is expected to push Federal Reserve interest rate hikes at an even faster pace.Average hourly earnings jumped 0.7% in January and are now running at a 5.7% pace over the past 12 months, according to Labor Department data released Friday. Excepting a two-month period during the early days of the pandemic, that is by a wide margin the fastest-ever move in data going back to March 2007.While that has come as welcome news to workers, it's posed a further quandary for the Fed, which increasingly is being seen as falling behind in terms of policy and having to catch up to inflation that is running at its fastest pace in nearly 40 years.""If I'm the Fed, I'm getting more nervous that it's not just a few outliers"" that are driving wage increases, Ethan Harris, Bank of America's head of global economics research, said in a media call Monday. ""If I were the Fed chair ... I would have raised rates early in the fall. When we get this broad-based increase and it starts making its way to wages, you're behind the curve and you need to start moving.""BofA and Harris have issued the most aggressive Fed call on Wall Street for this year. The bank's economists see seven quarter-percentage-point rate hikes in 2022, followed by four more next year. Harris said he's not backing off the call, even though markets are currently only giving the scenario an 18% chance of happening, according to CME data.He cites the Fed's new approach to monetary policy that it approved in September 2020. Under what it deemed flexible average inflation targeting, the Fed said it would be willing to allow inflation to run hotter than its 2% target in the interest of achieving full employment.But with inflation running around 7% year-over-year and the labor market getting ever tighter, the Fed now is in the position of playing catch-up.""The problem with the whole approach, and what's got us calling for seven hikes, is the economy's not just hitting the Fed's goals, it's blowing through the stop signs,"" Harris said.Harris points out that wages are surging across virtually all income classes.  Leisure and hospitality, the hardest-hit sector from the pandemic, has seen a 13% earnings gain over the past year. Wages in finance jobs are up 4.8%, while retail trade pay has risen 7.1%.Goldman Sachs sees the push higher as part of the ""Great Resignation,"" a term used to describe the fastest pace of people leaving their jobs in data that goes back to 2001. For all of 2021, workers changed or left jobs 47.4 million times, according to the Labor Department.""The Great Resignation consists of two quite different but connected trends: millions of workers have left the labor force, and millions more have quit their jobs for better, higher-paying opportunities,"" Goldman economists Joseph Briggs and David Mericle said in a note. ""These trends have pushed wage growth to a rate that increasingly raises concern about the inflation outlook.""

The firm expects four rate increases in 2022.""Faster growth of labor costs than is compatible with the 2% inflation goal is likely to keep the FOMC on a consecutive hiking path and raise the risk of a more aggressive response,"" the economists said.Markets have been raising the stakes slowly for the Fed, pricing in five hikes this year but leaving open the possibility for more and at a faster rate. While traders see a quarter-point move coming in March, the possibility of a more aggressive 50 basis point hike has risen to nearly 30%. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point. ""This is how out of date and behind Fed policy is,"" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday. ""So hopefully they can regain the inflation narrative, hopefully they can control the wage narrative. My concern is the market is running away with rate hikes in excess of what the economy can absorb.""BofA's Harris said going 50 basis points would be ""a reasonable thing to do"" though he noted it wouldn't be in keeping with the ""humble"" approach Chairman Jerome Powell espoused during his post-meeting news conference in January.Harris said he actually doesn't think the rate hikes will wreck the economy, so long as the Fed communicates that the moves will be methodical and aimed at controlling inflation, not halting growth. This cycle could resemble the Fed's move in the mid-aughts when it instituted a series of 17 hikes aimed at slowing down the runaway housing market, he added.""I actually think it's not a radical call,"" Harris said of the bank's expectation for 11 hikes through 2023. ""It's just the path of least resistance for a central bank that's starting at zero."""
2022-02-07,"Amazon is more than doubling its maximum base salary for corporate workers, according to an internal memo.The company will now cap its base pay at $350,000, up from its previous max of $160,000.Amazon cited the competitive labor market as one of the factors behind the change. Amazon is boosting its maximum base salary for corporate workers, citing the competitive labor market as one of several factors behind the change.The company said Monday in an internal memo to employees that it will now cap base pay for all white-collar workers at $350,000, a significant jump from its previous max of $160,000.Base pay is only a portion of employees' total compensation. This figure does not include restricted stock units, which typically vest in increments over several years, as well as other cash, such as sign-on bonuses. The company's compensation has historically been weighted heavily to stock.""This past year has seen a particularly competitive labor market, and in doing a thorough analysis of various options, weighing the economics of our business and the need to remain competitive for attracting and retaining top talent, we decided to make meaningfully bigger increases to our compensation levels than we do in a typical year,"" according to the memo, which was first reported by GeekWire.An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the memo, but declined to comment further.In addition to increasing base pay, Amazon said it's also increasing overall compensation ranges for most jobs globally, and ""the increases are much more considerable than we've done in the past,"" according to the memo.The changes come as Amazon has increasingly come under fire from employees for what they see as below-market pay. Base pay was recently labeled as one of the top reasons for employees wanting to depart the company, Business Insider reported last month, citing internal surveys.Competition for labor is more intense than before, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has afforded workers greater leverage to demand better benefits and pay. More and more companies are also offering flexible work arrangements, such as remote or hybrid employment. That's led Amazon and other tech companies to admit that failing to offer those benefits could potentially hurt their ability to attract or retain talent.Amazon did not rank among the top seven employers for engineering pay last year, according to Levels.fyi, which tracks pay in the tech industry. A top-level engineer at Roblox could make more than $1 million, while one at Facebook could pull over $900,000, although these figures include all forms of compensation, not just base pay.WATCH: How the U.S. economy can survive a hybrid workforce"

The comments come a day before the U.S. government is due to release full-year trade data that analysts expect to show a significant shortfall in China's pledge to increase purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services.

But our patience is wearing thin,"" said one of the officials.China continued to engage with U.S. officials on the issue, but Washington was seeking ""concrete action,"" not ""talks for the sake of talking,"" the official added.U.S. officials said they would continue to press China to show ""serious intent"" to reach an agreement on their purchase commitments, but conceded the framework of the deal offered them little leverage to enforce the purchase commitments. Regardless of how the negotiations wind up, U.S. officials said they would continue to target the core problems of China's state-led economy, while working to boost U.S. competitiveness by diversifying markets and working with allies and partners.Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi told a trade conference on Tuesday that China had failed to meet its purchase commitments under the deal and the conversations between Washington and Beijing had been ""very difficult.""The agreement, signed by Trump in January 2020, defused a nearly three-year trade war between the world's two largest economies, but left in place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports on both sides of the Pacific.A spokesperson for China's Embassy in Washington last week said Beijing has worked to implement the Phase 1 agreement ""despite the impact of COVID-19, global recession and supply chain disruptions."""

Last summer heavy rain led to severe flooding in a number of European countries, causing deaths and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.    Climate affects the ""economic growth story"" and requires a response at the local, regional and international level, a climate scientist has told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"".Anders Levermann, who is head of the complexity science research department at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, was speaking after a recent study published in the journal Nature found economic growth falls when the amount of ""wet days and days with extreme rainfall"" increases.Scientists at PIK looked at data from over 1,500 regions between 1979 and 2019. In a statement last month, PIK said the analysis suggested that ""intensified daily rainfall driven by climate-change from burning oil and coal will harm the global economy.""The peer-reviewed study was led by Leonie Wenz, from PIK and the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change.""Economies across the world are slowed down by more wet days and extreme daily rainfall — an important insight that adds to our growing understanding of the true costs of climate change,"" she said.""While more annual rainfall is generally good for economies, especially agriculturally dependent ones, the question is also how the rain is distributed across the days of the year,"" she added.""Intensified daily rainfall turns out to be bad, especially for wealthy, industrialized countries like the US, Japan, or Germany,"" Wenz said. PIK highlighted both the service and manufacturing sectors as being particularly affected.Challenges related to excessive, heavy rain look to be here for the foreseeable future. According to the U.K.'s national meteorological service, the Met Office, as ""global temperatures rise, the number of extreme rainfall days is expected to increase.""Last summer, for example, heavy rain led to severe flooding in a number of European countries, causing deaths as well as significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.   In response to what it called ""catastrophic flooding and heavy rain"", Germany's federal government said it would provide as much as 30 billion euros (around $34.3 billion) to assist parts of the country affected by the flooding.

2022-02-08,"The U.S. Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking published its final report on Tuesday.It revealed that more than 100,000 people died of drug overdoses in the 12 months to June 2021, an increase of 30% from a year earlier.The Commission estimated that drug overdoses are now costing the U.S. around $1 trillion every year.  Fatal opioid overdoses are thought to be costing the U.S. economy $1 trillion each year, government officials have said.In a report published Tuesday by the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking, it was revealed that synthetic opioids — primarily fentanyl — were responsible for almost two in three reported drug overdose deaths in the U.S. in the year to June 2021.More than 100,000 people died of drug overdoses during that period, an increase of 30% from a year earlier, it said. And overdoses have been responsible for more than 1 million deaths in the U.S. since 1999, according to the report — that's more than double the number caused by firearms or car accidents.The U.S. Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking includes representatives from several federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Four members were appointed from the Senate and the House of Representatives.""In 2018, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, the cost of overdose fatalities was $696 billion, despite being roughly two-thirds of annual overdose deaths today,"" the commission said in its report.""It is therefore reasonable to estimate that drug overdoses are now costing the United States approximately $1 trillion annually.""According to the report, this ""staggering amount"" predominantly arose from the lost productivity caused by early deaths, as well as health care and criminal justice costs.

The Commission also recommended increasing access to treatment for addiction, and collaborating with other countries involved in the production and distribution of synthetic opioids.The Council on Foreign Relations has called the epidemic one of the United States' worst-ever drug crises. According to the CFR, more than 1,300 people per week die from opioid-related overdoses, while millions more Americans suffer from opioid addiction. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, rising rates of fatal opioid overdoses were responsible for reducing life expectancies in the United States. Life expectancies for Americans declined again in 2020, which was largely attributed to the pandemic, but opioid-related deaths also played a part.According to Tuesday's report, substance abuse and opioid-related fatalities surged as the pandemic set in.""Shockingly, the number of overdose deaths in the United States has risen exponentially since 1979 and does not appear to be dropping any time soon,"" it said.""Since 1999, we've lost more than one million Americans to drug overdoses. That's one million moms, dads, sons, and daughters lost because our country's response to the opioid epidemic has failed,"" said Rep. David Trone, co-chair of the Commission, in a press release on Tuesday.Co-chair Sen. Tom Cotton added that 274 Americans die every day from drug overdoses — that's one person every five minutes, ""and every day it gets worse.""Congressman Fred Upton, also a member of the Commission, called for authorities to crack down on Mexican drug cartels, and said the U.S. must ""force China's hand to crackdown on their pharmaceutical industry supplying cartels with the base compounds used to manufacture synthetic opioids."""
2022-02-08,"For serious ski enthusiasts, the spectacular slopes of Lebanon are a particular draw.For those with a more adventurous spirit, Pakistan in the wider region has several incredible ski resorts.Saudi Arabia is about to get what's described as the largest indoor ski slope and snow dome in the world. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Skiing in the desert might sound absurd, but in the heart of one of Dubai's busiest shopping destinations, Mall of the Emirates, this adrenaline-pumping pastime has been going strong since 2005.It's technically not real snow at Ski Dubai of course, yet this wintry wonderland remains hugely popular with tourists and residents who enjoy speeding down a 1,300-ft-long slope – or indeed tobogganing, bobsledding, ziplining, zorb balling, and hanging out with penguins.Boasting ""fresh"" snow all year long, the park is chilled to -24.8 degrees Fahrenheit and has even been named the world's best indoor ski resort for six years in a row, including this year.And in a region known for one-upmanship, Saudi Arabia is about to get what's described as the largest indoor ski slope and snow dome in the world at the massive new Mall of Saudi, currently under construction.With a reported 40,000 square meter indoor snow slope, the Kingdom will be adding to several other ""snow experience"" centers, including Snow City in Riyadh. These unabashedly unsustainable snow-in-the-desert resorts remain controversial due to the eye-watering energy intensity of what are essentially huge refrigerators. But aside from these types of mega-scale artificial venues, the Middle East is working hard to build on its winter sport offering to attract tourists looking for something a bit different.For serious ski enthusiasts, the spectacular slopes of Lebanon are a particular draw due to scenic mountains covered by the white stuff from December to April. Although Lebanon's winter sports season was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, mammoth resorts like Mzaar are back and thriving thanks to recent heavy snowfall and sensible Covid restrictions in place to reassure guests such as masking in busy areas and some social distancing. With 62 miles of terrain, the resort is home to some challenging slopes, while also offering plenty of runs for beginners and intermediate skiers.For those with a more adventurous spirit, Pakistan in the wider region has several incredible ski resorts and mountain ranges that can compete with anywhere in the world in terms of ""wow"" factor.One hidden gem — the Naltar Ski Resort in the Gilgit–Baltistan region in the extreme north of the country — boasts Pakistan's highest chairlift and hosts major ski, ice hockey and snowboarding competitions. Naltar itself is a picturesque pine-scented village known for its wildlife and magnificent mountain scenery.Turkey too has bountiful snow in the winter months, notably at Mount Erciyes which is part of a larger ski area that totals around 95 miles. The ski center here has the nearby town of Kayseri which has a plenty of top-notch hotels, such as the swanky five-star Radisson Blu.There's no snow park or terrain park at Mount Erciyes, but the resort is covered by 80% artificial snowmaking, so it's a snow-sure winter fun destination. The area is also ideal for snow-kiting due to having big open planes that stretch for miles. Back in the United Arab Emirates, as the country tries to move away from oil and toward tourism as its main economic driver, there's a surge in new attractions aimed at pulling in global sports lovers over the winter months by offering top facilities for activities more traditionally enjoyed in the spring and summer.A good example is the Meydan Hotel Dubai, which sits close to famous equestrian hotspot, the Meydan Racecourse. It has launched the Tennis 360 academy, serving up a raft of facilities such as eight floodlit courts – including a championship court – as well as three padel courts and two beach tennis courts.""We continue to bring new, world-class attractions to The Meydan Hotel, and look forward to a long and successful partnership with Tennis 360, which has opened as the winter sports season gets under way,"" Mohamed Shawky, hotel manager at The Meydan Hotel, told local media.This month Dubai is also about to open EmiratesPadPro, the largest padbol facility in the world – padbol being a cross between soccer, tennis, volleyball and squash. Ever quick to capitalize on a hot trend, Dubai is looking to latch on to the booming global padsports scene by offering this impressive home for it in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Hussein Kapasi, co-founder of Emirates PadPro, says they are focused on attracting a new generation of sports enthusiasts during winter and highlighting the appeal of the regional climate.""The Middle East is known for sunny skies and dry cooler months without rain and snow which is ideal for anyone looking to play sports outdoors at ease without worrying about the weather or transport, as the roads are clear and safe for everyone,"" he told CNBC.Tourism in general currently looks promising for the region, even with Covid still in play. Before the pandemic, the Middle East's travel and tourism sector's contribution to their economies was an impressive $270 billion, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.Covid may have brought things to a standstill in 2020, but by the end of 2021 Middle East tourism was pulling ahead of other regions — such as Europe and Latin America — with a year-on-year increase of $36 billion to its economy, the World Travel and Tourism Council also reported."
2022-02-09,"Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he anticipates hiking interest rates three or four times this year.However, he noted that ""every option is on the table"" when it comes to the central bank's battle against inflation.Markets expect the Fed to hike rates at least five times this year. Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he anticipates hiking interest rates three or four times this year, but he stressed that the central bank isn't locked into a specific plan.Speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" the policymaker signaled a view that is less aggressive than the market's on rates.""In terms of hikes for the interest rates, right now I have three forecast for this year,"" he said. ""I'm leaning a little towards four, but we're going to have to see how the economy responds as we take our first steps through the first part of this year.""Market pricing currently is anticipating at least five and possibly six hikes of 0.25 percentage points each. Bank of America recently forecast seven moves as the central bank fights inflation running at its highest level in nearly 40 years.In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Bostic garnered some attention when he said the first move might have to be 0.5 percentage points, or 50 basis points. The Fed has signaled that it likely will enact its first rate hike in more than three years at its March meeting.Bostic did not commit in his CNBC interview to moving that quickly.""For me, I'm thinking very much of a 25-basis-point perspective,"" he said. ""But I want everyone to understand that every option is on the table, and I don't want people to have the view that we're locked into a particular trajectory in terms of how our rates have to move over time. We're really going to let the data show us to what extent a 50 basis point or 25 basis point move is appropriate.""In a separate appearance Wednesday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she's expecting a rate hike in March though she did not commit to the pace at which she'd be comfortable.""While the Omicron variant may weigh on activity in the near term, the high levels of inflation and the tightness in labor markets make a compelling case to begin recalibrating the stance of monetary policy.,"" she said in a speech for the European Economics and Financial Center. ""Barring an unexpected turn in the economy, I support beginning to remove accommodation by moving the funds rate up in March."" Bostic's comments come the day before the Labor Department will release its latest inflation reading as gauged by January's consumer price index. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the 12-month pace to run at 7.2%, which would be the fastest since early 1982.However, Bostic said he's more concerned with the monthly acceleration, which is projected at 0.4%, or slightly slower than December.If the monthly rate can continue to moderate, that would be a signal that inflation is coming under control and the Fed won't have to be as hawkish.He does, though, think the Fed can start pulling back on its easy policy. Along with cutting its benchmark short-term borrowing rate to near-zero, the central has been buying billions of bonds each month, an operation that has ballooned its total asset holdings to just shy of $9 trillion.Markets widely expect the Fed to allow proceeds from those holdings to start running off soon, with the only question being how much the balance sheet will shrink. Bostic said he thinks the early stages can be aggressive.Bostic added that he remains positive on growth through the year and doesn't think the Fed will have to deploy measures to slow the economy. ""The first part of the reduction I think we can do pretty significantly,"" he said. ""I think that we should really be looking into ways to remove that excess liquidity that the market has shown us exists so that we can then get into decisions about what the use of the balance sheet should look like in terms of a menu of tightening our policy.""Mester said she also thinks the Fed can be aggressive in cutting the balance sheet. She supports an approach in which the central bank would engage in outright sales of its $2.7 trillion in mortgage-backed securities to the point where the Fed's holdings would consist exclusively of Treasurys, of which it currently holds $5.7 trillion."
2022-02-09,"Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said the central bank will be prepared to hike rates at any meeting.Mester added she favors an aggressive reduction in the Fed's balance sheet, which she said should include outright sales of mortgage-backed securities. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester laid out an aggressive plan for reducing easy-money policies this year, saying the central bank will be ready to hike rates at any meeting and should be looking at shedding mortgage-backed securities it is holding.""Each meeting is going to be in play,"" Mester said Wednesday at a virtual event hosted by the European Economics and Financial Centre. ""We're going to assess conditions, we're going to assess how the economy's evolving, we're going to be looking at the risks, and we're going to be removing accommodation.""Her comments come with markets widely expecting the Fed to raise its benchmark short-term borrowing rate at its March meeting. Traders are pricing in at least four more increases through the course of the year.Mester said she sees a March hike lately but doesn't expect to raise the rate by more than 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point, as is the norm. But she was emphatic that it's time for the central bank to start reversing the historically accommodative measures it took during the Covid pandemic crisis.""I don't like taking anything off the table,"" she said. ""I don't think there's any compelling case to start with a 50 basis point [increase]. Again, we've got to be a little bit careful. Even though you can well telegraph what's coming, when you take that first action, there's going to be a reaction.""Mester is a voting member this year of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates and other monetary policy measures. She noted she will be watching inflation closely. If it declines over the course of the year, that would lead to fewer rate hikes, while an acceleration would prompt more hawkish action.

The central bank's total balance sheet is close to $9 trillion, having doubled during the pandemic.The Fed is likely to allow some of the proceeds from its holdings to roll off each month while reinvesting the rest. However, Mester advocated a more active approach, in which the Fed would sell outright some of the $2.66 trillion in mortgage-backed securities it is holding.In the last balance sheet reduction, which ran from 2017 to 2019, it used a passive roll-off.Like other officials, Mester noted the conditions are different this time: The holdings are far larger and the economy is in a stronger position, so the balance sheet reduction can be done more quickly.She advocated that the central bank shed its mortgage holdings and focus on the Treasury market.""I do think it's important that the Fed not be allocating its credit to particular sectors,"" Mester said.The Fed's monthly asset purchases have been cut back to $60 billion and are expected to end completely by March. Market opinion is coalescing around the balance sheet reduction beginning in the summer.Earlier in the day, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic also called for several rate hikes this year and a quick reduction of the balance sheet holdings."
2022-02-09,"Italy is facing higher debt costs as the ECB looks to tighten its monetary policy.Investors are focused on the Italian growth and fiscal outlook.Political fragmentation is a key concern when assessing the future of the Italian economy. An eventual result in Italy's presidential elections may have averted political instability for now, but market watchers are wary over the economic and political future of Europe's third-largest economy.The yield on the Italian 10-year government bond traded at 1.8680% late Tuesday afternoon — up around 5 basis points and building on the gains seen Monday. The rate on the benchmark bond is at its highest since April 2020, meaning the Italian government is now facing higher costs when raising funds from public markets — which could ultimately become an economic headache for Rome.""The peripheral bond market needs to adjust to the reality of a world without ECB QE [quantitative easing],"" Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, said in a note to clients on Tuesday.One reason for this week's moves in European debt markets is the increased expectation that the European Central Bank will tighten monetary policy during 2022, with a possible rate rise later this year. Any rate hike would be the first since 2011, when the bank was criticized for moving too early in a time of great financial stress.The 19 nation euro zone, of which Italy is a member, has seen loose monetary policy since the sovereign debt crisis of 2011 with billions pumped into its economy to stimulate lending and boost economic activity. As the region's outlook was starting to improve in 2019, it was then hit by the coronavirus pandemic and the ECB subsequently launched a new bond-buying program.This included purchasing even more government bonds across the euro area, so nations would face lower costs when raising new debt.""In 2020-21, the Bank of Italy bought over 100% of net supply of Italian central government debt. In 2022, we estimate that the central bank will buy up to 60% of net issuance. In 2023, this source of demand will be gone,"" Ducrozet said, highlighting the changing landscape for monetary policy.As a result, he added: ""The growth and fiscal outlook will be key"" for Italy. An additional problem for Italy is its parliament, which often experiences huge political fragmentation, impacting its growth and fiscal outlook.It's ""clear that party heads do not have a strong control over their parties. That's what makes me nervous,"" Gilles Moec, group chief economist at AXA Investment Managers, told CNBC Monday.Indeed, political fragmentation is so acute right now that lawmakers recently took eight attempts to elect a new president. After nearly a week of inconclusive voting, lawmakers decided to ask Sergio Mattarella to continue as the country's president — despite him wanting to leave the job.""The duo Mattarella-Draghi may provide a backstop in the short run, but Italy's prospects in the medium-long term remain highly uncertain,"" Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of the consultancy firm Teneo, said in a note to clients last week. Mario Draghi, who has been serving as the country's prime minister for a year, has brought stability to the nation. He has put together a plan on how to invest almost 200 billion euros ($228.6 billion) of European pandemic recovery funds while keeping the support of the main political parties.However, Draghi's mandate comes to an end in the spring of 2023 — when new parliamentary elections are due.There's now key questions on whether Draghi, a former ECB president, will manage to keep implementing much-needed reforms before the end of his mandate. Political parties will soon start to lay the ground for their election campaigns and, more broadly, an election will undoubtedly bring uncertainty on what sort of coalition will emerge after the vote.""While a stronger leadership by Draghi is a necessary condition to keep the demons of Italian politics under control, it is not sufficient to keep the country on track over time,"" Piccoli said. Opinion polls project a very divided Parliament in Rome in the wake of next year's election. The center-left party Partito Democratico and the far-right Fratelli d'Italia have the same backing in current polls, at around 21%. The anti-immigration Lega party follows with 18% of the votes, and the left-leaning Five Star Movement stands in fourth with about 14% of the support. This is according to data collected by Politico.This suggests the next election will be a very tight race and there are different coalition formats are possible. Investors will be interested to know what are the chances that Rome keeps implementing the necessary economic reforms to receive the massive European recovery funds, which will be critical to boost the Italian economy.""Markets will be very vigilant of that,"" Gilles Moec from AXA Investment Managers said.However, it is unclear the level of commitment by some of the parties to implement the reforms that Draghi agreed to with the EU.""Well, I don't see why (Italy's economy should be at risk),"" Francesco Lollobrigida, Parliamentary Leader for Brothers of Italy told CNBC in Rome, when asked if his party understood the economic risks of not reforming.""Italy is not a country that the EU can do without. A strong Italy is also useful for a strong Europe. So the two things must happen in parallel,"" he said.Europe's massive recovery plan is highly dependent on Italy. This is because Rome is receiving the highest amount than any other EU nation within this program. Failure to reform and get those funds would question Europe's efficiency in implementing its targets. --CNBC's Anita Riotta contributed to this article."
2022-02-10,"Bundesbank Governor Joachim Nagel became the second central banker in the last few days to indicate that the ECB may raise rates later this year.The commission estimated that annual inflation in the euro area will rise from 2.6% in 2021 to 3.5% in 2022, to then come down to 1.7% in 2023.The outlook for inflation, but also for the overall economy in Europe, is also dependent on tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The European Commission on Thursday raised its inflation expectations for this year, but is still expecting prices to move below the European Central Bank's target of 2% in 2023.The Brussels-based institution said inflation will hit 3.5% this year from a November forecast of 2.2%.The debate over inflation in the 19-member bloc is fierce. On the one hand, some argue that current inflationary pressures will ease and a degree of loose monetary policy is needed. Others counter that the ECB needs to tighten monetary policy after consecutive historic monthly highs in inflation.Bundesbank Governor Joachim Nagel became the second central banker in the last few days to indicate that the ECB may raise rates later this year.However, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said Thursday that inflationary pressures are likely to come down next year.""After reaching a record rate of 4.6% in the fourth quarter of last year, inflation in the euro area is projected to peak at 4.8% in the first quarter of 2022 and remain above 3% until the third quarter of the year,"" the commission said in a statement.""As the pressures from supply constraints and high energy prices fade, inflation is expected to decline to 2.1% in the final quarter of the year, before moving below the European Central Bank's 2% target throughout 2023,"" the institution added.As such, the commission estimated that annual inflation in the euro area will rise from 2.6% in 2021 to 3.5% in 2022, before then falling to 1.7% in 2023. These numbers, however, point to an upward revision in the ECB's own inflation forecasts at its next meeting in March.Market participants will be closely following the meeting to understand whether the ECB will cut its bond-buying program or adjust any other terms of its policy. Whatever the central bank decides to do could have a massive impact on the recovery of the euro zone economies, some of which were particularly hit by the pandemic.Speaking to CNBC Thursday, European Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni noted that institutions were currently considering whether inflation will be more persistent than previously estimated, adding that he is ""confident"" on the decisions that the ECB will take.However, he said loose monetary policy is one of the key factors that will keep supporting the euro zone recovery this year.""We are still in an environment of negative rates and very good financing conditions for our economy, and this is one of the fundamentals that can support a good level of growth for the next months,"" he said. The outlook for inflation, but also for the overall economy in Europe, is also dependent on tensions between Ukraine and Russia.""Risks to the growth and inflation outlook are markedly aggravated by geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe,"" the commission said in a statement.Speaking to CNBC last month, Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe also warned that these geopolitical risks could have a significant economic impact.Europe is highly reliant on natural gas from Russia, some of which arrives via pipelines in Ukraine. Any escalation in the tensions could impact the usual flows of gas and push up costs, which would drive inflation even higher."
2022-02-10,"Even though the Federal Reserve is about to embark on an inflation-fighting strategy, the impact won't be felt for months or longer.Monetary policy works with a lag, which means it takes time for rate moves to circulate through the economy.The Fed has no direct way of lowering the cost of a loaf of bread at the grocery store or a fast-food burger or even a gallon of gas. Folks tired of paying higher prices for pretty much everything shouldn't expect help anytime soon from the Federal Reserve.Even though the central bank is about to embark on an inflation-fighting strategy, the impact won't be felt for months or longer, economists say.That's because the Fed can't order prices to go lower. All it can do is tighten up the money supply and trust that things will go well from there. The central bank does that through interest rate hikes, which are expected to start up in March and — ultimately — bring down the cost of living.""What it will do is it will limit the persistence of price increases,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, an accounting service. ""The expectation that we should all have is the action the Fed takes today really won't be apparent until the fourth quarter of this year and all of next year.""Anticipation of Fed action comes as the latest consumer price index reading, which measures the cost of dozens of everyday goods and services, grew 7.5% over the past year in January. That's the fastest rise since 1982, when the economy was dealing with stagflation and a double-dip recession.Prices rose across the board. In December alone, cereal increased 1.8%, ham was up 2.5% and fresh fish prices jumped 2.4%. That's on top of ongoing surges in food, energy and housing. In an effort to address the problem, markets expect the Fed at its March meeting to raise benchmark borrowing rates by at least 0.25 percentage points, and perhaps double that. Wall Street figures the Fed to hike rates at least five more times after that before the end of 2022.But monetary policy works with a lag, which means it takes time for rate moves to circulate through the economy. Economists believe it's six months to a year before those efforts really take effect.""The Federal Reserve cannot do anything about the current surge in inflation in the near term,"" Brusuelas said.Over the longer term, though, rate hikes have proven to be an effective way to curb inflation. The way it works is that higher rates make it less affordable to borrow money, so that slows credit. At the same time, the higher cost of money feeds into the dollar, raising the U.S. currency's value and providing consumers more purchasing power.If that sounds kind of squishy, there's a reason for that. The Fed has no direct way of lowering the cost of a loaf of bread at the grocery store or a fast-food burger or even a gallon of gas, which has gotten 40% more expensive over the past 12 months.There's another problem: This is not your garden-variety inflation cycle, which is generally driven by big jumps in credit. Instead, much of the current situation has come thanks to unprecedented infusions of cash that flowed directly from the federal government through pandemic-related payments to households, and indirectly from the Fed and the amount of money it has pumped into the economy through lending and liquidity programs, along with near-zero short-term interest rates.""We are in an asset cycle and not a credit cycle,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard. ""The inflation that we're seeing is a function of these one-time infusions of equity into households and small-business balance sheets. The money was spent, and it was spent at a time when the ability to supply that demand was constrained.""Indeed, until recently Fed officials had been using the word ""transitory"" to describe inflation that came about through pandemic-related factors such as surging demand for goods over services and constraints to supply chains triggered by the Covid spread.But price increases have proven more aggressive and durable than policymakers anticipated.After months of writing off inflation as a passing phase, Fed officials now must take delayed action that will feed into the economy but through indirect channels.""The only way the Fed can slow this is through a stronger dollar lowering the cost of imports,"" Blitz said. ""It not only lowers the cost of imports. It also raises the cost of producing goods elsewhere outside the U.S. and that lowers labor demand.""The conundrum for the Fed will be in making sure the cure isn't worse than the disease, that its inflation-fighting rate cuts don't send the economy reeling and hurt the people at the lower end of the income spectrum that the aggressive spending policies were aimed at helping.""Can the Fed bring down inflation? Yes, it absolutely can,"" Blitz said. ""But the question is, what happens next? It's a question of time."""
2022-02-10,"President Joe Biden on Thursday touted wage growth and forecasts for weaker inflation even after a new report showed that prices are rising at their fastest clip in 40 years.""While today's report is elevated, forecasters continue to project inflation easing substantially by the end of 2022,"" Biden said in a press release. Biden's remarks came about two hours after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose 7.5% in the 12 months through January. President Joe Biden on Thursday touted wage growth and forecasts for tapering inflation even after a new report showed that prices are still rising at their fastest clip in 40 years.""While today's report is elevated, forecasters continue to project inflation easing substantially by the end of 2022,"" Biden said in a press release. ""And fortunately we saw positive real wage growth last month, and moderation in auto prices, which have made up about a quarter of headline inflation over the last year.""""We will continue to fight for costs in areas that have held back families and working people for decades, from prescription drugs to child care and elder care to their energy costs,"" he added. The president's remarks came about two hours after the Labor Department reported that prices facing U.S. consumers rose 7.5% in the 12 months through January, the hottest annualized pace since 1982. Excluding volatile gas and grocery costs, the CPI increased 6%, compared with the estimate of 5.9%. Core inflation rose at its fastest level since August 1982.Inflation has over the past several months evolved into one of the administration's chief economic problems as rising prices at the gas pump and at the grocery store chip away at Americans' wallets. Without proportional wage increases, inflation erodes consumers' purchasing power and leaves households with lower real incomes.The White House has limited powers at its disposal to curb price increases, including tapping the strategic petroleum reserve, shoring up U.S. supply chains and encouraging workers to return to work as soon as possible.While investments in American infrastructure supported by the Biden administration may work to lower prices in the long term, the White House doesn't have many options to check prices in the near term. Instead, Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have in recent weeks said they agree with the Federal Reserve's likely move to tighten monetary policy and raise interest rates to keep inflation at bay.

2022-02-11,"Valentine's Day is almost here, and marriage is all the rage. According to the Wedding Report, there will be some 2.5 million weddings this year — the most since 1984.As an economist, I'm all for it: Marriage beats partnering long-term. I'm no expert on how to meet the love of your life; my goal is to make sure that you barter for a spouse or partner understanding the economic resources and financial obligations that you each bring to the table. Yes, bartering for love sounds heartless, but it's on full display on America's 1,500 dating apps and websites.  I'm not claiming that money is the only deciding factor in pairing up. For most of us, love transcends money.But we humans have the capacity to fall in love with lots of people. And there's no shame in targeting your swooning on someone who can provide you with a higher standard of living.Put it this way: If two people are the same in most respects, except one earns twice as much as the other, don't flip a coin. Go for the higher earner, and yes, marry for money. You won't be the first to play the oldest financial trick in the book.Choosing to marry over partnering long-term may mean somewhat higher net taxes, but it comes with an array of valuable implicit insurance arrangements, which the formality and legality of marriage help enforce. On top of short-term financial benefits of marrying, like the implicit joining of resources, there are long-term benefits, as well.First, after just nine months, you're eligible to collect future widow(er) Social Security benefits. Plus, after one year of marriage, you and your spouse are eligible to collect future spousal benefits. And if you stay married for 10 years, you're eligible for divorced spousal and divorced widow(er) benefits.But, to be clear, with the way Social Security's benefits formulas work, the spousal benefit will be useful only to spouses who earn very little in absolute terms and also earn a lot less than their marital partner.The widow(er) benefit, on the other hand, can be of tremendous value to the lower-earning spouse (or divorced person), provided the higher-earning spouse (or ex-spouse) dies first. Marriage can also benefit your long-term standard of living, albeit to a highly imperfect and uncertain extent, if you're awarded alimony in divorce.An estimated 41% of all first marriages will end in divorce or separation, according to data from California-based law firm Wilkinson & Finkbeiner. Some 60% of second marriages go south, while 73% of third marriages will start with ""forever"" and end with ""sayonara.""Yet, we all marry convinced we'll make it. Economists call this phenomenon ""irrational expectations"" — when people collectively believe in something they know is collectively false.But wishful thinking about marriage comes at an awful price. Many marriages end in exorbitantly costly divorce war, with children forced to take sides and family ties shredded forever.Maybe it's time to reset our idea of marriage from a lifetime partnership to a temporary arrangement that should be celebrated for lasting as long as it does, not lamented for coming apart. Take the case of hypothetical Sally, who wants her spouse-to-be, Sam, to stay home with the kids while she pursues her lifetime dream of being a contractor. Sally is a go-getter. Her plan is to borrow $1 million, construct and sell a dream house, and use it to showcase her talents.The problem, from Sam's perspective, is that fulfilling Sally's dream means giving up his career. Plus, if they split and the house sells for $500,000, Sam will get stuck with $250,000 in ""their"" debt.Moreover, Sally wants to live in Texas, which is far less generous in providing alimony than, say, Massachusetts. So, if Sally's career takes off, but she takes off with the tile subcontractor, Sam will reap precious little from his investment.If Sally and Sam marry without resolving this potential conflict, Sam may get cold feet and file for divorce before he co-signs the construction loan. But what if they sign a prenup that assigns, upon divorce, all construction debts to Sally, but provides Sam half the profits if Sally's company succeeds for, say, 20 years?This lets Sally take her shot while protecting Sam.Despite the clear benefit of prenups, not signing one is a huge mistake that many people make. Whatever financial concerns would be addressed in a prenup will inevitably arise once you get married.It's far better to negotiate in advance how things will be settled than have one party feel they have, in getting married, lost bargaining power in making financial decisions that could damage them in the context of divorce.My advice? When you kneel down and propose, take two things out of your pocket – a sparkling diamond ring and a leather-bound prenup, which will surely be worth far more than its weight in gold.Laurence J.

LONDON — The British economy grew 7.5% in 2021, official figures revealed Friday, rebounding from its historic 9.4% plunge in 2020 when pandemic restrictions stifled activity.On a quarterly basis, U.K. GDP (gross domestic product) is estimated to have increased by 1% in the final three months of the year. It follows a downwardly revised 1% increase the previous quarter, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Friday.In December, GDP contracted by 0.2% as the omicron Covid-19 variant forced renewed caution and containment measures, though economists polled by Reuters had expected a more severe 0.6% contraction.The largest contributors to the quarterly rise in output were from ""human health and social work activities driven by increased GP visits at the start of the quarter,"" according to the ONS, along with a ""large increase in coronavirus (Covid-19) testing and tracing activities and the extension of the vaccination programme.""The ONS said economic output in the fourth quarter remained 0.4% below its pre-pandemic level (in the fourth quarter of 2019).""The UK's self-imposed lockdown to 'protect Christmas' has turned out to have only a mild impact on growth in December. This is an encouraging sign for the health of the economy,"" said Emma Mogford, fund manager of the Premier Miton Monthly Income Fund.Though the omicron variant did not present the significant setback initially feared in November, the U.K. economy faces a raft of challenges in 2022.The Bank of England now expects inflation to peak at 7.2% in April and has imposed back-to-back interest rate hikes for the first time since 2004, taking the main Bank Rate from 0.1% to 0.5%, with more tightening expected.Meanwhile, the country's energy regulator has increased its price cap by £693 ($938) per year from April 1 because of soaring energy prices, placing further strain on millions of households.The Bank of England also slashed its GDP growth forecasts last week, cautioning that the impact of inflation means the economy is likely to grow 3.75% in 2022 instead of the 5% it previously projected.""The cost of living has become a big concern for millions of people and if it continues for a sustained period of time, it will be harmful to the wider economy,"" said Annabelle Williams, personal finance specialist at British online investment management firm Nutmeg."

BEIJING — The worst of China's regulatory crackdown is over as Beijing shifts its focus to supporting growth, economists said.That does not mean the end of regulation — which has swept across internet technology, real estate and other industries in the last year — but signals fewer major changes ahead, the analysts said.China's economy slowed to 4% year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter, despite expanding by 8.1% for the full year. Sluggish consumer spending dragged down growth, while a slew of regulatory developments added to businesses' uncertainty on top of the coronavirus pandemic.Chinese leaders' new priority for 2022 is to defend 5% growth, Macquarie's chief China economist Larry Hu said in a note late Wednesday. That means ""peak anti-monopoly, peak property tightening and peak decarbonization are all behind us.""""Peak regulation means fewer and less intensive regulation changes this year, as the focus on regulation last year has given way to a focus on growth,"" Hu added in an email. ""Put differently, it means that the worst is over, but not a reversion to the past.""In 2021, Beijing cracked down on alleged monopolistic behavior by internet giants such as Alibaba, real estate property developers' high reliance on debt and regional failures to reduce carbon emissions. Abrupt changes disrupted business, notably in factory power cuts and mass job losses at after-school tutoring centers. But in the last few months, official statements point to a softening in Beijing's stance, analysts said.""As one senior official, Han Wenxiu, said in December, the government will refrain from launching policies that have negative impact on economic growth,"" Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in an email Thursday. ""President Xi [Jinping] also published an article which reiterated the importance of digital economy. I'd expect the government to focus on economic stability this year.""Zhang doesn't anticipate a reversal of regulations, just fewer major changes. His question is ""how and when the government will implement the policies they already announced last year, such as the property tax pilot program and the registration based IPO reform.""Announcements this week added to signals on how Beijing would reduce its rigidity.Top leaders in December had already removed references to anti-monopoly, property policy and carbon neutrality from a list of economic tasks for 2022, Macquarie's Hu said. Then on Monday, China's top economic planning agency and two ministries delayed the target year for the steel industry to reach peak carbon emissions by five years to 2030.The extra five years can reduce the burden on steelmakers by allowing them to spread out investments in decarbonization and avoid large capital expenditures in the short term, Moody's analysts said in a note Wednesday.They don't expect the change to affect the nation's goal of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030. ""The government will continue to implement strict control over steel capacity and production while encouraging environmentally-friendly projects,"" the analysts said. ""Such efforts, along with the extension, will also help support stability in steel supply and prices.""

What to know about the new investing landscape On Tuesday, the People's Bank of China announced loans for affordable rental housing would not count toward the limited amount banks can lend to the property sector, freeing up more capital to support the real estate industry. That same day, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, published an editorial stating that while rules on the use of capital are needed to reduce monopolistic behavior, among others, the economy still needs capital for growth.Beijing's crackdown on alleged monopolistic behavior has particularly targeted internet technology companies like Alibaba that are listed in the U.S. This and other policy developments since Chinese ride-hailing company Didi listed in New York in late June have given international investors pause on putting money into the country.The People's Daily article ""suggests regulatory curbs on the internet sector will stay in place, but will likely become more rules based, with fading uncertainty as the regulatory framework takes shape,"" Bruce Pang, head of strategy and macro research at China Renaissance, said in a note Tuesday.Regulation in line with political themes such as common prosperity — moderate wealth for all, rather than a few — and sustainable development will remain, Pang said. But ""we think the authorities have begun to carefully manage the pace and intensity of the regulatory campaign in order to complete major economic and social development targets set for the next 5-10 years.""He noted how Chinese officials have started to communicate better with the market about the motives and reasons for regulation as well as areas of future government scrutiny. ""Investor concerns may be driven less by the substance of proposed regulations and more by communication,"" he said.The Shanghai composite is up more than 3% this week — the first trading week of the month due to a holiday — after falling by more than 7.5% in January. The Hang Seng Index is up more than 4% this month after gains of 1.7% in January.KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) — a U.S.-listed exchange traded fund that includes Chinese stocks listed abroad — plunged by more than 50% last year amid regulatory uncertainty. The ETF is up 5.4% so far in 2022. Peak regulation is certainly not the end of regulation, Macquarie's Hu said in his report. He pointed to a similar regulatory peak at the end of 2018, which served as a turning point for a sell-off in mainland Chinese stocks, even though local governments and businesses continued to act.China's government system often means local authorities vie for Beijing's attention through sometimes extreme implementation measures. Official language from central government directives then often warns against ""blindly"" shutting down a line of business.For 2022, Beijing has emphasized stability above all. In the second half of the year, the ruling Chinese Communist Party is set to hold a meeting for determining top leadership positions — including the expected extension of President Xi Jinping's term beyond that of his predecessors.The political pressure for stability comes after a year in which the Party celebrated its 100th anniversary. The country meanwhile had an economy bouncing back fast enough from the pandemic to withstand what analysts have called painful but necessary changes to address longstanding problems.Now, growth is slowing as China also tackles fresh coronavirus outbreaks.""The regulatory wave in 2020-21 brought many unintended consequences,"" Hu said. ""For instance, business confidence weakened, the property sector plunged, and commodity prices surged.""""The consequence of [Beijing's] campaign-style is that things could easily be overdone. As the result, top leaders would have to fine-tune from time to time, decide the time to claim victory and move on to the next campaign,"" Hu said. ""It happened so many times over the past one hundred years, and will continue to happen in the future."""

""In the period ahead, there remained a need to closely monitor developments of global energy prices and domestic goods and services prices, as well as the possibility of growing wage pressures,"" the central bank said.

We have very high levels of foreign reserves, low levels of external debt and our current account is pretty much in balance,"" the governor noted. The Fed has indicated it could soon raise interest rates for the first time in more than three years as part of a broader tightening of easy monetary policy. Major central banks around the world slashed interest rates during the worst of pandemic in a bid to stimulate growth as Covid-19 took a toll, but the Fed has since signaled that it is preparing to raise rates again.""The kind of stress that comes from the tightening of global financial conditions on that front — I think we have quite a bit of wiggle room relative to other emerging market economies,"" he added.Still, risks remain as the country's economic recovery remains fragile and uncertain, according to the governor. ""A lot of our recovery is contingent upon what happens in terms of our tourism recovery,"" said Suthiwartnarueput.He said the government was also concerned about future variants of Covid.""If a new variant comes out sometime during winter, which is close to the tourism high season, that would be… the kind of risks that we're concerned,"" he added. According to the Thai central bank, the number of foreign tourist arrivals in December — particularly those from Europe — accelerated from the previous month, after seasonal adjustment.

2022-02-14,"  Inflation has taken hold of Main Street, with an increasing number of small business owners saying it will not relent over the next six months and raising prices to offset increases in the costs of supplies, according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey.President Biden’s approval rating is underwater, and though the small business community skews conservative and the vast majority of liberals surveyed continue to support Biden, support among Democrats ticked down this quarter, and confidence in the Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation is low.The overall CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Confidence Index score continues to hover around all-time lows, though it remained unchanged from Q4 2021. The latest Consumer Price Index reading, the highest in four decades, isn't the only sign that inflation is extending rather than giving up its hold over the U.S. economy in 2022. An increasing number of American small businesses say they are now passing on higher costs to customers, or soon will be forced to make that decision.While the 74% of small business owners who say they are experiencing rising costs of supplies is virtually unchanged from Q4 2021, according to a new CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, the number of businesses passing on costs to customers has risen to 47% in the first quarter, up from 39% in Q4 2021. And another 32% indicate they will have to raise prices soon if inflation persists. Sticky inflation is their expectation. Over eighty percent of small business owners expect inflation to still be a problem six months from now (55% say that is ""very likely""), according to the CNBC|SurveyMonkey data.The Main Street concerns about inflation are connected to the small business outlook on the supply chain, with 75% saying these issues are likely to be a problem six months from now. And there is a lack of faith in policymakers, with 71% of small business owners not confident in the Federal Reserve's ability to control inflation.The CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted January 24-30, 2022 among a national sample of 2,227 self-identified small business owners.""The underlying problem with inflation is that there's no end in sight,"" said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at Momentive, which conducts the survey for CNBC. ""We've become accustomed to rising and falling Covid waves, and businesses have had the time to rewrite their playbooks to accommodate. But no one knows how quickly or to what degree inflation will continue to rise, so that unpredictability is inducing some unease,"" she said, with the lack of faith in the Fed adding to the uncertainty.""I don't think it is getting better. It has gotten worse,"" said Michelle Pusateri, owner of San Francisco-based Nana Joes Granola.Nana Joes Granola witnessed a boom in business during Covid as demand for packaged goods skyrocketed, but the business situation has flipped, with the hyper-growth from earlier in the pandemic now overwhelmed by supply chain and pricing issues and its profit margins being squeezed.Nana Joes Granola stocked up on ingredients and bought them at higher volumes to get lower pricing as demand outstripped supply and logistics issues worsened. The loading up on inventory is ""more of a stopgap right now,"" Pusateri said, but she expects it will probably become a long-term business issue. Her firm held $94,000 of inventory at the end of 2019, but by the end of last year, that had risen to $327,000.""I think more and more businesses will have to sit on more inventory,"" Pusateri said. In multiple ways, small business owners have lost leverage with suppliers. Large buyers are favored in transactions, and smaller buyers are no longer able to order in smaller batches (e.g. half-pallets) or rely on contract pricing.""Lots of ingredients are in high demand, meaning farmers and vendors and brokers can name their price. They can wait until the last highest bidder,"" said Pusateri, who is a member of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices community. Among that Main Street sample, 84% indicated in a recent survey that inflation has gotten worse for them since September, and only 13% see supply chain issues subsiding over the first half of 2022.Nana Joes Granola's main ingredient, oats, has seen a huge spike in price, and Pusateri does not expect any downward pricing pressure given the current level of supply and demand.It's not just an increase in input costs, but the magnitude of the increase which is walloping smaller companies. Eric Groves, co-founder and CEO at online small business platform Alignable, which has been tracking the impact of inflation, pointed to the percentage of businesses that indicate they are seeing the highest level of cost increases. Overall, 78% of small businesses say their costs are above pre-pandemic levels, but the largest block of small businesses (29%) say they are seeing price hikes of 25% or more for their business inputs.All of the headlines about inflation will make it easier for small business owners to increase costs and not have customers react as negatively as they might expect, but while over 50% of businesses are passing along the cost increases to customers, only 9% tell Alignable they can do this at a level where it is above breakeven for them.""Costs have gone up more than their ability to pass it on down, and that's what is critical to recovery,"" Groves said. ""That's where the feeling of stress is coming from. It's the squeezing of margins, not just revenue ... what's going in their pocket,"" he added.It is a fraught situation for small businesses trying to figure out how much they can afford to charge without risking a decline in customer numbers and loss of recurring revenue, with many small businesses still not all the way back from Covid's shock. Alignable's data finds roughly 35%-37% of businesses saying that 90% or more of their customers from the pre-Covid period have returned.Small business owners tend to be optimistic by nature, but Alignable's data shows them more pessimistic now about their own recovery timelines. Last June, small business owners expected revenue to be back at pre-Covid levels midway through 2022. Now that has been pushed back by a full year to mid-2023.Pusateri says inflation is beginning to eat into demand for her company's granola, which is priced at the premium end of the product category. ""People are starting to look at what they are spending on. For us, it's more of people starting to really look at pocketbooks,"" she said. NFIB's most recent quarterly survey found the percentage of small business owners having to increase prices rising to over 60%, the highest reading in the NFIB data since Q4 1974.""They are getting squeezed by supply chain disruptions and inflation and workforce shortages and already had to reinvent themselves a few times over in the past few years, and are running out of options,"" said Kevin Kuhlmann, who leads the NFIB's government relations team. ""They are continuing to adapt ... but you can only increase prices so much before you might see a loss,"" he said. Nana Joes Granola accessed a Covid economic injury disaster loan from the Small Business Administration to fund its higher level of inventory buying, but that financing program ended in 2021, and there is no indication the federal government will reinstate it. Pusateri said she is now being forced to contemplate business loans or taking on investors, a move she has not had to make previously.""There aren't many policy options for issues like inflation and the supply chain,"" Kuhlmann said. And even if inflation is tamed, that does not mean prices will go down. ""It's sort of a new normal,"" he said. ""You want to slow down price increases. It's frustrating business owners.""Small business does tend to be a lagging rather than a leading indicator for the economy, but the growing worries on Main Street are ""a worrisome indication that inflation will be more persistent,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.""Their pricing decisions tend to lag their bigger competitors, so if small businesses are raising prices more aggressively it could signal inflation becoming more endemic,"" Zandi said. And since small businesses do not tend to think of themselves as having pricing power over the long-term, if they are ""becoming more emboldened"" it is an indication that inflationary pressures are broader-based, he added. The CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Confidence Index score continues to hover around all-time lows, holding at 44 out of 100, which was unchanged from Q4 2021 and nearly identical to the all-time low score of 43 from a year ago. Overall, the business outlook is mixed, with 46% of Main Street businesses saying they expect revenue to increase in the next 12 months, according to the CNBC|SurveyMonkey data.Politics is a factor, with only 33% of business owners saying conditions are ""good,"" equal to the 33% of business owners who say they support President Biden.The percentage of Democrats who expressed support for Biden remains very high, at 83%, but did decline this quarter by six percentage points. Just under half (49%) of Democratic small business owners described conditions as good. A majority of Democrats expect inflation to still be a problem six months from now (67%) but that is considerably less than the 92% of Republicans who see inflation sticking around. And Democrats are much more likely to believe the Fed can control inflation, at 61%, versus 11% of Republicans surveyed. Certain sectors within the small business community that are more exposed to the global supply chain are facing greater pressures, and there are positive indicators across the business landscape. As a whole, companies are doing a good job of passing through costs to customers with corporate profit margins as wide as they've ever been back to World War II, but the benefits of pricing power are accruing more to the largest corporations.Small businesses do not typically have high cash reserve levels — according to Alignable it is on average 34 days of cash on hand — leading to a situation in which any kind of financial hit is very difficult to recover from. ""So as they are trying to build back to recovery from Covid, every little bit of extra margin they can eke out is critical, and with cost increases and the inability to pass along, we will see more and more businesses struggling with that,"" Groves said.A key measure of business health, business-to-business payment transactions, isn't showing any signs of stress, with even companies of 500 employees or less paying bills on time. ""At least so far, they are managing,"" Zandi said.Small businesses sentiment, similar to consumer sentiment, tends to be reactive and based on the most recent information or anecdote rather than longer-term forecasting, which means that current gas and fuel prices, which can be major inputs for small businesses, can lead to a sharper shift in sentiment in the short-term. On Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released an inflation survey that showed the first decline among Americans' inflation expectations in over a year, though still near a record level. But Zandi said if nothing else, the latest data from Main Street is ""proof positive we have a problem.""Pusateri described herself as ""a lot less confident now"" after having made it through Covid, and even having seen hyper-growth during the earlier part of the pandemic. ""I thought getting through 2020, 'oh my god, we did it.' We were still profitable. And then, all of a sudden, I couldn't find ingredients.""Nana Joes Granola went from 135% profit growth during the packaged foods boom to currently operating at less than breakeven in a pricing environment hitting it from all sides. In addition to the supply issues, wage inflation and lack of leverage as a buyer, freight charges across the country have risen and the company has had to change its free shipping policy for its direct consumer business. ""We're getting steamrolled over. Everywhere I look getting price increases,"" Pusateri said. The financial market and economists including Zandi expect inflation will moderate later in 2022, but if it doesn't happen soon, he said, ""the small business owners will be right.""""I don't think inflation is going away any time soon,"" Pusateri said. ""We will be stuck in this."" To learn more and to sign up for CNBC's Small Business Playbook event, click here."

2022-02-15,"The Federal Reserve is set to hike interest rates this year for the first time since 2018 to address the worst inflation in 40 years spurred by the coronavirus pandemic.Consumers already hit with higher prices might be wondering how it will help cool off rising costs.In January, the consumer price index surged 7.5% on the year, more than economists expected and the fastest gain since February 1982. It also marked the fourth month in a row of record price increases.More from Invest in You:If you are quitting a job, here are some options for health insuranceHere are the top jobs in the U.S. — and how to land themThis company just decided to give employees a 4-day week permanently""This is something really hard for the typical consumer to understand, seeing these fast price raises that are so unfamiliar to large parts of our population who haven't seen inflation rates like this before,"" said Tara Sinclair, a senior fellow at the Indeed Hiring Lab. ""And then trying to figure out the Fed's complicated role in all of this is very confusing.""Here's what you need to know.The Fed's mandateThe Federal Reserve has a few main goals it focuses on in the economy: to promote maximum employment, keep prices stable and have moderate long-term interest rates.Generally, the central bank aims to keep inflation around 2% annually, a benchmark that it lagged before the pandemic but now must address. The Fed's main tool it can use to battle inflation is interest rates. It does so by setting the short-term borrowing rate for commercial banks, and then those banks pass it along to consumers and businesses, said Yiming Ma, an assistant finance professor at Columbia University Business School.That rate influences everything from interest on credit cards to mortgages and car loans, making borrowing more expensive. On the flip side, it also boosts rates on high-yield savings accounts.Higher rates and the economyBut how do higher interest rates reel in inflation? By slowing down the economy.""The Fed uses interest rates as either a gas pedal or a brake on the economy when needed,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. ""With inflation running high, they can raise interest rates and use that to pump the brakes on the economy in an effort to get inflation under control.""   Basically, the Fed aims to make borrowing more expensive so that consumers and businesses hold off on making any investments, thereby cooling off demand and bringing prices back in check.There could also be a secondary effect of alleviating supply chain issues, one of the main reasons that prices are spiking right now, said McBride. Still, the Fed can't directly influence or solve supply chain problems, he said.""As long as the supply chain is an issue, we're likely to be contending with outside wage gains,"" which drive inflation, he said.What could go wrongThe main worry for economists is that the Fed raises interest rates too quickly and dampens demand too much, slowing down the economic recovery.This could lead to a higher unemployment rate if businesses stop hiring or even lay off workers to stay afloat. If the Fed really overshoots rate hikes, it could even push the economy back into a recession, halting and reversing the progress it has made so far. Treating inflation in the economy is like treating cancer with chemotherapy, said Sinclair.""You have to kill parts of the economy to slow things down,"" she said. ""It's not a pleasant treatment.""Of course, it will take some time for any action the Fed makes to impact the economy and curb inflation. That's why the Federal Open Market Committee carefully watches economic data to decide how much and how frequently to raise rates.Things could get worse before improvingThe Fed has signaled that it will likely raise interest rates in March. How much that first hike will be, and what will follow it, is still unclear.Markets are pricing in a 50 basis point, or 0.5%, rate increase in March, but have not reached any consensus on further rises.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Monday said he thinks the Fed should push up interest rates quickly.""I do think we need to front-load more of our planned removal of accommodation than we would have previously,"" Bullard told CNBC's Steve Liesman during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""We've been surprised to the upside on inflation. This is a lot of inflation."" Last week, he said in an interview with Bloomberg News that he thinks the Fed should raise rates by as much as 1 full percentage point by July. Other regional bank leaders have expressed the desire to increase rates beginning in March, but none are as hawkish as Bullard.When the Fed eventually does raise interest rates, it's also likely that people will see the negative aspects of those increases before any improvement on inflation, said Sinclair.Basically, that means consumers may have to pay more to borrow money and still see inflated prices at the gas pump and grocery store at first. This is particularly harmful for low-income workers, who have seen wages go up recently but not keep pace with inflation.Of course, the goal is for the Fed to raise rates gradually so that the economy slows just enough to bring down prices without boosting unemployment too much.""They have to carefully walk that tightrope,"" said Sinclair.SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

2022-02-15,"For years, Turkey and the UAE have been on opposing sides of regional conflicts due to deeply conflicting ideologies. Erdogan and the UAE's de-facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan on Monday signed 12 agreements across the defense, commercial and cultural sectors, along with significant investment pledges from the UAE.Just over a year prior, Dubai-Istanbul flights were suspended for months at a time and Turkish state news websites were inaccessible from the UAE without a VPN.  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in the United Arab Emirates to a warm welcome this week, praising renewed ties between the two regional powers after years of proxy competition, unofficial boycotts and acrimonious accusations. Erdogan and the UAE's de-facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, formerly adversaries, signed some 13 agreements in defense, trade, technology, agriculture and other sectors, along with significant investment pledges from the UAE. Dubai's iconic Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, was lit up with the colors of the Turkish flag and the words ""Hos Geldiniz,"" Turkish for ""welcome.""Just over a year prior, Dubai-Istanbul flights were suspended for months at a time and Turkish state news websites were inaccessible from the UAE without a VPN. ""During this visit, we aim to develop the momentum we have harnessed with the United Arab Emirates and to take all necessary steps for relations to revert to the level they merit,"" Erdogan told local media on Monday, before a visit to Dubai Expo on Tuesday. ""Dialogue and cooperation between Turkey and the United Arab Emirates carries great significance for peace and stability in our entire region.""Former UAE foreign minister and presidential advisor Anwar Gargash tweeted, ""President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to the UAE … opens a new positive page in the bilateral relations between the two countries."" Less than two years prior, in a 2020 interview, Gargash was calling for Europe to join forces against what he said was Erdogan's attempt ""to revive the Ottoman Empire."" The decision to make up is a big deal. For years, Turkey and the UAE have been on opposing sides of regional conflicts due to deeply conflicting ideologies. In the years since the Arab Spring, Erdogan and his pro-Muslim Brotherhood AK Party supported political Islam movements in numerous countries, something that's seen as a threat to Gulf monarchies like the UAE.  In their competition for regional influence, Ankara and Abu Dhabi backed opposite sides of the bloody Libyan civil war, which has now turned into a stalemate. Turkey vociferously opposed the blockade that the UAE and other Gulf states imposed on Qatar from 2017 to 2021, and Erdogan had previously accused the UAE of bankrolling Turkey's 2016 attempted military coup.   A number of key factors have led to the recent change.""The biggest single factor is the collapse of the Muslim Brotherhood project in the Arab world, which was the main basis for Turkish-UAE tensions over the past decade,"" said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.  Indeed, the Muslim Brotherhood's political power, which only really remained in Tunisia, Libya, Gaza and parts of Yemen, has been dramatically depleted in the last year with a coup and open-ended constitutional suspension in Tunisia and political stalemate in Libya. Turkey was viewed in the UAE ""as a leader, in cooperation with Qatar, of a potential network of Sunni Islamists throughout the region that could rival or even outdo Iran's network of Shiite armed gangs in neighboring Arab countries,"" Ibish said. ""But that didn't emerge. Instead, the Brotherhood has pretty much collapsed as a viable political project, so Turkey appears much less threatening than before.""  U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, which has signaled it's no longer giving carte blanche to its Gulf allies, is likely another factor. But more obvious are economic needs and an apparent pullback by both countries from regional conflicts in favor of diplomacy and business links. ""I think for both sides we're seeing the reemergence of pragmatism after years of confrontationalism and adventurism in the Trump era,"" said Ryan Bohl, a Middle East and Africa analyst at Rane Risk Intelligence. ""That's in part because there's a new [U.S.] presidential administration, but I think most of it is driven by their own shifting imperatives caused by the pandemic.""  Turkey's economy is in crisis, with inflation at a whopping 48.7% and its national currency, the lira, having lost roughly 48% of its value in the last year. Meanwhile, the UAE has been pushing to further diversify its economy away from oil and revive itself from the economic blow of Covid-19. ""The UAE is looking to invest money. Turkey needs money invested. It's a natural fit,"" Ibish said. And the timing means the Emiratis are getting a bargain, thanks to the cheapness of the lira.  Abu Dhabi state investment vehicle ADQ in January pledged $10 billion in investments into Turkey, saying that now was a ""great time"" to buy with the dramatically weakened currency and that it was taking a ""long term view."" And during a visit by Mohammed bin Zayed to Ankara in November, the first in many years, ADQ and Turkish investment bodies and companies signed memorandums of understanding worth billions of dollars in sectors including energy, technology and logistics. ""For the UAE, Turkey becomes a major new conduit to new markets in Asia, and especially Africa,"" Ibish said. ""Turkey also provides an entrée into certain commercial fields and Turkish real estate is potentially a bonanza, if all goes well."" Turkey is also seeking to mend ties with Israel, officially a friend of the UAE since the announcement of the Abraham Accords in August of 2020. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled for an official visit to Turkey in March, despite the fact that Turkey in 2020 threatened to cut ties with the UAE over its normalization deal with Israel.The rapprochement comes amid heightened tensions in the region as Iran's nuclear development progresses, and in the wake of a series of drone and missile attacks on the UAE mostly claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran.  ""The new U.S. administration and western countries' policy vis-à-vis Iran, and Turkey's new diplomatic approach to Israel … are some of the reasons behind this new page"" in relations, one former Turkish diplomat with experience in the Gulf told CNBC, speaking anonymously due to professional constraints.""For the Turkish side, the increase of economic and commercial relations will be very important. On the UAE side, [having] Turkey as a trusted ally vis-à-vis Iran will be the benefit,"" the diplomat said.Still, the coalescence of mutual interests doesn't mean the ideological differences between the two countries have been resolved. ""At the moment what it looks like is both sides are licking their wounds and making nice because the costs of confrontationalism became increasingly too high for them,"" Rane's Bohl said. ""But that doesn't mean that they've come to any substantial agreements and so conflict and competition could return again one day.""In the meantime, it's time for all the countries that are ""overextended"" from regional sparring ""to take a break from confrontation,"" Ibish said, ""meaning diplomacy, politics and commerce as a means of securing their interests and projecting their influence."""
2022-02-15,"About 25% of Taco Bell's international footprint is stores that have opened in the last two years.The chain has been accelerating its international presence, narrowing its focus on key markets and driving digital sales.Taco Bell said it's on track to open 1,000 international restaurants ""within the very near future."" Taco Bell is accelerating its growth outside the U.S., opening 25% of its international restaurants in just the last two years.The Yum Brands chain announced Tuesday that it opened its 100th restaurant in Spain. The chain said it's on track to build 1,000 international units, although it did not share a timeline to reach that goal. At the end of 2020, about 8% of Taco Bell's 7,427 restaurants were located outside the U.S.In its home market, Taco Bell has built a strong following of loyal fans, who even get married at its Las Vegas location. Fans include vegetarians, whose vocal disappointment in menu cuts helped bring back its potato options last year. Still, the chain's U.S. business took longer than Yum's other two large brands, KFC and Pizza Hut, to bounce back from the pandemic. The loss of late-night and morning demand hurt Taco Bell sales.While Yum reports systemwide sales growth by country for Pizza Hut and KFC, the company doesn't break out those results for Taco Bell. In the fourth quarter, Taco Bell reported same-store sales growth of 8% across all of its locations.""We are on track to 1,000 stores, and that is within our sights within the very near future,"" said Julie Felss Masino, Taco Bell's international president, in an interview.She added that Taco Bell CEO Mark King has set a goal for the chain to see $20 billion in annual revenue, and international growth is an important component to reaching that target.Felss Masino became head of Taco Bell's international business in January 2020, after two years running the chain's U.S. operations in the wake of Brian Niccol's departure to Chipotle Mexican Grill. Under her leadership, Taco Bell's international division has focused on several key markets: Spain, the United Kingdom, India, and Australia and New Zealand.Taco Bell's international strategy includes betting on digital orders. In the U.K., 60% of transactions come from online customers. The chain has been opening digital-only locations and restaurants with pick-up windows dedicated to delivery drivers.""That's what being an easy, accessible brand is all about, and that's a cornerstone of how we're growing internationally,"" Felss Masino said.Unlike its U.S. business, all of Taco Bell's international locations are run by franchisees. Some of those operators have been a part of Yum for decades, running KFC or Pizza Hut restaurants in their countries.""We've been working with our franchise partners to get to scale very quickly,"" Felss Masino said. ""Scale helps the consumers because the brand feels bigger, it's something they want to be a part of. Sometimes we can do more things in the market with marketing.""Felss Masino also said Yum's scale and expertise has helped Taco Bell as it accelerates its international growth. Yum is the largest restaurant company in the world by number of locations. In 2021, Yum opened more than 4,100 locations worldwide — that's higher than the number of Tim Hortons locations in Canada.Shares of Yum have risen 14% over the last 12 months, giving the company a market value of $35.5 billion."

The Federal Reserve's counterparts in Asian emerging markets are ""in no rush"" to chase the U.S. central bank despite its ""sharp turn towards a hawkish stance,"" Bank of America economists said.""With little concerns of falling behind the curve, most monetary authorities in EM Asia will likely stick to their own pace and pay more attention to domestic demand recovery,"" the economists wrote in a note published last week.Global markets have seen a wave of volatility as investors reposition in anticipation of multiple rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this year. That scenario has in the past hurt Asia's emerging economies as it drives the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields higher, potentially spurring capital flight from the region.But the Bank of America economists said there are three reasons central banks in emerging Asia can ""cool their feet for longer"":Modest consumer inflation: ""Annual CPI inflation is expected to stay broadly in line with the policy targets, which warrant regional central banks to adjust monetary policies at their own pace, in our view.""Subdued domestic demand growth: ""Our current forecasts suggest that the average EM Asia GDP growth during 2020-22 will remain below the pre-COVID trend.

That stands in ""sharp contrast"" to peers in South Korea and Singapore, he said, where central banks have tightened monetary policy to combat inflation."
2022-02-16,"More and more international investment analysts say it's time to buy mainland Chinese stocks, ahead of expected government support for growth.Bernstein and Goldman Sachs, in particular, have released thick reports on the investability of Chinese shares.However, not all investment analysts are as optimistic. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Asset Management are neutral on mainland China. BEIJING — More and more international investment analysts say it's time to buy mainland Chinese stocks, ahead of expected government support for growth.On top of the pandemic's drag on the economy, heightened regulatory uncertainty since last summer has generally kept foreign investors cautious on Chinese stocks.related investing newsThese US stocks have the most to lose — and gain — from ChinaYun Li2 days agoBut that's starting to change for some investment firms in the last several months.In its global stock strategy report for 2022, Credit Suisse upgraded China to ""overweight,"" reversing a downgrade of the stocks about 12 months ago.""Monetary policy is being eased [in China] while elsewhere it is being tightened,"" its global strategist Andrew Garthwaite and his team wrote in the late January report. ""Economic momentum is turning up.""One of the early positive turns on mainland Chinese stocks came from BlackRock Investment Institute in late September. As 2022 got underway, other firms also made similar calls, while others remain neutral.On the political front, Credit Suisse expects regulatory uncertainty to subside after a national parliamentary meeting in March, and remain muted — at least until after the ruling Chinese Communist Party's 20th National Congress in the fourth quarter. Chinese President Xi Jinping is widely expected to take on an unprecedented third term at the meeting, which occurs every five years to select top government leaders.During a December economic planning meeting for 2022, Chinese officials emphasized the need for stability.Financial factors, such as how much the stocks have fallen compared to their potential ability to deliver earnings, also contribute to analysts' positive turn on Chinese stocks. In January, Bernstein released a 172-page report titled ""Chinese Equities: 'Uninvestable' No More.""""We believe there is a case to add back China exposure to global portfolios due to six key reasons,"" analysts at the investment research firm said.They pointed to expectations for growth in new financing, easier monetary policy and more attractive stock valuations relative to the rest of the world. Other factors included a rare opportunity to pick stocks, growing foreign inflows and increased earnings. The Shanghai composite has climbed 2% since the Lunar New Year holiday, which was from Jan. 31 to Feb. 6 this year. Those gains follow a drop of 7.65% in January, the worst month for the index since October 2018, according to Wind Information data. ""Investors are too bearish about China stocks,"" HSBC analysts wrote in a Feb. 7 report that affirmed its call in October to upgrade Chinese stocks to overweight.""Yes, China is struggling with growth and a stronger USD is not good news for China's stock markets,"" the analysts said. ""But that's now well-known and is priced in. Even good, blue chip stocks are now trading at attractive valuations.""The bank's analysts forecast 9.2% gains this year for the Shanghai composite, and 15.6% for the Shenzhen component index. Goldman Sachs forecasts 16% in gains for the MSCI China index this year as valuations remain below the Wall Street bank's target of a 14.5 price-to-earnings ratio, its chief China Equity Strategist Kinger Lau said in a Jan. 23 report.On Sunday, Lau and his team released an 89-page report about ""why China A shares have become more investable for global investors."" Their reasoning for investment in the world's second largest stock market is based largely on greater accessibility for foreign investors and under-allocation to the share class so far.

What to know about the new investing landscape A-shares are mainland Chinese companies listed in China, either on the Shanghai Stock Exchange or the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.Goldman Sachs had turned overweight on mainland shares in February 2020, during the height of the coronavirus pandemic in the country. In late October, UBS announced it was upgrading Chinese stocks to ""overweight,"" up two notches from an ""underweight"" call in the summer of 2020.In another sign of the firm's optimism, the emerging markets strategy team said in January its highest-conviction stock ideas include many Chinese internet names like Alibaba that have been the target of Beijing's new regulation on alleged monopolistic practices and data security. However, not all international investment firms are as optimistic.Morgan Stanley's Asia emerging markets stock strategy team is neutral on mainland China, as are Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Asset Management.During past years of stimulus, China hasn't always seen a bull market, Winnie Wu, China equity strategist, BofA Securities, said in a phone interview Monday. While there are investment opportunities within certain sectors, she expects corporate earnings growth across China to decelerate.Wu pointed out that in 2016, despite expectations of stimulus, stocks only began to climb after the second quarter. The Shanghai composite closed 12.3% lower that year. A sell-off in mainland shares so far this year reflects how investors have generally remained cautious on Chinese stocks.Even in upgrades, firms like BlackRock have used conservative language like turning ""modestly positive"" and cautioned that: ""Given the small benchmark weights and typical client allocation to Chinese assets, allocation would have to increase by multiples before they represent a bullish bet on China, and even more for government bonds."" A sharp plunge in Chinese property prices, widespread lockdowns due to the pandemic and regulatory uncertainty pose risks to Credit Suisse's outlook, Garthwaite said.China's pursuit of ""common prosperity"" — moderate wealth for all, rather than just a few — emerged over the summer as the theme for Beijing's regulatory changes.While the policy remains ""the big unknown,"" Garthwaite noted official remarks — such as Xi's speech at the World Economic Forum in January — indicate an easier stance going forward.""The common prosperity we desire is not egalitarianism ... we will first make the pie bigger and then divide it properly through reasonable institutional arrangements,"" Xi said at that time. ""All types of capital are welcome to operate in China.""— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report."

That's despite claims by the Russian government a day earlier, that the Kremlin was starting a partial drawdown of its troops along the Ukrainian border, and returning them to their base. The military tensions have sparked concerns that Russia may be preparing to invade the country, and set off fears of a repeat of the Kremlin's illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea in 2014. Moscow has repeatedly denied those allegations.Gas as well as oil prices have shot up on the back of those tensions, but were trading lower on Thursday. The trade minister told CNBC that his country is already taking steps to manage its supply chain risk.Some of South Korea's key exports include autos, chips, and other electronics.Yeo said the government is trying to work out which critical raw materials could be vulnerable.""We are trying to identify all these critical raw materials which could disrupt our supply chain and then for example, if we depend on one or two countries [for] too much of this critical raw material, that could be also vulnerable,"" he said. South Korea is also trying to develop an ""early warning system"" which flags risks to some of these key materials. ""If there's some sort of signs or red flags in the supply chain, [we could] in advance respond to that potential risk right away,"" he added.If necessary, he said, a stockpiling system or some sort of swap system could be developed with other countries, Yeo said.

2022-02-18,"Chinese President Xi Jinping told top leaders in early December to speed up work on new laws for the tech sector, according to a speech published Wednesday by the Chinese Communist Party's bimonthly journal.It's a sign that regulation is not going away, even as the speech covers little new ground and economists expect the worst of Beijing's crackdown is over.Chen Long, partner at Beijing-based consulting firm Plenum, emphasized it's important not to read too much into Xi's speech. ""This speech is not something new but a summary of what they have done,"" he said. BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping told top leaders to speed up work on new laws for the technology sector during a speech in early December, according to the Chinese Communist Party's bimonthly journal published Wednesday.It's a sign that regulation is not going away yet, even though the speech covers little new ground and economists expect the worst of Beijing's crackdown is over.China must ""accelerate the pace of legislation in the fields of digital economy, internet finance, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, etc.,"" Xi said, according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text.He also called for more laws to ensure national security, and urged increased use of law for ""international struggles"" — including countering foreign sanctions.But most of Xi's speech, delivered on Dec. 6 to China's Central Politburo of top leaders, focused on broad theoretical points such as not blindly following Western systems. In the last year, a succession of new rules aimed at tackling alleged monopolistic practices by tech companies, data security and other issues have shocked global investors. The regulations address long-standing problems, but their abruptness has disrupted businesses and prompted mass layoffs.""We anticipate there will be continuing developments in regulations particularly as related to tech,"" said Mattie Bekink, China director at the Economist Corporate Network. She pointed out that Beijing has released plans for building a ""Chinese socialist rule of law"" by 2035. ""I do think the use of regulation as a tool to shape the economy and society that China wants is not over,"" Bekink said.She noted how law in the West tends to focus on the relationship between individuals and the state, while in China, the focus has been on commercial law — relationships between private sectors and the state. Xi's speech — given over two months ago but released publicly this week — is just one of the many official statements offered to the public in a country where information is tightly controlled.Reading between the lines of similar official commentary, economists concluded last week that the worst of China's regulatory crackdown is over as Beijing focuses more on growth. But they said that doesn't mean a reversal or an end to new rules.""Xi puts a lot of emphasis on the use of law,"" said Chen Long, partner at Beijing-based consulting firm Plenum. ""The Chinese government uses a lot of regulations to govern.

""This speech is not something new,"" he said, ""but a summary of what they have done.""Even on the point of China's use of law to counter foreign sanctions, Beijing had passed such legislation in June. If the Chinese government deems individuals or entities as involved in taking discriminatory action against Chinese citizens or entities, the law allows Beijing to freeze assets or deny entry, among other measures. ""China wants to use law to protect its interests in relation to other nations, including both adding domestic authority and having a voice in shaping international law norms to better serve its interests — which I don't think is unusual for a nation to do,"" said Jeremy Daum, senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center. China's crackdown on tech comes as the industry has grown rapidly beyond the scope of existing regulations. It's a balance governments worldwide are trying to strike as they consider how to regulate cryptocurrencies, data and other new technologies.In some areas such as algorithms, Beijing is acting more quickly than other governments and could even set a global precedent, analysts have said. Meanwhile on the political front, Chinese authorities have promoted their efforts to eliminate poverty and grow the middle class — a move away from prioritizing economic growth at all costs.Much of the shift came just after the ruling Chinese Communist Party celebrated its 100th anniversary on July 1. This coming fall, the party is expected to give Xi an unprecedented third term as president."

While U.S. authorities have said banking restrictions would be part of a package of possible sanctions, the administration's plan to cut correspondent banking ties — which underpin global money flows — has not previously been reported.  President Joe Biden's administration has prepared an initial package of sanctions against Russia that includes barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, three people familiar with the matter said.The measures, which would only be implemented if Russia invades Ukraine, aim to hurt the Russian economy by cutting the ""correspondent"" banking relationships between targeted Russian banks and U.S. banks that enable international payments.While U.S. authorities have said banking restrictions would be part of a package of possible sanctions, the administration's plan to cut correspondent banking ties — which underpin global money flows — has not previously been reported.The United States will also wield its most powerful sanctioning tool against certain Russian individuals and companies by placing them on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, effectively kicking them out of the U.S. banking system, banning their trade with Americans and freezing their U.S. assets, the same sources said.The White House and Treasury Department declined to comment.The sources said the package could change up to the last minute and it was unclear who the targets would be. However, they believe top Russian financial institutions including VTB Bank, Sberbank, VEB, and Gazprombank are possible targets.Experts consulted by Reuters said that while the correspondent banking tool lacks the punch of an SDN designation, which freezes a bank's assets, they could still deal a meaningful blow to the target banks by making it difficult to transact in U.S. dollars, the global reserve currency. Much of global trade is transacted in dollars.It is unclear whether Russian banks would be added to the SDN list, but both types of sanctions could hit Russia hard.""Since a significant number of global trade transactions are in U.S. dollars this is a sanction with bite, but without the more complicated and deadly sanction of being placed on the SDN list and having all assets in the U.S. or in the hands of U.S. persons frozen,"" said Washington lawyer Kay Georgi, who specializes in international trade.Sources noted that the administration could exempt certain transactions from the restrictions if deemed necessary. The Biden administration has been threatening tough banking sanctions against Russia for weeks in a bid to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. Moscow has amassed upwards of 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, but Putin has denied plans to launch an attack.Peter Harrell, who sits on the National Security Council, said last month that ""heavy hitting financial sanctions"" were part of a strategy to hurt Russia's economy but spare its citizens. ""The goal of the financial sanctions is really to have short term upfront costs on Russia, to trigger capital flight, to trigger inflation, to make the Russian central bank provide bailouts to its banks,"" he said in a speech late last month.The tough warnings have put some U.S. financial firms on edge. Members of the financial services and payment industries have been in touch in recent days with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers sanctions, sources said.Tensions grew over the weekend as Russia extended military drills in Belarus, heightening fears among Western powers of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.Biden and Putin on Sunday agreed in principle to a summit, France said, offering hope conflict could be avoided.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the United States and Britain would cut off Russian companies' access to U.S. dollars and British pounds if the Kremlin orders an invasion.The Biden administration has been similarly aggressive in its rhetoric.

2022-02-22,"China will cut taxes and fees on a greater scale this year, while focusing on supporting the nation's tech development, Finance Minister Liu Kun said Tuesday.Escalating tensions with the U.S. have cut China off from suppliers of key technologies, and prompted Beijing to introduce policies for supporting homegrown technology.During Tuesday's press conference, finance ministry officials also emphasized more support for small businesses, timely pension payments to retirees and greater transfer of payments from the central government to local governments. BEIJING — China will cut taxes and fees on a greater scale this year, while focusing on supporting the nation's tech development, Finance Minister Liu Kun said Tuesday.China's economic growth slowed after a rebound from the initial shock of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. Analysts expect more fiscal and monetary policy support this year.The first fiscal policy task is to cut taxes and fees by a greater scale than last year, Liu told reporters at a press conference, without specifying a figure. Those reductions totaled 1.1 trillion yuan ($173.5 billion) in 2021.The second point Liu brought up was support for technological ""self-reliance"" and stable manufacturing supply chains. National expenditures on science and technology rose by 7.2% in 2021 to 970 billion yuan, he said, noting the funds supported development of chips and new energy vehicles.Escalating tensions with the U.S. have cut China off from suppliers of key technologies, and prompted Beijing to introduce policies to support homegrown tech. Last year, the central government announced it planned to increase spending on research and development by more than 7% a year between 2021 and 2025.""The Ministry of Finance sticks to the priority of ensuring the national development strategy of scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement,"" vice minister Yu Weiping told reporters at the same meeting, in response to a question about the ministry's work on tech. That's according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese. Yu said the central government increased spending on basic research last year by 15.3% to an unspecified amount, primarily to support work at state-run institutions.He claimed that during the first three quarters of 2021, businesses in China received 1.3 trillion yuan in additional deductions for research and development expenses, and more than 330 billion yuan in tax cuts.During Tuesday's press conference, the finance ministry officials also emphasized more support for small businesses, timely pension payments to retirees and greater transfer of payments from the central government to local governments. There was no mention of real estate, a giant industry that has contributed significantly to local government revenues.China's property market has slumped in the last several months amid Beijing's crackdown on developers' high reliance on debt for growth.

2022-02-22,"Consumers reported losing more than $5.8 billion to fraud in 2021, a 70% increase over the prior year, the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday.Almost 2.8 million people filed a fraud complaint, an annual record.Imposter scams were most prevalent, but investment scams cost the typical victim the most money. American consumers reported losing more than $5.8 billion to fraud last year, up from $3.4 billion in 2020 (an increase of more than 70%), the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday.Almost 2.8 million consumers filed a fraud report to the agency in 2021 — the highest number on record dating back to 2001, according to the FTC. About 25% of those scams led to a financial loss, with the typical person losing $500.The true toll is almost certainly higher since some incidents likely weren't reported to the agency.More from Personal Finance:Parents face a surprise tax bill if kids are trading stocksGoing abroad? What it's like to self-test for your flight homeHow to keep emotions out of your investment decisionsThose figures also don't include reports of identity theft and other categories. More than 1.4 million Americans also reported being a victim of identity theft in 2021; another 1.5 million filed complaints related to ""other"" categories (including credit reporting companies failing to investigate disputed information, or debt collectors falsely representing the amount or status of debt). Both sums are annual records, according to the FTC.Fraud has ballooned during the Covid-19 pandemic, as con artists have preyed on consumer fear and confusion. They peddled fake health products (such as hand sanitizer and masks) and used stolen data to file for unemployment and other benefits in victims' names, for example.Imposter scams were the most prevalent form of fraud in 2021, accounting for more than a third of reports, the FTC said. The typical victim lost $1,000. In such scams, criminals pretend to be someone else to steal money or sensitive personal information. They may include romance scams, as well as people falsely claiming to be a government official, a relative in distress, a well-known business or a technical support expert, for example, according to the FTC.However, other forms of fraud were costlier on a per-person basis — investment fraud cost $3,000 per victim in 2021, for example, the largest such sum. Business and job-opportunity scams cost the typical victim almost $2,000.Younger Americans tended to be fraud targets most frequently, but those over age 70 reported losing more money. The typical person over age 80 lost $1,500, triple that of those in their 20s.   "

All U.K. individuals and entities will also be barred from having dealings with them, he added.Johnson said the move to sanction Russia had arisen despite himself and several other world leaders giving Putin ""every opportunity"" to pursue his aims via diplomacy.""We will not give up,"" Johnson said. ""We will continue to seek a diplomatic solution until the last possible moment but we have to face the possibility that none of our messages have been heeded and that Putin is implacably determined to go further in subjugating and tormenting Ukraine."" He added, ""This the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Union if the situation escalates still further.""His comments come as EU lawmakers prepare to impose sanctions against Russian politicians, banks and to limit the ability of the Kremlin to access the bloc's capital, financial markets and services. A final decision on the EU's package of sanctions is expected later Tuesday.Meanwhile, Germany on Tuesday halted the certification of the highly contentious Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to bring natural gas from Russia directly to Europe. Johnson said Putin had ""flagrantly violated"" international law by formally recognizing Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states. The Russian president on Monday ordered troops to the breakaway areas to ""perform peacekeeping functions.""The directive drew condemnation from around the world, with policymakers admonishing a ""blatant"" and ""unacceptable"" violation of international law.The developing situation has ratcheted up fears of a major conflict in Europe following months of simmering tensions over Russia's military deployment on the borders of Ukraine.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a televised address Tuesday that the country remains ""dedicated to diplomatic means of solving this issue.""""This is our choice. We are on our land. We're not afraid of anyone and everyone,"" he said, according to a transcript by NBC News. The U.K. prime minister said it was ""absolutely vital"" to keep further sanctions in reserve in view of the escalating crisis.""We want to stop Russian companies from being able to raise funds in sterling or indeed in dollars. ... We want them to stop raising funds on U.K. markets and we want to strip away the veil that conceals the ownership of property in this country and indeed throughout the West,"" Johnson said.""The measures that we have prepared are much, much tougher still and we will have absolutely no hesitation in implementing them.""

Caroline Lucas, a member of Parliament for the U.K.'s Green Party, said via Twitter.""Sanctioning 5 banks and 3 oligarchs suggests the Government cares more about protecting Tory party donations and London's laundromat than it does about imposing meaningful sanctions against Moscow,"" she said.The term ""London laundromat"" refers to a widely used accusation that the U.K. has become a haven for illicit finance from Russia in recent years.Meanwhile, Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons Defense Committee, said that while he welcomed the actions taken by the government, ""sanctions alone will not be enough.""He added, ""Indeed, untargeted sanctions may play into Putin's plan to pivot Russia ever closer to China.""Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the government should seize the assets of all Russian oligarchs in the U.K., adding that international cultural events — such as the final of UEFA's Champions League soccer tournament — must be prevented from taking place in Russia.In response, Johnson said more action was to come from his government and it was ""inconceivable"" that major international sporting events could now take place in Russia.Timothy Ash, emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, described the U.K.'s response as ""embarrassing.""""I mean why bother?""

2022-02-23,"As fears of an all-out invasion of Ukraine by Russia heighten, spikes in energy prices and knock-on economic effects could spell trouble for central banks.A number of major central banks have already begun the process of tightening monetary policy in an attempt to combat record-high inflation, but spikes in oil and natural gas prices could exacerbate the issue even further.""If oil and gas prices continue to drive higher, central banks may be forced to accelerate their pace of tightening,"" one strategist said.  LONDON — As troops enter eastern Ukraine and fears of an all-out invasion of the country by Russia heighten, the associated spikes in energy prices and knock-on economic effects could spell trouble for central banks.Global markets were volatile on Tuesday and oil prices soared to seven-year highs after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Moscow would recognize the independence of two breakaway areas of eastern Ukraine and send troops into the region.International economic sanctions started rolling in as a result. The U.K. initially slapped targeted sanctions on five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals, while Germany halted the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, designed to transport natural gas from Russia directly to Europe. European foreign affairs ministers met in Brussels on Tuesday to determine the EU's response.The geopolitical uncertainty comes at a difficult time for the world's central banks. A number have already begun the process of tightening monetary policy in an attempt to combat record-high inflation, but spikes in oil and natural gas prices will likely exacerbate the issue even further. The Bank of England fired the starting gun on raising interest rates last tear, and has implemented two hikes at its last two meetings, while the market is pricing in an imminent lift-off and aggressive hiking cycle from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The European Central Bank has lagged its peers in terms of a hawkish pivot so far, but is expected to begin tightening late in 2022, with euro zone inflation also running at a record high.Euro zone money markets were pricing in a 10 basis point hike by June 2022 following the central bank's Feb. 3 meeting, with 50 basis points' worth of hikes expected by the end of the year. However, money markets on Tuesday showed investors' expectations for hikes had diminished slightly. They indicated around a 95% chance of a 10 basis point hike in July, with 40 basis points priced in by year-end.""If oil and gas prices continue to drive higher, central banks may be forced to accelerate their pace of tightening with the potential for a double rate hike at March's lift-off date from the Fed,"" Victoria Scholar, head of investment at British retail investment platform Interactive Investor, said in a note Tuesday. ECB policymakers themselves have begun do diverge in their reactions to Russia's latest escalation. Austrian central bank Governor Robert Holtzmann suggested the ECB could make its first post-pandemic rate hike this summer before the end of its bond-purchase program.Holtzmann also said a second rate hike could come before the end of the year, but the Austrian is seen as one of the more hawkish members of the ECB's rate-setting lineup.Fellow policymaker and Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB should keep its options open as it assesses the Russia-Ukraine crisis. This message was echoed on Wednesday by Lithuanian central bank Governor Gediminas Šimkus, who told CNBC that the ECB should maintain a ""data driven, forward looking"" approach to decision making in the face of the current scale of uncertainty. ""It should be reliable, it should be objective, it should fit our criteria, so let's wait for March when the decisions are to be taken and let's see what data we do have at that particular moment,"" Šimkus said.He added that in order to retain its credibility, the ECB must align with its forward guidance, which set out that its asset purchase program would end before interest rate hikes begin.""So I'm open to all and I'm flexible to all of these scenarios of the inflation dynamics but with that high uncertainty, we should wait and see what is happening exactly at the moment when decisions are taken, and then we should talk about this at that moment,"" Šimkus said. Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC that the conflict in Ukraine could exert even more pressure on central banks, heightening the likelihood of a policy mistake.""We knew, coming into 2022, that they [central bankers] faced a very difficult balance: tighten too quickly, slow the economy too far; tighten too slowly and risk losing control of medium-term inflation expectations,"" Gimber said Tuesday.An invasion of Ukraine by Russia could ultimately deepen this confusion, he said, with higher energy prices continuing to push the expected inflation peak further out.""Ultimately, I think the central banks are working with a relatively blunt toolkit here. Just as they couldn't solve semiconductor shortages last year, that were putting significant upward pressure on goods prices, nor can they solve higher energy prices via rate hikes this year,"" Gimber said. JPMorgan expects central banks to prioritize growth over an aggressive attempt to drag inflation back toward targets. Gimber noted that history suggests relatively short-lived market sell-offs during geopolitical events, but recommended in the meantime that investors return to benchmark weighting while assessing the implications of potential conflict on oil prices and consumers. While higher energy prices are an inflationary force, the risk of conflict also brings to the fore concerns about recessionary pressures; it's creating an ""increasingly complex conundrum"" for central banks, according to Interactive Investor's Victoria Scholar.Given this dichotomy, Matteo Cominetta, senior economist at Barings Investment Institute, warned that investors should position for even higher uncertainty and prepare for the possibility of policy mistakes.With regards to Europe in particular, he said: ""With inflation already testing ECB policymakers' nerves and credibility, it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. The ECB could rush to the exit in its meeting next month, announcing a quick wrap up of its QE programs and signal a rate hike already in the summer.""""This could prove a mistake, as the invasion would likely hurt growth as well. Soaring energy prices would hit household and business purchasing power, confidence and willingness to spend and invest. Imports costs would rise more than export value, hurting the trade balance. The post-omicron recovery could well be weakened,"" he added. Cominetta also highlighted that the cost of credit could be driven up in southern and eastern Europe, a trend already seen in the Baltic states, while eastern European central banks will also need to contend with a devaluation of their currencies.""A Russian invasion would send their currencies sharply down, exactly the opposite of what central banks wanted, in a bid to control inflation,"" he said.""Currency reserves will then have to be spent to prop up the currencies, stabilize inflation and maintain financial stability. Countries with low reserves, a negative current account and energy import dependency may find it hard to do so."""

2022-02-23,"Russia is also the world's top wheat exporter. Together with Ukraine, both account for roughly 29% of the global wheat export market.""China is also a big recipient of Ukrainian corn — in fact, Ukraine replaced the U.S. as China's top corn supplier in 2021,"" said Dawn Tiura, president at Sourcing Industry Group.Russia and Ukraine are also big suppliers of metals and other commodities, analysts said.While the European Union would be affected by the escalating crisis, Germany would be especially hit. Oil and gas prices are set to spike further as the Russia-Ukraine crisis escalates, but the impact on energy won't be the only ramification.From wheat to barley, and copper to nickel, analysts tell CNBC that supply chains are set to be disrupted as the crisis takes a turn for the worse.Ukraine is considered the ""breadbasket of Europe,"" and an invasion would result in the food supply chain getting ""hit hard,"" said Alan Holland, CEO and founder at sourcing technology company Keelvar. Russia and Ukraine are also big suppliers of metals and other commodities, analysts said.Tensions between Russia and Ukraine reached fever pitch in the past few days as President Vladimir Putin ordered the Kremlin's forces into two pro-Russian separatist regions in eastern Ukraine. It came after he said Russia would formally recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk.  U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday described Russia's actions as the beginning ""an invasion"" of Ukraine.Here's what's at risk if a military conflict takes place or crippling sanctions are imposed. Ukraine produces wheat, barley and rye that much of Europe relies on, analysts said. It's also a big producer of corn.""Even though harvesting season is still a few months away, a prolonged conflict would create bread shortages [and increase consumer prices] this fall,"" said Holland.In fact, it's not just the European Union that will be hit — many nations in the Middle East and Africa also rely on Ukranian wheat and corn, and disruptions to that supply could affect food security in those regions, said Dawn Tiura, president at Sourcing Industry Group.""China is also a big recipient of Ukrainian corn — in fact, Ukraine replaced the U.S. as China's top corn supplier in 2021,"" she said.  Wheat and corn prices were already soaring. Wheat futures traded in Chicago have jumped about 12% since the start of this year, while corn futures spiked 14.5% in the same period.Food inflation has been rising, and could worsen if an armed conflict erupts.""Rising food prices would only be exacerbated with additional price shocks, especially if core agricultural areas in Ukraine are seized by Russian loyalists,"" said Per Hong, senior partner at consulting firm Kearney. He pointed out that Russia is also the world's top wheat exporter. Together with Ukraine, both account for roughly 29% of the global wheat export market.Further, any disruptions to the natural gas supply will in turn affect the production of energy-intensive products such as fertilizers — and that's bound to hit agriculture further, said Holland. Fertilizers were already in short supply last year, leading to soaring prices.Russia was the largest supplier of natural gas and oil to the European Union last year. Ukraine has steadily increased its exports over the years, and is now a ""huge provider"" of raw materials, chemical products and even machinery like transportation equipment, according to Tiura.It's also a major supplier of minerals and other commodities, analysts said.""Ukraine's currency began declining in value since Russian troops started gathering at the border. This will increase the cost of their exports,"" Tiura added. Russia also controls about 10% of global copper reserves, and is a major producer of nickel and platinum, according to Hong.Nickel is a key raw material used in electric vehicle batteries, and copper — widely seen as an economic bellwether — is extensively used in electronics manufacturing and construction of homes.""The U.S. chip industry heavily relies on Ukrainian-sourced neon and Russia also exports a number of elements critical to the manufacturing of semiconductors, jet engines, automobiles and medicine,"" Hong said. While most of the European Union would be affected by the escalating crisis, Germany would be especially hard-hit.Germany derives most of its energy needs for manufacturing and electricity from the natural gas it gets from Russia, said Atul Vashistha, chairman and CEO of supply chain risk intelligence firm Supply Wisdom.""If tensions continue to rise and we see an increase in disruptions due to a potential war or sanctions, it will hold back manufacturing production in Germany. Factories would need to curtail production which would cascade to manufacturing in other countries,"" he told CNBC in an email.Top exports from Germany include autos and auto parts, other transport equipment, electronics, metals and plastics."

The unemployment rate has fallen from a crisis peak of 14.7% to 4%.On the broader economic side, the slight upward revision of GDP from the initial reading of 6.9% was in line with market estimates. That brought full-year growth to 5.7%, the fastest pace since 1984 that was driven by a strong inventory rebuild in the second half of the year.The change higher came due to increased contributions from fixed investment and state and local government spending. Downward revisions to consumer spending and exports offset some of the gains."

""Policymakers would be assessing the impact of the past three interest rate hikes since August last year,"" said Yoon Yeo-sam, an analyst at Meritz Securities.""They would need to check the Fed's policy stance in March and also consider some relief from slowing household debt, home price growth,"" Yoon said, who sees the BOK raising interest rates twice this year, in the second and third quarters. Analysts expect the BOK to resume raising interest rates from the second quarter this year, to take the base rate to 1.75% by end-2022.That would put South Korea well ahead of its major Asian peers and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which are only beginning to turn more hawkish as they navigate tentative economic recoveries and persistent virus outbreaks.Governor Lee's news conference starts at 0220 GMT, his last before he steps down.It is unclear whether President Moon Jae-in will name a new governor before the March 9 presidential election or leave that decision to the next leader of the country."

Food and gasoline probably will cost more and the supply chain issues that have bedeviled the economy for the past two years likely will persist or even intensify.But could the Russia-Ukraine conflict somehow tip the U.S. economy into recession? It seems unlikely at this point, though anything is possible.related investing newsThe Fed could enact a 'substitute' interest rate hike at its June meetingJeff Cox13 hours ago""What we've seen is oil prices have gone up, and equity prices at least initially retreated on all of this. Together, that's a mild — stress mild — stagflationary hit to the economy,"" Wells Fargo chief economist Jay Bryson said. ""It's going to push inflation higher than it is, and it's probably going to slow growth. But it's probably not enough to push the economy into recession.""That view is in line with most Wall Street economists.Nevertheless, at a time when inflation is running at its highest level since the early 1980s, the last thing consumers need is more price pressure. Grain and energy commodity prices catapulted higher in recent weeks, bringing West Texas Intermediate prices up about 22% in 2022 and wheat up by double digits, before receding sharply Friday.  The importance of the two nations as agriculture exporters and producers of elements key to semiconductor manufacturing will exact an economic toll. But the implications shouldn't be major for a global economy that's still in a rebound phase from the depths of the pandemic.""Higher gasoline prices — that will affect consumer confidence. Does that mean the consumer is going to lock down spending? Probably not,"" Bryson said. ""Given the fact that omicron is receding and things are opening up, I think that's a countervailing force."" Neither country is a huge economic force, despite their abundance in agricultural products and Moscow's military might.Russia's total economic output is a little smaller than New York state's, while Ukraine's GDP is about the size of Nebraska's. Combined, the two countries are responsible for up to 30% of the world's wheat exports and 80% of the global sunflower seed production, according to Capital Economics.The tensions have roiled financial markets, coming as they do at a time when investors already were worried about tighter policy from inflation-fighting central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve.""The key effect will come through higher oil and natural gas prices,"" Capital Economics forecasters said in a note to clients. ""It now looks like average advanced economy inflation could still be as high as 4% by December ... Policymakers will be weighing the upside risks to inflation against the downside risks to activity."" Markets still largely expect the Fed to begin raising interest rates in March and continue doing so through 2022 and into 2023. Pricing has been volatile, but traders see up to seven quarter-percentage-point hikes this year, which would equate to one at each of the Federal Open Market Committee meetings.That prospect had been enough to whack stocks this year and send government bond yields surging higher. Combining that with geopolitical turmoil could make for a bad mix.""The impact via tighter financial conditions is the most unpredictable,"" Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and David Mericle said in a note. ""Past geopolitical risk events have only rarely been followed by a meaningful tightening in U.S. financial conditions, though it is hard to generalize to the current situation. A larger tightening in financial conditions and an increase in uncertainty facing businesses would further weigh on U.S. growth.""Goldman estimates each $10 per barrel increase in oil would raise core inflation excluding food and energy by 0.035 percentage points and headline inflation by 0.2 percentage points, but exacts just a 0.1 percentage point hit to U.S. GDP, which is coming off its fastest full-year growth since 1984.""The growth hit could be somewhat larger if geopolitical risk tightens financial conditions materially and increases uncertainty for businesses,"" the economists said.However, Goldman said it doesn't expect the events in Ukraine to deter the Fed from hiking. Past crises sometimes have triggered the Fed to ease policy, but ""inflation risk has created a stronger and more urgent reason for the Fed to tighten today than existed in past episodes,"" the firm said.Indeed, most Fed officials who spoke this week said they are watching the events, but they didn't indicate that they would change their mind about tightening. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Thursday that ""a strong case can be made for a 50-basis-point hike in March"" if the economic data continues to show a strong labor market and persistent inflation.Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin earlier this week compared the current conflict to Russia's annexing of Crimea in 2014 and said that event had little economic impact.""If this evolves like 2014, I don't think you're going to see much change to the underlying logic that I've talked about,"" Barkin said. ""But this is uncharted territory and we'll have to see where the world goes."""

2022-02-25,"Increased living costs for the lowest earners were more than triple their annual wage growth in 2021 — $1,837 versus $578, respectively, according to a report published by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.Middle and high earners largely broke even or came out ahead.Savings for the lowest-income Americans are still elevated but dwindling as they spend down federal benefits like stimulus checks and child tax credit payments, according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The lowest-income Americans are facing a financial conundrum: Inflation is eating into a substantial part of their household budgets, while savings built up during the Covid pandemic are starting to dwindle.Meanwhile, federal supports like monthly payments of the child tax credit and a pause on student loan payments have ended or will soon lapse. And officials have already warned of delayed tax refunds, which low earners generally rely on more than higher-earning families. Consumer prices in January rose 7.5% from a year earlier, the fastest annual pace in 40 years.However, households don't feel those price shocks equally.The lowest-income working households (which earn less than $20,000 a year) faced the highest inflation rate of any income group in 2021, according to an analysis by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.These families funneled more of their budgets to necessities like energy and transportation, prices of which grew more rapidly than other goods and services. Meanwhile, the lowest-paid workers were the beneficiaries of the biggest wage growth last year, as restaurants and other generally lower-paying employers competed for scarce talent.But higher living costs for the lowest earners were more than triple their extra annual pay — $1,837 versus $578, respectively, according to the Wharton School report published Tuesday.The dynamic means the lowest earners felt a decline in purchasing power in 2021, unless they were able to supplement earnings with other income like government benefits, according to Alexander Arnon, Zheli He and Xiaoyue Sun, who co-authored the report.  Higher earners fared better. Most households with $20,000 to $100,000 of annual income roughly broke even, while those with more than $100,000 came out ahead, according to the analysis.For example, those households with more than $150,000 of income saw their annual wage growth outpace rising living costs by roughly $2,000 (or, $7,431 versus $5,483, respectively).(Of course, experiences may vary within each income cohort. The analysis measures the median worker, or the one right in the middle of a group.)It may sound counterintuitive that the highest earners came out ahead if their wage growth lagged that of the lowest paid. But their raises came on top of higher starting incomes, amounting to more money in dollar terms than the lowest earners. Plus, high-paid workers were more likely to remain employed throughout the year and work full time, according to the study. Further, more than 90% of households with incomes below $20,000 spent more than they earned from working in 2021, according to the research — meaning many may have had to borrow or spend from savings to finance their lifestyles.And research suggests low earners, who saw their savings grow during the pandemic, may soon deplete that cash buffer.More from Personal Finance:Focus on what you can control when the stock market fallsWhen married filing separately makes sense for taxpayersGold prices are popping as Russia invades UkraineSavings among the lowest-income families were still 65% above pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, according to a JPMorgan Chase Institute analysis published Wednesday. (These households represent the bottom fourth of earners, with take-home income below about $26,000.)Their accounts were mainly buoyed by government benefits like stimulus checks, monthly payments of the child tax credit since July and enhanced unemployment benefits.But their balances had been 120% higher in March 2021 relative to two years earlier — suggesting a savings decline, according to the analysis.""They're still elevated, but clearly on a downward trend for lower-income families,"" according to Fiona Greig, co-president of the Institute and a co-author of the study. ""That implies that the pace of their income isn't quite keeping up with the pace of their expenditures,"" she added. Plus, their savings amounted to just under $1,300 at the end of 2021, which is ""not a huge amount of cash on hand [that will] fuel spending for months and months and months,"" Greig said.Expiring federal aid may stress their accounts even more. Monthly child tax credit payments lapsed at the end of 2021, and federal student loan payments are scheduled to resume in May, for example.Conversely, savings have been relatively stable for the highest earners (with more than $65,000 of income) during the pandemic, according to JPMorgan. Their balances remain about 30% to 35% over 2019 levels, or nearly $7,000 total.Higher earners were less likely to qualify for certain government assistance; their elevated savings were largely courtesy of reduced spending during the pandemic, on things like travel and entertainment."
2022-02-28,"Economic sanctions levied by the U.S. and allies have sent everyday Russians flocking to ATMs to wait in lines dozens deep in the hopes of withdrawing cash.Russians want to withdraw their rubles either to spend them on physical goods insulated from inflation or to swap them for stable currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro.A prolonged drop in the value of the ruble would ultimately translate into a lower standard of living for Russians. Any goods or commodities Moscow imports — from wheat and soybeans to medical supplies — will be magnitudes more expensive, as well as foreign travel. Penalties levied by the U.S. and foreign governments have crippled Russia's economy in the last 24 hours by freezing about half of the nation's central bank assets, U.S. officials say.The economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies have sent Russians scrambling to spend their rubles while withdrawing dollars, euros and other currencies from banks as the value of their local cash plunged.The U.S. penalties come in addition a growing effort to bar Russian banks from the SWIFT global payments system, the financial-messaging platform that links the globe's biggest banks. Preventing Russian banks from using the system quashes cross-border financing critical to a modern economy, including trade, foreign investments and central banking supports, according U.S. Treasury Department spokeswoman Lily Adams. ""The range of outcomes is wide and the ripple effects from the severe sanctions on Russia will have further consequences for the global economy, markets, and inflation,"" wrote Keith Lerner, chief markets strategist at Truist Advisory Services. ""The repercussions will be long lasting as the world rethinks the relationship they have with Russia.""But while markets sort out the high-level impact of sanctions, everyday Russians are already seeing the impact of the penalties. Many have clamored to ATMs to wait in lines dozens deep in the hopes of withdrawing cash before they're unable to exchange currency for groceries and other necessities.""Since Thursday, everyone has been running from ATM to ATM to get cash. Some are lucky, others not so much,"" St Petersburg resident, Pyotr, who declined to give his last name, told Reuters. Moscow's department of public transport warned city residents over the weekend that they could run into problems paying for fare using Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay because VTB Bank, one of the Russian lenders targeted by global sanctions, handles payments in the metropolis.By blocking the Russian government's access to its overseas bank accounts, the U.S. and its partners effectively close off Moscow's access to dollars, euros and yen. That ultimately restricts any Russian citizen's ability to purchase any goods not sold in rubles.""The Russian ruble has depreciated massively,"" said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies. ""Expect much higher inflation rates: The ruble depreciating meaning that people's savings are going to be wiped out."" Part of the problem is Russia's historic reliance on currencies beyond the ruble.Even in calmer times, the ruble was known for volatility. Average Russians and oligarchs alike needed a way to preserve the value of their wealth that wouldn't whipsaw on a day-to-day basis in an economy linked closely to the fate of the health of the energy sector.To help satisfy that demand for stability, Russia's central bank kept huge sums of its own wealth denominated in U.S. dollars to serve that need. But that means that the U.S. sanctions remove that critical financial anchor.""The unprecedented action we are taking today will significantly limit Russia's ability to use assets to finance its destabilizing activities, and target the funds [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his inner circle depend on to enable his invasion of Ukraine,"" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.Reflecting that fear, the ruble swooned following the Treasury Department latest efforts to freeze Russia's access to its American bank accounts. At one point, traders were asking for 110.77 rubles for every dollar, up from 83 rubles on Friday. At that time, rubles were worth 20% less than they were just a few days ago.

Any goods or commodities Moscow imports — from wheat and soybeans to medical supplies — will be magnitudes more expensive.Foreign travel is much more difficult given restrictions on Russian airlines and foreign reluctance to accept rubles in exchange for fare. And, if Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn't yield to the globe's demands to end its invasion, the country's factories and manufacturers may need to close thanks to closed trading routes.The Russian central bank, the Bank of Russia, stepped in early Monday to protect the country's financial system by raising interest rates to 20% from 9.5%. Russian official hope that the move will encourage savers to leave deposits in the banking system, prevent more bank runs and ensure that cash can still flow.The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble recovered somewhat following the central bank's action.But the central bank's efforts also mean it is now much more expensive to borrow in Russia and are likely to dampen economic growth even further.Investors are also increasingly worried that Moscow won't be able to pay off its debt with interest rates so high. The yield on a Russian dollar bond maturing in 2024 was last seen trading north of 13%, up from under 10% earlier in February.""The interest rate is going to put the Russian economy into a stranglehold,"" Sri-Kumar added.

2022-02-28,"The U.S. economy has bounced back at a stunning pace since 2020's coronavirus recession – yet this recovery has largely left behind Black women. Throughout much of the pandemic and consistently since December, Black women's unemployment (5.8%) has been significantly higher than that of Latinas, Asian women and white women, according to research from the National Women's Law Center. Experts point to several possible factors widening the recovery gap, with hiring discrimination, burnout and a lack of substantial benefits in lower-paid industries at the top of the list. ""If you look at the experiences of Black women in corporate America, the pattern is really clear: the workplace is worse for women of color than white women, and Black women consistently stand out as having the worst experience of all,"" Rachel Thomas, co-founder and CEO of Leanin.org, tells CNBC Make It. ""So Black women have been hit especially hard by the pandemic's economic downturn."" CNBC Make It spoke with Thomas and other experts about the main issues driving this economic gap and how employers can better support Black women in the workplace. Black women have shouldered a disproportionate share of front-line jobs throughout the coronavirus crisis that have put them at a higher risk of contracting the virus. More than 1 in 3 Black women have worked in front-line jobs, the NWLC reports, including roles as personal care aides, nursing assistants, cashiers and retail salespeople.These industries have been the hardest hit by the pandemic and continue to be vulnerable to coronavirus restrictions and shutdowns. The recovery of these jobs remains sluggish and uneven: in January, women only gained 52,000 jobs in leisure and hospitality, or about 34%, despite making up about 53% of the industry's workforce. Most of these jobs have required employees to show up in person, even at the height of the pandemic. Such conditions have put Black women in a compromised position as they tend to live in regions with higher transmission rates and are more likely to fall ill, Jasmine Tucker, the NWLC's director of research, says. ""A lot of these jobs don't offer fair paid leave or even sick leave policies, so every time you get sick, you risk losing your job,"" she explains. According to research from Lean In, 47% of Black women have gone to work during the pandemic when they had a good reason to stay home, whether that was being sick or not having child care. These high-risk, low-reward jobs have led Black women to a difficult choice: quit, or show up to work at the expense of their — and often their family's — well-being. The ongoing child-care crisis has hit Black mothers especially hard during the pandemic, pushing a lot of women out of the workforce. Black mothers tend to shoulder more child-care responsibilities than their white counterparts, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, and are also more likely to be the primary wage earners in their families. Without access to affordable child care, many have had to quit their jobs.More than two thirds of working Black mothers are also single. ""Large numbers of Black women have left the workforce because they are mothers, or single mothers, and had to make a difficult choice to leave their jobs to take care of their children during the pandemic,"" Thomas says. ""The lack of affordable child-care and flexibility within their jobs has just created a very untenable, unstable situation for mothers, especially mothers of color."" These barriers have not only made it difficult for Black women to find meaningful full-time employment, but also to re-enter the labor force. The NWLC reports that nearly 30% of Black women who are unemployed have been out of work for six months or longer. Although the 2020 murder of George Floyd and the pandemic brought a renewed focus on diversity, equity and inclusion practices at companies, Black women – and other people of color – continue to experience racism and microaggressions in the workforce.""Black women are still facing hiring discrimination, and if they've been unemployed for long periods of time, they could feel even more discouraged from applying to jobs,"" Tucker notes. The barriers for securing a job are higher for Black women because ""as a Black woman, you're facing all of the biases that go with being a woman, along with the biases that go with being a woman of color,"" Thomas explains. Black women also experience more – and more acute – microaggressions than other groups of women.In its annual ""Women in the Workplace"" report, Lean In and McKinsey & Company found that Black women are more likely than white women to be on the receiving end of disrespectful and ""othering"" behavior. About 17% of Black have been confused with someone else of the same race/ethnicity, compared to 4% of white women. Employers can help mitigate this economic gap by reviewing their benefits, hiring and promotional practices and updating them to be more equitable for women of color. Such meaningful changes could include including more women of color in the workplace planning and hiring process and broadening paid leave policies, as well as designing clearer, structured promotion and mentorship opportunities for Black women.""A lot of companies don't truly know how many women of color they're hiring or promoting,"" Thomas says. ""To make sure your hiring and promotion processes are fair, you need to track how women of color are moving through your organization."" While the past two years have spurred some leaders to pay closer attention to the challenges Black women face in the workforce, it's important to recognize that Black women have been dealing with these issues long before the pandemic – and it could take a long time to see sustainable progress.""We like to find the silver lining, but the reality is, things have been really bad for Black women,"" Nikki Tucker, the head of social at Leanin.org, says. ""The pandemic has just finally opened a lot of people's eyes to the things Black women have been going through all of our lives.""Check out:Feeding America's CEO on overcoming imposter syndrome in her career: 'Being someone else was not working'This nonprofit is helping companies rebuild their workplaces to meaningfully support Black womenBlack employees make up just 7.4% of the tech workforce—these nonprofits are working to change thatSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"

2022-03-01,"The U.S.-led response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine could breathe new life into President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.The other major theme of the speech: Biden's economic agenda.  WASHINGTON — When President Joe Biden delivers his first official State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the unified global response to Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine is poised to overshadow the other major theme of the speech: Biden's economic agenda. Biden and his team spent months working on the economic agenda portion of the hourlong speech, according to White House aides. The result is a ""strong case"" for Biden to make about how well the U.S. economy has rebounded in the past year, they said.By contrast, aides had just days to pull together his comments on Russia and Ukraine — a war that is changing by the minute. If this were any other year, a presidential speech on the nationwide economic recovery and his future domestic agenda would be more likely to resonate with American voters than a speech about a foreign war thousands of miles away. But this year is different.  Biden will be addressing an electorate that polls show consistently feels disconnected from the economic recovery that Biden has overseen in his first year in office.The numbers are clear: Since Biden took office last January, the U.S. economy has achieved the fastest job growth on record and the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years. A Washington Post ABC poll released last week found that 75% of Americans believed the economy is in either ""poor"" or ""not so good"" shape.This disconnect is not new. For months, Biden has insisted — and the numbers have shown — that America is undergoing a period of historic economic growth. But this has nonetheless failed to resonate with voters, a majority of whom feel pessimistic about the economy and frustrated by high inflation. Biden's speech will acknowledge these anxieties Tuesday, a White House official said. But the president will not be unveiling any novel approaches to the problem. Instead, Biden will ""call on Congress"" to pass various elements of his ""Build Back Better"" bill without referring to the doomed bill by name. Biden's hope of passing the once-in-a-generation social safety net expansion collided late last year with West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's alarm over rising inflation. Manchin cited inflation as the reason he pulled his support for the bill after it had already passed the House. Biden will ""call on Congress"" at least 10 times in Tuesday's address to pass various proposals, according to a White House fact sheet on the speech. They include everything from increased funding for Pell grants to a $15 minimum wage to paid family leave. Still, the fact that Biden is resorting to public pressure on the Democratically controlled Senate and House, asking them to take action, only serves to highlight the hurdles Biden faces to fully enacting his legislative agenda.  While Biden's domestic policy agenda appears to be mired in intraparty squabbles, it is a very different story 6,000 miles away in Ukraine. On Ukraine, Biden and his foreign policy team are leading the rest of the world, revitalizing the NATO alliance and stepping up to the challenge that Russian President Vladimir Putin poses to the rules-based international order — one that has maintained relative peace in Europe for nearly 80 years. On Tuesday morning, tens of thousands of Russian troops were surrounding the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Farther to the east, Russian forces shelled a public square in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, killing hundreds.In response to the invasion, a loose coalition of large and small democracies around the world has banded together to impose severe restrictions on Russia's central bank and sanctioned its richest citizens, its airlines and its state-run media. The goal of the effort is to isolate Moscow and force the Kremlin to pay a high price economically for launching a war of choice.Biden and the United States have been at the forefront of this coalition, which includes G-7 members, NATO allies, rich countries such as Japan and developing countries such as Ghana and even traditionally neutral countries such as Switzerland and Monaco. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden will ""talk about the steps we've taken to not only support the Ukrainian people with military and economic assistance, but also the steps he's taken to build a global coalition imposing crippling financial sanctions on President Putin, his inner circle and the Russian economy."" Biden will also address ""the importance of the United States as a leader in the world — standing up for values and standing up for global norms,"" she told reporters Monday.In just the past week, Biden has held scores of leader-to-leader calls with U.S. and NATO allies to coordinate both U.S. support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. He has also deployed thousands of U.S. troops to help shore up the defenses of NATO member states to whom Russia poses the most immediate threat. At the same time, Biden's secretaries of state and defense have requested and distributed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of additional weapons to Ukrainian troops and humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing the front lines. This combined U.S. military, diplomatic, economic and humanitarian response has earned praise for Biden from both Democrats and Republicans. ""President Biden's leadership in the Ukraine crisis has been truly impressive,"" conservative intellectual Bill Kristol tweeted Monday. Even more importantly, early polls show that average Americans of all parties are coalescing around support for Ukraine and opposition to Russia's invasion.For Republican voters to back Biden's position on anything is exceedingly rare, and all the more so because the most recent Republican president, Donald Trump, was such an ardent supporter and defender of Putin. Biden is scheduled to deliver the annual speech at 9 p.m. in person at the Capitol to both chambers of Congress as well as several Supreme Court justices and his Cabinet.  CNBC PoliticsRead more of CNBC's politics coverage:Republicans walk out of debt ceiling talks, say White House isn't being 'reasonable'GOP Sen.

2022-03-01,"  The latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Confidence Index remains near an all-time low, but has not declined further even as inflation deepened and hit small businesses harder.Yet only 33% of small business owners say they approve of Biden, the lowest the survey has recorded since Biden took office, and an equal percentage describe business conditions as ""good."" Biden's approval rating lost the most ground with Democrats in the recent survey, while support among independents ticked up, though other recent public polling shows declining support among independents and economic issues weighing on approval numbers. As President Joe Biden prepares to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday night amid a war in Ukraine that has enflamed global tensions, added to stock market volatility and increased inflationary pressures on the economy, small business owners are among the audiences that Biden needs to win back.Biden's approval rating with small business owners remains underwater, according to the recent CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q1 2022.One-third (33%) of small business owners approve of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president, while 67% disapprove, slightly lower than where his approval rating was in Q4 2021 and the lowest approval marks for the president since he took office.While the small business community skews conservative overall and Biden's approval rating is extremely low among Republicans (5%), in Q1 it slipped the most among small business owners who are Democrats (89% in Q4, 83% now). However, Biden's approval increased among independents (33% in Q4, 42% now), which is in contrast to other recent public polling of Americans who don't affiliate with either major party.Along racial and ethnic lines, Biden's approval rating is lowest among white business owners (NET -42), but he still gets high marks from Black small business owners (NET +22).Biden's overall approval from small business owners matches the 33% of owners who describe current business conditions as good.The survey was conducted among over 2,000 small business owners across the U.S. before the outbreak of war in Ukraine. The war will be a dominant theme in the speech, but with oil prices hitting a seven-year high on Tuesday and wheat prices surging to a level not seen since 2008 as a result of the conflict, Biden will also be pressed to address the inflationary pressures that were already sweeping through the small business sector and impacting business decisions and confidence on Main Street.The White House has been signaling that in addition to a focus on Russia and Ukraine, President Biden will use the speech to make his case for a strong economy, while acknowledging inflation.""As CNBC and NFIB surveys show, small business owners continue to struggle with economic headwinds including workforce shortages, rising inflation, and supply chain disruptions with little relief in sight,"" said Kevin Kuhlman, director of government relations at NFIB. ""Early materials and messaging appear that President Biden will acknowledge the challenges of inflation,"" he said, but he added that NFIB remains worried about policy proposals including paid family and medical leave mandates and federal minimum wage hikes, which could further pressure small businesses, and continued focus on union-friendly legislation.The White House highlighted paid leave mandates, a higher minimum wage, as well as its support for the labor union-supported Pro Act in an outline of economic priorities on Monday. ""Things have changed dramatically on the international front, which raises the stakes even more for the President at home,"" said Karen Kerrigan, president & CEO of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. ""At a critical time such as this, our President needs the confidence and support of the American people behind him.""For the small business community, she said, this means a speech that addresses priority concerns like inflation, health care and healing the economy rather than major tax or regulatory policies that will drive costs higher or fuel inflation further for small businesses. ""The American people will hear a lot about how he's going to lower their costs, how he's going to continue to build a strong economy over the long term,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an MSNBC interview this week.""We've seen and heard from members about squeezes in supply chains and more corporate concentration further stifling supply chains and driving up prices,"" said Didier Trinh, the director of policy and political Impact for the progressive small business trade group Main Street Alliance.He cited shippers as one example of an issue where Biden can reach out to small business, and the president is expected to highlight efforts to target the shipping industry. Trinh said tax fairness and a focus on large corporations remain an issue where progress is also possible to benefit small businesses.""Small businesses are maybe not in an emergency situation like a year ago, but they are far from fully recovered,"" Trinh said.He and other small business experts cited support for small business health-care costs related to the Affordable Care Act legislation and tax credits as another area for bipartisan cooperation.

More on Main Street say they do with Covid relief gone An increasing number (47%) of small business owners are raising their prices to offset increases in the costs of supplies, and more (32%) plan to do so if inflation remains elevated, which is their expectation, according to the survey. Over 80% of small business owners expect inflation to still be a problem six months from now (55% say that is ""very likely""), while just 28% of small business owners are confident in the Federal Reserve's ability to control inflation.Overall, 31% of small business owners say inflation is the biggest risk to their business now, topping supply chain disruptions (23%), Covid-19 (20%), and labor shortages (12%). President Biden's attempt to highlight a strong economy was outlined in an administration fact sheet posted ahead of the address and which emphasized that ""entrepreneurship and business investment rebounded, the economy achieved its fastest job growth in American history, the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years,"" and that there was a ""historic shift from the old, outdated trickle-down approach to one that centers on workers, families, and small businesses.""But inflation remains the polling issue that dominates over broader economic gains.""Inflation is an issue no incumbent administration wants in the headlines because they get blamed for it and can't control it, certainly not in the short term,"" said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. ""It is also a great issue for the opposition party since no one likes inflation, they don't have to have a specific 'cure' for it, and they can blame the incumbents."" Jeff Jones, Gallup senior editor, said its data shows varying economic sentiment depending on the specific issue, such as jobs and the stock market, but overall views of the economy have turned more negative since inflation became a greater concern. ""The job market is right up there with the best we've ever seen, so it is definitely a positive ... but it looks to me like inflation is overshadowing everything else,"" Jones said.""Inflation is an effective issue for Republicans to seize upon to think ill of Biden while Democrats downplay it. But independents are quite concerned and that is a problem for Biden and for Democratic candidates,"" Franklin said.Although independent small business owners in the CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll were slightly more positive quarter-over-quarter on Biden (though still expressing majority disapproval), the most recent Quinnipiac poll released in mid-February found inflation topped the list of the ""most urgent issues"" facing the country, at 27%, and that independents were more closely aligned with Republicans on this issue. Among Republicans, 36% cited inflation, versus 13% of Democrats who cited inflation as the top concern. But among independents, inflation was also the top issue, at 32%.The Quinnipiac survey also found a majority of Americans expecting Russia to start a war.The Quinnipiac polling finds that 6 in 10 Americans feel the economy is getting worse, even though the majority describe their financial condition as good or excellent. Nearly three-quarters, 72%, say increased prices on food and gas have caused them to change spending habits.In its polling, more than half of independents say they disapprove of the way Biden is handling his job. His overall approval rating in the Quinnipiac survey of 35% in February was consistent with approval ratings since October, which was the first time Quinnipiac saw Biden's approval rating dip below 40%. ""It hasn't been able to get up above since then and independents are not helping those numbers,"" said Mary Snow, Quinnipiac polling analyst.Similar to the CNBC survey, Biden's approval rating on the economy in the Quinnipiac poll (33%) was the lowest it has been since he took office.""It is up to him to re-set his policies and political strategy by working across the aisle and to govern as a moderate like he said he would when he ran for office,"" Kerrigan said.

2022-03-02,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday he still sees interest rate hikes ahead though he noted the ""implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain"" from the Ukraine war.Powell called the labor market ""extremely tight"" and said inflation has risen well above the Fed's 2% target.His remarks are part of mandatory appearances this week before House and Senate committees in Congress. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell still sees interest rate hikes coming, but noted Wednesday that the Russia-Ukraine war has injected uncertainty into the outlook.Powell said he sees a series of quarter-percentage-point increases coming, though he left open the possibility of moving more aggressively should inflation persist.In remarks prepared for dual appearances this week before House and Senate committees in Congress, the central bank chief acknowledged the ""tremendous hardship"" the Russian invasion of Ukraine is causing.""The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, and we will be monitoring the situation closely,"" Powell said.""The near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain,"" he added. ""Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.""Later, he said the Fed wants to get inflation under control, but ""the bottom line is that we will proceed but we will proceed carefully as we learn more about the implications of the Ukraine war on the economy.""The observations come amid 40-year highs for inflation in the U.S., complicated by a Ukraine war that has driven oil prices to around their highest levels in a decade. Consumer prices increased 7.5% from a year ago in January, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed its strongest 12-month gain since 1983.Powell and his fellow policymakers have been indicating for weeks that they plan to start raising benchmark interest rates to tackle inflation. He reiterated the stance Wednesday that the process will involve ""interest rate increases,"" along with indications that the Fed eventually will start reducing its bond holdings.""We will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched while promoting a sustainable expansion and a strong labor market,"" he said. ""We have phased out our net asset purchases. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month.""Powell said the likely path for rate hikes will be increments of a quarter percentage point, though he said he would be open to more aggressive moves if inflation gets worse.""We're going to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain moment,"" he said under questioning from House Financial Services Committee members. ""To the extent that inflation comes in higher or is more persistently high than that, we would be prepared to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings."" The Fed will start cutting the size of its asset holdings after rate hikes have begun, he added.Since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, the Fed has been buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities at the fastest pace ever, driving the total holdings on the central bank balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion.Powell said the reduction will be conducted ""in a predictable manner,"" largely through allowing some proceeds from the bonds to roll off each month rather than reinvesting them.On the economy, the chairman said he still expects inflation to decelerate through the year as supply chain issues are resolved. He called the labor market ""extremely tight"" and noted strong wage gains, particularly for lower earners and minorities.""We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation,"" he said. ""We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion, and that is only possible in an environment of price stability.""Markets have fully priced in a rate increase at the March 15-16 meeting but have decreased expectations for the rest of the year since the Ukraine war began, according to CME group data. Traders are now pricing in five quarter-percentage-point increases that would take the benchmark federal funds rate from its current range of 0%-0.25% to 1.25%-1.5%."

2022-03-02,"Everyday investors in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds likely have limited exposure to Russian debt and stock.However, some stock funds allocate at least 10% of their assets to Russia, according to Morningstar. Bond funds are relatively more subdued, allocating at most about 4.5% to 8% to Russian debt, the firm said.Some funds have seen big losses in recent days. The West has targeted sanctions at Russia after it invaded Ukraine. Americans who invest in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have largely been insulated from financial exposure to Russia amid its conflict with Ukraine.The reasons are twofold: First, fund managers who buy Russian debt or Russian company stock generally do so in small quantities; second, funds that buy these securities (which are generally focused on the developing world) are often a fringe part of investors' overall portfolios.  ""The reality is most people in a 401(k) might have a really tiny exposure to Russian stocks and/or bonds, probably under 1%,"" said Karin Anderson, director of North American fixed income strategies at Morningstar, which tracks data on mutual funds and ETFs.However, there are a handful of stock and bond funds with much bigger stakes in Russia, according to data provided by Morningstar Direct. Some took a big hit in recent days, due to Western sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's economy that may be ratcheted up even further.  The 10 stock funds with the biggest exposure allocate at least 9% of their assets to Russia, according to Morningstar data. The two largest — the iShares MSCI Russia ETF and the VanEck Russia ETF — hold 95% and 94% of their assets in Russian companies, respectively, according to Morningstar.The most-exposed bond funds allocate to Russia in much smaller shares than stock funds. The top 10 hold roughly 4.5% to 8% of their total assets in Russian debt, according to Morningstar. The Western Asset Macro Opportunities mutual fund has the largest allocation, about 8.4%, it said.More from Personal Finance:Russia-Ukraine crisis: How to avoid fundraising scamsYou might be subsidizing a colleague's 401(k) feesBiden reiterates $400,000 tax pledge to fund agendaThe stock and bond funds are a mix of actively managed and index funds. The latter try to replicate a particular stock or bond benchmark, whereas fund managers in the former category have more latitude to select securities according to a particular fund strategy.Importantly, the Morningstar data reflects the most recent publicly available data on fund holdings (as of Dec. 31 or Jan. 31, depending on the fund). Active fund managers may have since altered their holdings in Russian stock and debt given the invasion and resulting economic sanctions. For example, disclosures peg the GQG Partners Emerging Markets Equity Fund's Russia stock allocation at more than 16% of holdings. However, the firm on Friday said it only had about 3.7% of assets exposed to Russian stock, according to Morningstar.To a certain extent, a reduction in a fund's Russia stake will occur naturally if the value of those holdings declines. (In other words, active decisions from fund managers may not be primary cause.)Benchmarks that incorporate Russia may ultimately remove the country, effectively stripping country exposure from certain index funds. An official at index provider MSCI hinted at that eventuality on Monday, for example, citing an inability to transact in Russian securities."
2022-03-03,"The Group of Seven, or G-7, major economies have imposed unprecedented punitive sanctions against the Central Bank of Russia along with widespread measures by the West against the country's oligarchs and officials.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Tuesday told a French radio station that the aim of the latest round of sanctions was to ""cause the collapse of the Russian economy."" LONDON — Western nations have responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with a raft of sanctions intended to cripple the country's economy, and economists suggest it could work.The Group of Seven, or G-7, major economies have imposed unprecedented punitive sanctions against the Central Bank of Russia along with widespread measures by the West against the country's oligarchs and officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.Key Russian banks have been barred from the SWIFT international payments system, preventing them from secure international communication and ostracizing them from much of the global financial system. Sanctions announced by the U.S. over the weekend also targeted the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.They also effectively prohibit Western investors from doing business with the central bank and freeze its overseas assets, not least the vast foreign currency reserves the CBR has used as a buffer against the depreciation of local assets.In the latest crackdown on Moscow, U.S. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that Russian flights would be banned from U.S. airspace, following similar decisions by the EU and Canada.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Tuesday told a French radio station that the aim of the latest round of sanctions was to ""cause the collapse of the Russian economy.""The Russian ruble has plunged since Russia invaded its neighbor last week and hit an all-time low of 109.55 against the dollar on Wednesday morning. Russian stocks have also seen massive sell-offs. The Moscow stock exchange was closed for a third consecutive day on Wednesday as authorities looked to stem the bleeding in local asset prices. Meanwhile, the country's largest lender, Sberbank, exited its European operations and saw its London-listed shares fall more than 95% to trade at a penny. Shares of the country's other major players on the London Stock Exchange, including Rosneft and Lukoil, also collapsed.The CBR on Monday more than doubled the country's key interest rate from 9.5% to 20% in a bid to curtail the fallout, but analysts believe the move to freeze its foreign exchange reserves is the key to blocking its ability to stabilize the Russian economy.Swedish economist and former Atlantic Council senior fellow Anders Aslund tweeted Wednesday that the Western sanctions effectively ""took down Russian finances in one day.""""The situation is likely to become worse than in 1998 because now there is no positive end. All Russia's capital markets appear to be wiped out & they are unlikely to return with anything less than profound reforms,"" he added.Facing a 'serious financial crisis'""While previously the CBR could rely on its reserves to smooth out any temporary volatility in the Ruble, it is no longer able to do so. Instead, it will need to adjust rates and other non-market measures to stabilize the Ruble,"" said Clemens Grafe, chief Russia economist at Goldman Sachs.""Limiting Ruble volatility without adequate reserves is more difficult and the Ruble has already sold off, with implications for inflation and rates.""Goldman Sachs has raised its end-of-year forecast for Russian inflation to 17% year on year from a previous projection of 5%, with risks skewed to the upside given that the ruble could sell off further, or the CBR may be forced to hike rates more to maintain stability.Economic growth is also expected to take a severe hit, and the Wall Street giant cut its 2022 GDP (gross domestic product) forecast from a 2% expansion to a 7% contraction year on year, though Grafe acknowledged uncertainty surrounding these figures.""Financial conditions have tightened to a similar level to 2014 (Russia's annexation of Crimea), and hence we think domestic demand will contract by 10% [year on year] or slightly more,"" Grafe said. ""While exports are, in principle, not significantly restricted by the sanctions so far, we expect them to contract by 5%yoy because of the physical disruption of exports through the Black Sea ports, which are instrumental for dry bulk exports, and the risk of sanctions reducing other exports.""This scale of decline is similar to the 7.5% fall during the 2008/9 financial crisis and the 6.8% contraction during Russia's financial crisis in 1998.""The ratcheting up of Western sanctions, alongside a tightening of financial conditions and the prospect of a banking crisis, mean that Russia's economy is likely to experience a sharp contraction this year,"" Liam Peach, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a note Tuesday.Although the outlook remains highly uncertain, Capital Economics' baseline forecast is for a 5% contraction in Russian GDP in 2022 compared with its previous forecast for 2.5% growth, and for annual inflation to reach 15% this summer.Peach suggested that a worst-case scenario for Russia in terms of international sanctions would involve restrictions on the flow of oil and gas, which represents about half of all goods exports and a third of government revenue.""Restricting these would also choke off a key source of dollar incomes for energy companies that have FX debts and perhaps cause a much more significant financial crisis in Russia,"" he added.Depth of recession depends on exports, ChinaSteven Bell, chief economist at BMO Global Asset Management, said Russia is now facing a ""serious financial crisis,"" with the role of China becoming ever more important to Moscow due to its demand for raw materials and energy.""Russia has also moved a large portion of their foreign exchange reserves into the Chinese currency and switched their payment systems to Chinese banks. China may hold the key to Russia's ability to sustain the conflict,"" Bell added.As yet, there are no sanctions on Russian exports, and SWIFT exclusions are targeted at specific banks to allow export payments to continue being processed. Goldman Sachs' Grafe suggested that this might not be the case much longer. ""The willingness of the G7 to incur costs is rising and it might ultimately imply that restricting Russian exports and accepting higher commodity prices could become politically feasible,"" Grafe said.A major constraint for Russia is its inability to use its foreign exchange reserves to underwrite the ruble, but Grafe suggested this could be overcome by changing the ruble's reference currency to the Chinese yuan from the U.S. dollar.""This would also allow the CBR and the Ministry of Finance to adhere to their fiscal rule that channels the excess fiscal savings due to higher oil prices into foreign assets,"" he said.However, creating a cross-currency market would need full cooperation from Beijing, which Goldman Sachs sees as unlikely given the risk to China of secondary sanctions for helping Russia sidestep Western sanctions.China's banking regulator on Wednesday said the country opposes and will not join financial sanctions against Russia. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has thus far refused to call the attack on Ukraine an invasion, instead promoting diplomacy and negotiations."

Oil prices are spiraling higher on supply concerns as the Russia-Ukraine crisis develops, and this could lead to demand destruction and an economic recession, according to an oil analyst.""I'm concerned that we don't have enough oil at all here, and we need to go to $120 to $150 [per barrel], and then we get into economic destruction,"" said Paul Sankey of Sankey Research.The firm sees oil trading between $100 and $150 per barrel until the situation in Ukraine is resolved, according to a research note.International benchmark Brent crude futures jumped 3.24% to $116.59 per barrel, after earlier crossing the $119 level. U.S. crude futures climbed 3.26% to $114.21 per barrel.Oil cargoes from Russia ""simply aren't moving"" following the invasion and news of sanctions, despite lower prices, Sankey told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Thursday.""There's a major, physical, immediate outage that caught an already tight market with very low inventories,"" he said.Everyone is worried that the elevated prices will be highly recessionary, destroy oil demand and slow down many economies, he added. Despite the extreme oil price moves, Sankey suggested that it may have been the right call for OPEC and its allies to stick to their small production increase in April as planned.""The scale of the emergency here is so severe that you probably don't want to be doing what the Western governments are doing, which is … releasing emergency stocks, leaving yourself with even lower stocks,"" he said.""By the same token, if Saudi and the UAE run down their spare capacity, well, you don't know what's going to happen next,"" he added.Pointing to countries such as Libya and Iraq, Sankey said ""any risky supply source might go missing,"" and oil prices could then leap to $200 per barrel.OPEC+ is ""probably just sitting on their hands here, to see how this plays out,"" he said. Not everyone agrees.""I think it's an enormous mistake,"" said David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy.He singled out Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which have spare capacity to pump more oil, and said they are punishing their primary future market — Asia.""They're putting themselves on the wrong side of history, making themselves an unreliable supplier and reminding the world why we wanted to get off Middle East oil in the first place,"" he said.— CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report."

Costs for food and goods like smartphones may also rise, according to economists.Inflation would largely result from shortages and rising costs of raw materials like oil, wheat and metals like palladium — all of which Russia is a major producer.   It would also come at a time when consumer prices are already rising at their fastest annual pace in 40 years. Yet some of the inflation (if it comes to pass) will likely take months to appear, economists said. The timing and scale are hard to predict given the fluidity of the military conflict, novelty of Western sanctions against Russia and possibility of yet harsher ones.""What makes projecting this stuff so difficult is, all these measures are so new and so unprecedented as a model,"" according to Julia Friedlander, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and a former advisor on sanctions policy at the U.S. Treasury Department.""What's it like to take the 11th largest economy offline in the course of days?"" she said.The Federal Reserve is also expected to start raising interest rates this month to fight inflation. The price of gasoline is how consumers are most likely to feel the war's inflationary impact in the short term, according to economists. Indeed, gas prices have risen since Russia's saber-rattling started, even before the Feb. 24 invasion.Crude oil is the main component of gasoline.It accounts for 56% of what Americans pay at the pump, according to the Energy Information Administration. That's why higher oil prices often translate to higher gas prices.The Ukraine-Russia conflict pushed U.S. oil prices on Thursday to their highest level since 2008, at well over $100 a barrel. The global price jumped to a high unseen since 2012.More from Personal Finance:Have buyer's remorse? Inflation may be to blameHow to qualify for in-state college tuitionA 4-day workweek doesn't mean less workGasoline prices, in turn, edged up to $3.61 a gallon, on average, as of Monday — a jump of 33 cents a gallon since the beginning of 2022, according to federal data.If high oil prices are sustained, the average cost may soon breach $4 a gallon, according to Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.That price would translate to an additional $75 billion of annual spending for households to fill up their gas tanks (relative to prices of $3.40 a gallon at the end of January), Hunter wrote in a research note Tuesday. The dynamic could cut households' disposable income by 0.5%, he said.""The single biggest issue is definitely what's happening to oil prices,"" Hunter said of the crisis' consumer impact. ""It looks like there's more pain to come, unfortunately.""President Joe Biden acknowledged the likely financial sting in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. The U.S. and 30 other countries are releasing 60 million barrels of oil from strategic stockpiles, only the fourth time such a coordinated release has occurred, to try diluting the price surge.""A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world,"" Biden said. ""These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home."" The Russia-Ukraine conflict has the potential to impact food prices — though the effects will likely be felt most acutely overseas, economists said.Russia is the world's largest wheat exporter. Ukraine and Russia together account for almost 30% of global wheat exports.Wheat prices on Wednesday surged to their highest level in 14 years. That could impact prices for bread, pasta, cereal, baked goods and other wheat-reliant foods, if producers pass higher costs on to consumers.Russia and Ukraine are also major exporters of other food products like barley, sunflower seed oil and corn.However, the U.S. is a net exporter of agricultural commodities, particularly wheat, corn and soybeans, which will likely dilute any impact, according to Hunter.""I wouldn't expect grocery prices to suddenly start rising now because of these moves,"" he said. ""If they're sustained, it's something you could potentially start to see over the coming months.""Higher food prices are much more of an issue for the developing world, Friedlander said. Turkey, Egypt and Kazakhstan are the three biggest buyers of Russian wheat, respectively, for example.""I don't think it will affect the price of bread in Ohio,"" Friedlander said. Russia is the world's largest producer of palladium, supplying about a third of global demand.Palladium is a metal used to manufacture semiconductor chips, also known as microchips, which are found in a range of consumer electronic products like smartphones, computers, TVs and digital cameras. Ukraine and Russia also account for the bulk of U.S. neon supply, also used for chip production.Palladium is also a key metal used in catalytic converters, which control tailpipe emissions from cars.""[That] will trickle down to production of high-end technology that relies on the Russian market,"" Friedlander said of Russia's palladium exports.""It'll take a while for the price to rise in the iPhone you buy, but eventually that could [happen],"" she added."
2022-03-04,"  Nonfarm payrolls rose by 678,000 in February and the unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, with the job gains much stronger than expected.However, the job recovery has not been the same for small businesses, with companies with fewer than 50 employees still challenged by labor shortages.52% of all small business owners said that it has gotten harder to find qualified people to hire compared to a year ago, according to a recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey. The latest nonfarm payrolls report shows a labor market nearing a recovery to pre-pandemic levels, but small business owners across the U.S. say that finding and keeping qualified employees remains one of their biggest challenges.February job growth posting its biggest monthly gain since July, with nonfarm payrolls for the month rising by 678,000 and the unemployment rate at 3.8%, its lowest level since before the pandemic, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.Across 2021, 6.665 million jobs were added in the U.S., a figure noted by President Joe Biden in this week's State of the Union address as the largest single-year gain in American history. With the bounce back, the job market is about one million (1.14 million) employed workers short of where it was pre-pandemic, but there is still a large gap in filling open positions, which stood at over 10 million at the end of last year.Main Street is one area where this labor struggle remains. In February, companies with 500 or more workers added 552,000 positions, according to ADP's private payrolls report from earlier this week. That was responsible for almost all of the job gains tracked by ADP, while companies with fewer than 50 employees recorded a loss of 96,000 employees during the month.Fifty-two percent of all small business owners said that it has gotten harder to find qualified people to hire compared to a year ago, according to a recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey covering the first quarter of 2022. That is up from 50% in Q4 2021.Twenty-nine percent of small business owners also said that they have positions that have been open for at least three months that they've been unable to fill, and 77% of the small businesses with more than 50 employees saying that they expect turnover to likely be a problem for their business six months from now. ""Every data point from every possible source that we have on the economy right now is indicating that we're in an incredibly challenging hiring market,"" said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at SurveyMonkey, which conducts the survey for CNBC. ""The unemployment rate is low but inflation is high, so wages have to be high to attract workers.""The latest nonfarm payroll report shows a softening in the sharp wage inflation, as wages were up just 1 cent an hour, or 0.03%, compared to estimates for a 0.5% gain. The year-over-year increase was 5.1%, well below the expectation of 5.8%. Wronski said that while there has been an influx of newly eligible workers looking for new jobs amid the 'Great Resignation,' ""it hasn't gotten easier for small businesses to hire.""The latest data from NFIB's monthly jobs report in February showed 22% of small business owners reporting that labor quality was their top business problem, and the percentage who cited labor costs as the top business problem remained near a recent 48-year record high.Jennifer Park, the owner of WearEver Jewelry in Alexandria, Virginia, said that she has not only been challenged to find qualified employees but to keep those she hires as well.After an employee left her role to take care of her child in July, Park said she posted a job listing on SimpleHired, which garnered her just 21 applicants over a two-month period. While she hired someone from that process, that person just quit three weeks after starting without notice, leaving her back at the starting point. She also hired someone who worked for roughly two weeks but then tested positive for Covid-19 and stepped away following that, and she has had several applicants just not show up for scheduled interviews.""It takes a lot of time to look for people, a lot of time and money to train them, do background checks, and really show them how to do this job,"" Park said. ""It's just been super frustrating.""Park said that she believes a few factors are playing into why it has been so hard to find new employees, with one of them being that many workers, especially women, are having to stay home to take care of children.Recent research from the National Women's Law Center suggested that were nearly 1.1 million fewer women in the labor workforce in February 2022 compared to 2020 while men have recouped all of their job losses since the pandemic began, a gap that is being furthered by childcare concerns.""We're not even getting those kinds of applicants, because if they have little children, they've had someone to care for them or they haven't had school to send them to,"" Park said.She also noted the realities of working in a retail environment for a small business, which often requires weekend work, as being ""lower on the rung"" compared to other jobs that are out there.While Park said she has tried to increase the perks that she's offering and has increased the opportunity of things like sales commissions, she is also facing the same challenges as nearly every other business in terms of rising costs and supply chain problems which limit what she can do.

Leisure and hospitality led job gains in February, adding 179,000 for the month, but on Main Street employers remained challenged to find the workers they need.Marie Raboin, the co-founder of cider company Brix Cider in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, said that for her 20-person company, part of the challenge has been attracting people back into the restaurant and foodservice sector as opportunities in other industries have expanded.""I think service industry workers were able to go and find 9-to-5 jobs that paid as good as they were making the service industry, and they got nights and weekends off, and benefits,"" she said. ""I don't blame them, I don't blame anyone for doing that and I get it."" Raboin has raised wages and looked to offer other perks like free yoga classes at a local studio, but that has not resulted in an influx of new applicants. Recently, she said, she received one application for a job that was posted for three weeks.""We're finding turnover is costing us more money than if we were to just like suck it up and work a lot more hours,"" she said. ""We're willing to be more patient than just kind of hiring to hire.""Raboin said she expects hiring to be difficult for the foreseeable future, particularly in her industry, especially as larger companies in other industries offer more and more to potential workers.""With the economy booming the way it was in various specific sectors, people were able to find better jobs,"" she said.

2022-03-04,"Nonfarm payrolls rose by 678,000 in February and the unemployment rate fell to 3.8%.Wall Street had been looking for respective figures of 440,000 and 3.9%.Wages were little changed on the month and up 5.1% for the year, well below expectations.Leisure and hospitality led job gains, followed by professional and business services and health care. Job growth accelerated in February, posting the biggest monthly gain since July as the employment picture got closer to its pre-pandemic self.Nonfarm payrolls for the month grew by 678,000 and the unemployment rate was 3.8%, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.That compared with estimates of 440,000 for payrolls and 3.9% for the jobless rate.In a sign that inflation could be cooling, wages barely rose for the month, up just 1 cent an hour, or 0.03%, compared with estimates for a 0.5% gain. The year-over-year increase was 5.13%, well below the 5.8% Dow Jones estimate as more lower-wage workers were hired and 12-month comparisons helped mute more recent gains.For the labor market broadly, the report brought the level of employed Americans closer to levels before the Covid crisis, though still short by 1.14 million. Labor shortages remain a major obstacle to fill the 10.9 million jobs that were open at the end of 2021, a historically high gap that had left about 1.7 vacancies per available worker.At least from an employment perspective, the February report confirms that the rampant omicron spread during the winter had little impact.""This report indicates that the job market is healthy and resilient to the ebbs and flows of the pandemic,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist for job placement site Glassdoor. ""We've seen that job gains have been over 400,000 for 10 months in a row.""""The labor market recovery remains very robust across the board as more Americans are returning to work,"" added Eric Merlis, managing director of global markets at Citizens Financial Group. ""Geopolitical issues and inflation pose ongoing threats to the U.S. economic recovery, but pandemic restrictions are being lifted and we continue to see strong job growth.""Markets, however, reacted little to the news as investors remain focused on the Russia-Ukraine war. Stocks fell through the day Friday and government bond yields were sharply lower.As has been the case for much of the pandemic era, leisure and hospitality led job gains, adding 179,000 for the month. The job gap for that sector, which was hit most by government-imposed restrictions, is 1.5 million from pre-Covid levels.The unemployment rate for the industry tumbled to 6.6%, a slide of 1.6 percentage points from January and closer to the 5.7% of February 2020. Wages actually declined slightly, falling 2 cents an hour to $19.35. The increase in hiring for bars, restaurants, hotels and other similar businesses likely is contributing to the slower pace of pay increases.""We're getting back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of labor force participation. Job growth is still quite healthy and strong. So things are really good,"" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. ""As more people come back to work and participation picks up, the level of wage gains should start to subside a little bit. In terms of the Fed worrying about inflation driven by people making more money, I guess that's good news.""Other sectors showing strong gains included professional and business services (95,000), Health care (64,000), construction (60,000), transportation and warehousing (48,000) and retail (37,000). Manufacturing contributed 36,000 and financial activities rose 35,000. Previous months saw upward revisions. December moved up to 588,000, an increase of 78,000 from the previous estimate, while January's rose to 481,000. Together, the revisions added 92,000 more than previously recorded and brought the three-month average to 582,000.The labor force participation rate, a closely watched metric indicating worker engagement, rose to 62.3%, still 1.1 percentage points from the February 2020 pre-pandemic level. An alternative measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons, and is sometimes referred to as the ""real"" unemployment rate, also edged higher, to 7.2%.The trend for jobs is clearly upward after a wintertime surge of Covid omicron cases, while exacting a large human toll, left little imprint on employment.""If we see more numbers like this moving forward, we can be optimistic about this year,"" wrote Nick Bunker, economic research director at job search site Indeed. ""Employment is growing at a strong rate and joblessness is getting closer and closer to pre-pandemic levels. Still, in these uncertain times, we cannot take anything for granted. But if the recovery can keep up its current tempo, several key indicators of labor market health will hit pre-pandemic levels this summer.""The economy also has been wrestling with pernicious inflation pressures running at their highest levels since the early 1980s stagflation days. The Labor Department's main inflation gauge showed consumer prices rising at a 7.5% clip in January, a number that is expected to climb to close to 8% when February's report is released next week.Amid it all, companies continue to hire, filling broad gaps still left in the leisure and hospitality sector as well as multiple other pandemic-struck industries.The Federal Reserve is watching the jobs numbers closely. Monetary policymakers widely view the economy as near full employment, adding pressure to prices that have soared amid supply shortages and demand surges related to the pandemic.Inflation has come as Congress has pumped more than $5 trillion in stimulus into the economy while the Fed has kept benchmark borrowing rates anchored near zero and injected nearly $5 trillion into the economy through asset purchases.Now, Fed officials expect this month to start raising interest rates, with market expectations that those hikes likely will continue through the year.The February jobs report ""will give the Fed greater confidence to push ahead with its planned policy tightening but, with wage growth now levelling off, there is arguably less pressure for officials to front-load an aggressive series of rate hikes over the coming months,"" wrote Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.Traders continued to fully price in a 25 basis point rate hike at the March Fed meeting, and see a strong possibility of five more such increases through the end of the year, according to CME Group data."
2022-03-04,"Workers saw average pay grow by 5.1% in the past year, to $31.58 an hour, according to the February jobs report issued Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor. Rank-and-file workers saw a 6.7% bump.However,  hourly earnings grew by just $0.01 from January, much less than the big increases in recent months.The slowdown suggests employers are having an easier time hiring and don't need to raise wages as much to compete. The big raises that many Americans got over the past year are starting to get smaller.Workers in the private sector saw average wages grow by 5.1% in the past year, to $31.58 an hour, according to the February jobs report issued Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor. Rank-and-file workers saw a higher bump, of 6.7%, to $26.94 an hour in February.Employers have paid bigger paychecks to compete for workers in a competitive hiring market.  While February's annual wage growth is high by historical standards, there are signs that it's tempering. Hourly earnings for all workers rose by just 1 cent (or, by 0.03%) last month relative to January, a weak gain relative to prior months.""What we're seeing is the sign that, in aggregate, wage growth is slowing down a little bit,"" said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab.  For context, workers had gotten roughly 3.5% annual raises prepandemic, which at the time was considered robust, Bunker said.""Even if wages don't continue to accelerate, but they're 4% or 5%, that's still quite strong,"" he said. But it wouldn't be the same ""gangbusters"" growth from early 2021, he said. Workers enjoyed greater bargaining power as the U.S. economy started emerging from its pandemic hibernation.Employers' demand for workers rose at the same time that Covid-related factors (like health fears, child care duties, early retirements and a bigger cash buffer) were limiting their supply.  Job openings surged to record levels. Businesses raised pay to attract scarce talent. Workers started quitting their jobs at record levels, many enticed by higher pay elsewhere, part of a trend dubbed the ""Great Resignation.""More from Personal Finance:When buy now, pay later comes back to bite youHow to tackle medical debt before it's a long-lasting problemHow the Ukraine-Russia conflict may push up prices for AmericansHowever, workers are reentering the labor force, increasing their availability and making it easier for employers to hire. Wages, in turn, may come down, and workers may lose some of their bargaining power.The labor force grew by 304,000 people in February, according to the Labor Department. (It remains 592,000 people shy of its February 2020 level.) The U.S. economy added 678,000 new jobs in February, the most since July and a continuation of recent strong growth.  Better pay is attracting workers off the sidelines, Bunker said. Jobs, especially in-person ones, may also be more palatable as risks posed by the Covid omicron virus variant recede. Despite higher pay, average wages haven't kept pace with inflation. Consumer prices rose by 7.5% in January relative to a year earlier, a 40-year high. Annual inflation outstripped February's 5.1% average pay increase.When a household's wages rise at a slower pace than inflation, it means they have less purchasing power. Their paychecks don't go as far at the grocery store and at the gas pump, for example.  ""Will inflation similarly slow down, and will it slow at the same pace or more?"" Bunker asked of consumer prices relative to average wage growth.The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates this month to cool down the economy and reduce inflation.Workers' raises have been much stronger than average in certain sectors of the economy, especially lower-paying, in-person jobs. In some cases, they've far surpassed the rate of inflation. For example, rank-and-file workers in leisure and hospitality jobs (such as bars, restaurants and hotels) have seen pay increase over 14% in the past year, to $17.22 an hour. (That equates to about $36,000 a year before tax.)Their pay growth is slowing down, too, when looking over shorter periods of time. Low-wage workers saw earnings increase by an average 7.6% in the three months through January, relative to 11.4% in the three months through August 2021, according to an Indeed analysis of federal data. (Low-wage industries include department stores, food services and drinking places, and child day care services.)Lower-income households have also felt inflation more acutely than higher-income ones, because more of their household budgets are earmarked for energy and transportation, which are among the categories that have seen prices rise fastest."

Since then, major ratings agencies Fitch, Moody's and S&P have slashed the country's sovereign rating to ""junk"" status, saying Western sanctions could undermine Russia's ability to service its debt.China has said it won't participate in those sanctions against Russia.Meanwhile, major global index providers MSCI and FTSE Russell announced last week that Russian stocks will be pulled from all their indexes. MSCI also announced that it will be reclassifying its MSCI Russia indexes to ""standalone markets"" rather than emerging markets.London-listed Russian stocks collapsed last week, before the London stock exchange suspended trading in 27 Russian securities. Still, nearly all their value was already wiped out by the time the suspension was announced Thursday. Oil prices surged Monday morning in Asia after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington and its allies are considering banning Russian oil and natural gas imports.U.S. crude soared nearly 9% higher to above $130 per barrel at one point, while Brent had jumped as much as 9% to about $128 per barrel. Both hit highs not seen since 2008. U.S. crude was recently trading 7.49% higher at $124.35, while Brent spiked 8.85% to $128.56. After the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer. It's also the largest exporter of crude oil to global markets.Roach told CNBC that higher oil prices are ""definitely stagflationary.""Stagflation is when the economy is simultaneously experiencing stagnant activity and accelerating inflation. The phenomenon was first recognized in the 1970s when an oil shock prompted an extended period of higher prices but sharply falling GDP growth.""It certainly does put pressure on central banks around the world … and raises the prospects of significantly higher interest rates as a result, but it remains to be seen if this trend is going to continue for many years as the stagflation of the late 70s and early 80s did,"" Roach said."
2022-03-07,"A top economic advisor to Ukraine's president told CNBC on Monday he believes Western nations must stop importing Russian oil and gas.Those transactions are ""bloody money"" that Moscow is using to help finance its invasion of Ukraine, said Oleg Ustenko. Oleg Ustenko, a top economic advisor to Ukraine's president, told CNBC on Monday he believes Western nations must stop importing Russian oil and gas, saying those transactions are ""bloody money"" that help Moscow finance its invasion of Ukraine.""It's just incredible because whoever is buying this oil and gas, they are responsible also for financing these aggressive"" actions by Russia's military, Ustenko said in an interview with CNBC's Steve Liesman that aired Monday on ""Closing Bell.""Russia's invasion of Ukraine — now in its second week — is leading to ""terrible, Dark Ages things in my country,"" Ustenko said. ""So for us, it's extremely important to cut off them from these bloody money receipts. And we do believe that by doing this we will be able really to hit Russians very hard. ... If this embargo is implemented, then we could be very much sure that they do not have economic power.""Ustenko's comments come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also has called for a more expansive response to the Russian invasion. Ustenko has been an advisor to Zelenskyy since May 2019, according to the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council.In his interview with CNBC, Ustenko painted a challenging humanitarian and economic picture. While he said the Ukrainian government has continued its social obligations, like paying the salaries of teachers, Ustenko said preliminary estimates suggest the country has suffered damages of roughly $100 billion. Agriculture plays an important role in Ukraine's economy, which had a gross domestic product of $200 billion in 2021, its highest level in decades. It's a pivotal time in the year for Ukrainian farmers, Ustenko said, explaining that normally this is when they begin spring fieldwork for key crops. That work is typically finalized in April, he said.""So, basically it's a very, very short period of time when they're able to do that kind of work. And if they're not able to do that it's going to be a significant, even further decline in our economy,"" Ustenko said. Ukraine is a major producer and exporter of wheat, corn and sunflower oil. Nearly half of the international sunflower oil market is supplied by Ukrainian producers, according to Ustenko. In some areas, he said over 70% of Ukraine's agricultural production is exported to global markets. He said Ukraine fortunately has enough wheat and grain in its own reserves to ""feed our population"" for the next year.If need be, he said, ""we will just stop exporting from the country."""

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Monday said the state is considering action against dozens of Russian-linked Lukoil gas stations as he aims to sever financial ties with the nation in response to its invasion of Ukraine.""We're trying to figure out what to do with them,"" Murphy said of the gas stations on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""The Democratic governor last week signed a proclamation directing state agencies to review their authority to suspend licenses of Russia-owned businesses, or of firms that directly invest in Russian or Belarusian enterprises.There are about 33 Lukoil gas stations in New Jersey, Murphy said. He noted, however, that ""they happen to be franchised by local New Jersey interests in most cases.""But ""you know what, not in New Jersey,"" Murphy said. ""We're going to have to figure that out.""Lukoil, one of Russia's largest energy producers, has more than 200 gas stations in the U.S. As Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to wage war in Ukraine, some Americans have called for a boycott of the stations as part of a broad push to punish Moscow's economy.But as Murphy acknowledged, the Lukoil gas stations in New Jersey and other states are franchised and operated by local residents.The governor's hedge on Lukoil comes days after the Newark city council unanimously voted to push to suspend the licenses of the two Lukoil stations in New Jersey's largest city.Advocates for Jersey's gas stations have decried the actions, saying they only serve to hurt American small business owners.Lukoil in a statement last week called for ""the immediate cessation"" of Russia's war in Ukraine. President Joe Biden, who has backed crippling sanctions on Russia's economy and its ultra-rich oligarchs, faces mounting pressure to halt U.S. purchases of Russian oil. Crude oil prices, meanwhile, are spiking on the volatility.Murphy, meanwhile, has vowed to take further steps to distance his state's business from Russia.""We're checking to see whether or not we have any investments at all in our pension funds.

2022-03-08,"Shares of certain U.S. companies that generate large portions of their revenue in Europe could be at risk as the region falls into a possible recession stemming from the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war, according Morgan Stanley."
2022-03-08,"Companies across all major sectors of the global economy have pulled out of Russia at unprecedented speed after its invasion of Ukraine.The exits may be most significant for oil and gas companies including BP and Exxon Mobil, which had multi-billion dollar oil and gas projects underway, whereas retailers, payment companies and entertainment brands like Disney could return more easily and suffer less in the short-term given limited revenue exposure.Reputation management and ESG concerns are factors, but there is the potential for a much broader period of de-globalization in business relationships and economies, especially as Russia's territorial ambitions stoke fears about China and Taiwan. As corporations across all sectors of the economy exit Russia with unprecedented speed, one of the questions being weighed is where this response to an act of unprovoked war fits on the spectrum of leadership decision-making.Is it a short-term pause; a demonstration of the greater, maybe lasting, influence of ESG in the C-suite; or a significant reshaping of corporate strategy and the economy around the theme of de-globalization?For experts in international business and management, the current events appear as if they may go well beyond reputation management and to a fundamental shift from the post-World War II period of increasingly global markets and efforts to achieve global scale, which were still firmly in place only about a week ago.""The world has changed and the C-suite really started taking seriously the parts of the world we don't want to go to,"" said Witold Henisz, professor of management at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. ""In 48 hours companies were pulling out and rethinking the post-war world. This is a fundamental break. It isn't a proxy war or limited incursion. This is not something that has happened since 1940.""One thing is clear: the ""old-school"" political risk of conventional international warfare is back, say Stanislav Markus, an international business professor at the Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina, and associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University. For many decades, large-scale violence had been geographically restricted — for example, to pockets of terrorist activity, civil wars, or drug cartels, and in failed states such as Afghanistan or specific regions of major economies, such as Mexico. It is too soon to conclude a broader de-globalization trend is accelerating, according to Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, but he says for experts already studying globalization data for signs of a reversal, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is potentially significant. From 2010 to 2015, globalization continued to increase, but the rate slowed between 2015-2019. Covid caused the rate of globalization to go backward in 2020, and the question now is: by 2025, will that abrupt reversal in globalization become persistent? ""We may be at a turning point here because of the strong forces against the standard economic forces that drove globalization. There is no quick reversal of this,"" Hufbauer said of Russia's invasion.  Some globalization experts remain cautious about a rush to judgment on the impact of Russia, while noting the rate of globalization has slowed. ""The halt in the period of rapid globalization actually goes back further than Trump & the pandemic (important as those have been). It started with the global financial crisis,"" said Jeffrey Frankel, a leading expert on globalization at Harvard University and former White House Council of Economic Advisers member.He cites one important statistic: For some decades, prior to 2008 the ratio of trade/GDP had been rising steadily (trade had been growing twice as fast as GDP). Since 2008-09, the ratio has been pretty flat.""My best judgement is that the major events with respect to Russia will not further set back globalization. Obviously Russia itself will become substantially cut off; but Russia is a very small share of the global economy,"" Frankel said. Hufbauer thinks the emphasis on corporate social responsibility has played a role in the swift response and we have seen companies exit markets in the past, such as Cuba and Iran. ""But this is unprecedented,"" he said. ""Big companies in droves. My thinking is that we've had this period of emphasis on corporate social responsibility and many CEOs and directors nominally saying they are all for it. With the 'woke language' of the moment they would be hard pressed by the background and their statements and the atmosphere not to be out in front of it,"" he said.  For some companies it will be easier to resume business in Russia than others, and at less overall cost. A company like Disney pulling a film release is not in a position similar to BP or ExxonMobil walking away from multi-billion-dollar oil and gas projects, though working in the country has proven difficult for energy firms from well before this crisis. Shell learned just how quickly its reputation would become a headline issue during this conflict for purchasing Russian oil, even though it too had previously announced an exit from Russian business ventures with state-owned Gazprom. On Tuesday, Shell said it will be withdrawing from all Russia oil and gas operations.""If you have to pull out under such pressure, you might as well look courageous. No one wants to be the last one still in,"" said Henisz, who studies corporate ESG. ""What's happening is coming up in ESG conversations,"" he said, but he stressed that he doesn't believe ESG is the primary driver for the corporate decisions. ""The pullouts are not happening because of those conversations. It's because Russia launched a land war in Europe,"" Henisz said.Brands from Apple to many of its Silicon Valley rivals and fashion luxury houses may not have too much to lose in the short-term from suspending operations, even though Russia is still a reasonable size consumer market with 144 million people. McDonald's and PepsiCo, which have among the largest revenue exposure to Russia, according to FactSet, among S&P 500 companies, had been slower to make a decision. But on Tuesday, McDonald's — which stated in a regulatory filing it has 9% revenue exposure to Russia and Ukraine — said it will temporarily suspend business at all of its Russia locations, 850 restaurants, and then later in the day, Starbucks, PepsiCo, as well as Coca-Cola, announced their own business halts in Russia.Between the sanctions, inflation in Russia and the rouble crash, it was not a hard call for many consumer brands that were first to pull out of the market. ""The reputation risk gets exponential as you wait,"" said Scheherezade Rehman, a professor of international finance at George Washington University who has advised the U.S. State Department, The World Bank and IMF. And especially for companies without a significant physical real estate footprint and few workers of their own in the country to support, the business isn't worth the risk or current operational headaches. ""Having an export market overseas at some point means taking local currency and exchanging it into dollars or euros. You don't want to be stuck in roubles. That's not a good business,"" she said. Among the biggest implications of de-globalization is a financial system that could fragment to a much greater extent on a geopolitical basis. Mastercard and Visa pulling out of Russia over the weekend, and PayPal suspending operations in Russia, are part of the response from the corporate world after the unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia kneecapped the eleventh-largest global economy in a matter of days.Rehman says while retail brands without their own extensive physical real estate footprints can easily move back into Russia, and there are workarounds within Russia for businesses – email, fax, Telex, she thinks many may choose to stay away given complexities under current conditions and that will have a lasting impact. ""You can still make payments, but who wants to do business like that? It will erode,"" Rehman says.While companies won't state their decisions in these terms, even large ones may choose to stay away because the unprecedented sanctions are not worth attempting to fully understand given the risks of ending up on the wrong side of the U.S. government.This never before seen type of ""financial nuclear warfare,"" as Rehman calls it – a coordinated block of a nation on such a scale and so fast-moving, including its central bank, has implications that are large and likely to grow over the longer-term. Cryptocurrencies and fintechs will factor into the future, but there are even bigger changes likely for the core ""plumbing"" of the global transactions system. With SWIFT now politicized and alternative payments systems already developed in countries including China, Russia and India – as well as in the EU, which didn't want to be as reliant on SWIFT, which is 80% U.S. dollar dominated – experts says the financial geopolitics will expand beyond this hybrid, kinetic war.""This sends a powerful signal to other regimes that may run afoul of the West, which controls the global financial infrastructure,"" says Markus. ""The signal is: create alternative infrastructure asap. We will see a fragmentation of payment networks, a proliferation of state-issued digital currencies, 'sovereign internet' (as Russia termed its largely failed effort), etc."" The global technology talent pool is also being shaken up. Over one million technology professionals work across Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, part of an Eastern European ""Silicon Valley"" that boomed in recent decades. Gartner, which says 43% of executives were worried about de-globalization even before Russia invaded Ukraine, stated in a recent report that the emerging issue of ""digital geopolitics"" is one of the most disruptive trends in the technology space.""The answer should not be a reactive onshoring of capabilities, especially in a world where the current crisis will increase existing shortages of digital skills,"" David Groombridge, Gartner Research VP told CNBC via email. ""Instead, executives need to navigate a complex balance of competitive advantage, geographic concentration risks, skills availability, legal and regulatory issues, and country risk factors to relocate their IT services."" If de-globalization is going to escalate, and China and India's positions on Russia's invasion remain nuanced, it didn't come out of nowhere. The battles in recent years between the U.S. and China over key technology and actions imposed on Huawei were warning shots in what may yet become a much larger divide.""The global geopolitical realignment, and the early signs of a China-Russia anti-Western partnership, imply that businesses may need to prepare for an emergence of Cold War blocks (amplified by infrastructural de-coupling). The challenge is how to span the blocks effectively and act as a bridge-builder in the eyes of the stakeholders,"" Markus said.This is the more significant issue than the multi-national corporate outlook in Russia. If boardrooms are now playing out a war scenario that snuck up on them, the strategies being devised for Russia are the first draft of a playbook for the far more bleak prospect of potential Chinese aggression against Taiwan. In recent days China has pushed back against any attempt to draw parallels between Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its ambitions, and has tried to walk a finer line in its stance on Russia than it did initially. In fact, some experts believe China may be the key, or even only hope, in deescalating the Russia-Ukraine situation.Russia can carve out its ""sphere of influence"" at the expense of Ukrainian sovereignty, and then it will remain a global pariah on par with Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, experts say. Executives would need to re-draw supply chains to avoid any reliance on Russia in the future, or turn back to playbooks from the past in which global businesses worked in other autocratic states without the rule of law. They make deep connections to state actors – as well as to societal stakeholders – because in such situations that is paramount since no independent courts can protect foreign investors, says Markus, who has studied these relationships.There are hopes that China will view the swift, unified response to Russia's invasion as a reason to move more slowly. But China's economy is much larger than Russia's and the corporate repercussions would be extreme if this scenario were to play out in relation to its territorial ambitions. ""Which explains the muted corporate response to human rights violations in Xinjiang or Hong Kong,"" Markus said. ""However, ignoring a brutal violent war (if China repeats Russia's mistake) for corporations would mean losing their credibility with a broad range of stakeholders. Clearly, advance discussions of such scenarios in the boardrooms are necessary.""""That's the bigger issue, people starting to think, what will we have to do about China, in 5 years, 10 years? People are starting to have a conversation they never had before,"" Henisz says. ""One of the most important conversations going on in board meetings in 2022 will be, what would happen if we have to pull out of China?"""
2022-03-08,"As Sri Lanka battles one of its worst economic crises in over 70 years, its central bank governor expressed optimism the country would be able to pull through, but stressed the importance of measures that ""may be not very palatable.""Cabraal said the central bank has proposed a package of measures to the Sri Lankan government to help alleviate shortages and curb inflation.He also urged the government to raise the duty levels of non-essential items that ""we can do without in this time of challenge"" to reduce the overall import demand. As Sri Lanka battles one of its worst economic crises in over 70 years, its central bank governor expressed optimism the country would be able to pull through, but stressed the importance of measures that ""may be not very palatable.""""We have the confidence to say that Sri Lanka would go through these times for a short period … We should be able to get out of this situation sooner than later,"" Ajith Nivard Cabraal said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday.In September, the country declared an economic emergency to control food supply and contain soaring inflation after a steep devaluation of its currency. Sri Lanka has been facing widespread and severe shortages of food and other essentials. It has also run out of cash to import fuel, leading to long queues outside petrol stations.Cabraal acknowledged these and other challenges Sri Lanka is facing, such as rising geopolitical tensions and a tourism sector hit hard by the Covid pandemic. He said the central bank wants to ""take certain key steps in order to deal with this situation, some may be not very palatable, as far as the general population is concerned. However, for the greater good of the economy, those will need to be done."" To address the country's acute fuel shortages, Cabraal said the central bank has made a ""very clear appeal"" to the Sri Lankan government to make a ""sharp increase"" in fuel and electricity prices, so there would be a ""natural reduction"" in demand. He also urged the government to raise the duty levels on non-essential items that ""we can do without in this time of challenge"" to reduce the overall import demand. ""We would expect the government to take those steps, and if those are taken, the incremental reductions in demand of fuel as well as non-essential items would help us to manage this period in a reasonably satisfactory manner,"" he said. Cabraal brushed aside concerns when asked about how feasible it would be to pass on costs to end consumers in a time when shopping malls in Colombo have been forced to turn off power to conserve energy, cars are stranded on roads due to a lack of fuel and nationwide 7½-hour daily power cuts are in place.He said fuel has already been priced ""very, very low,"" and that the crisis would propel the government to finally fast-track its renewable energy plans. Sri Lanka has also been facing a severe debt crisis. Since 2007, successive governments have issued sovereign bonds to Sri Lanka, with China being a major lender.While the country has foreign debt obligations of around $7 billion in 2022, including repayment of bonds worth $1 billion in July, Cabraal said he is confident the country would be able to make all payments without any default.On Monday, he reiterated a statement he made in January that the South Asian nation doesn't need an economic lifeline from the International Monetary Fund to aid its ailing economy. Instead, Cabraal said the reforms package the central bank proposed to the Sri Lanka government last Friday would bring ""discipline to the entire economy."" He added the central bank had asked for certain non-vital projects to be postponed, measures to keep inflation pressures in check and increased energy conservation measures, among other things. ""If those could be done, we would not necessarily need an outside program. This is a homegrown program which reflects the view of many international watchers as well. And it's important for the government to recognize that,"" Cabraal said.""If they do that, I believe we will be well on the path to recovery. And this situation that we are encountering now would be a thing of the past sooner than we think,"" he said."
2022-03-09,"For China, the speed and severity with which the U.S. and its allies sanctioned Russia is a warning sign that could guide future economic and foreign policy.""This is a very multilateral moment,"" said Reva Goujon, senior manager for the China corporate advisory team at Rhodium Group.Beijing has refused to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an invasion. China has focused on promoting negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and it opposes the economic measures that have been taken against Russia. BEIJING — Since taking office last year, President Joe Biden has pursued a strategy of restoring relationships with allies to put pressure on Beijing.The Russian invasion of Ukraine nearly two weeks ago showed what those allies can do.For China, the speed and severity with which the U.S. and its allies sanctioned Russia is a warning sign that could guide future economic and foreign policy.Chinese officials have increased efforts to buttress their country's self-reliance since President Donald Trump sanctioned telecommunications giant Huawei and slapped tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods.But Trump did all that singlehandedly — while simultaneously damaging ties with Europe and provoking uncertainty among U.S. allies in Asia.The response to Ukraine has been anything but a go-it-alone move by the United States.""Given the success that the U.S. has had in coordinating the financial sanctions and export controls not just with Europe but also with Japan, a key player in tech value chains — this is extremely alarming for China,"" said Reva Goujon, senior manager for the China corporate advisory team at Rhodium Group. ""This is a very multilateral moment,"" Goujon said. ""At a high level, you would think China would benefit from [the U.S.] having a big distraction in Europe, but actually [this] only accentuates those policy debates over critical exposure and vulnerabilities to Chinese supply chains.""From Germany to Japan, many countries have joined the U.S. in freezing the assets of Russian oligarchs, restricting access of Russia's biggest banks to the global financial system, and cutting off Russia from critical technology. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the friendship between China and Russia is ""rock solid.""He pointed specifically to a joint statement between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, in which China and Russia described ""international relations entering a new era"" and ""no limits"" to their countries' cooperation.Beijing has refused to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an invasion. China has focused on promoting negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and it opposes the economic measures that have been taken against Russia. China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said it ""opposes all illegal unilateral sanctions."" It has not elaborated on how the sanctions against Russia, which have been imposed by many countries, could be considered unilateral.When asked about an ""alliance of Western nations"" pushing Russia out of the SWIFT banking network, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said last week that ""China does not agree with resolving issues with sanctions, still less unilateral sanctions that lack the basis of international law,"" according to an English-language press conference transcript.Later in the week, spokesperson Wang reiterated that position in response to a question about whether Western sanctions on trade with Russia would affect China.Sanctions ""only create serious difficulties to the economy and livelihood of relevant countries and further intensify division and confrontation,"" he said. Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China in the last few years had already accelerated Beijing's efforts to firm up ties with Europe. The Ukraine war threatens all that.China's ""balancing act"" of trying to quietly support Russia while keeping up relations with Europe is ""going to be more and more difficult. That has consequences for trade links, primarily with the EU,"" said Nick Marro, global trade leader at The Economist Intelligence Unit. Marro noted that reputational risks rise for China ""the more China tries to fudge its stance on Russia and focus its criticism on NATO and the U.S.""""China was hoping to use the EU as a way to offset the pressure it was facing from the U.S.,"" Marro said. ""Right now, Europe sees Russia as an existential threat.""""Right now the impact for China [from the sanctions] really is secondary,"" Marro said. ""This conflict raises bigger questions around industrial policy and China's diplomatic relations with the West."" China is dealing with a host of its own economic challenges, from sluggish consumer demand to a slowdown in its massive property sector. Politically, Beijing is concerned with stability this year as leaders are set to meet in the fall to give Xi an unprecedented third term.That all said, China is more entrenched in the global economy than Russia is and doesn't have the same vulnerabilities — to sanctions, for example — that Russia has.Europe relies on Russian oil and natural gas, but Russia is otherwise small in global terms, with an economy the size of the U.S. state of Texas.

""Now that China is remaining relatively neutral, that's probably the best that we can expect.""The Ukraine war and sanctions will likely lower global gross domestic product by only 0.2% this year, with a bigger impact in Europe, according to Tommy Wu, a lead economist at Oxford Economics. Global finance provides a clear example of the limits on China's ability to support Russia. Just days after the war began, the U.S. and EU pledged to remove some Russian banks from SWIFT, the standard interbank messaging system for financial institutions.""If all Russian institutions are banned from joining the SWIFT network, then I think the level of political pressure is very different from what it is now,"" said ­­Zhu Ning, professor of finance and deputy dean at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance.""Then any attempt to avoid punishment"" would be considered ""complicit,"" he said. ""Quite tricky for Chinese financial institutions.""The Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank announced last week it was suspending activities related to Russia and Belarus. On the other hand, there's also the matter of general political dysfunction in the United States, where the Democrat and Republican parties are increasingly unable to work together to achieve even widely supported domestic goals.Rhodium Group's Goujon pointed out that the U.S. presidential election in 2024 poses a risk to how long the unity lasts among U.S. allies.""I think the West is very caught up in the moment, ... this idea that the U.S.-led liberal order is back, Germany has woken up, even Switzerland,"" she said.""But there are other countries like Mexico, like India, that we see embrace the Chinese narrative of the multipolar order more readily,"" she said, ""and that's where I think China is waiting for the heat of the war to die."" Regardless, the Biden administration is trying hard to unify the world's democracies — and since the Ukraine war started, more of them seem to be listening.Last week, the leaders of the Quad — Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. — held a call about the conflict and to reaffirm their commitment to work together as a group. However, India has yet to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Strengthening the Quad is part of Biden's strategy ""to restore American leadership in the Indo-Pacific,"" as announced in a fact sheet published in February. A U.S. official told reporters in a briefing last month there was no intention to engage Beijing on the economic aspects of building up the Indo-Pacific.  When asked Monday about Biden's Indo-Pacific strategy, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang claimed the U.S. goal is to create an Indo-Pacific version of NATO. ""China wants all parties to join us in doing the right thing,"" he said, via an official translator. ""Together we will reject attempts to create small, divisive circles within the Pacific.""Wang said during the annual press briefing that China opposes bloc politics. He portrayed Beijing's ties with Europe, India, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa and other countries and regions as separate from China's other foreign relations."
2022-03-09,"The Bank of Japan now has a window of opportunity to get interest rates ""a little bit back closer to normal,"" said Izumi Devalier of BofA Global Research.In the near term, Japan's central bank could make a one-off policy adjustment to increase interest rates and to give a ""little bit more flexibility"" for long-term yields to trade, said the BofA chief Japan economist.But BofA expects the BOJ to end its negative interest rate policy at its October meeting and move the ceiling on its 10-year yield target to 0.5% from the current 0.25%. The Bank of Japan now has a window of opportunity to get interest rates ""a little bit back closer to normal,"" said Izumi Devalier of BofA Global Research.In the near term, Japan's central bank could make a one-off policy adjustment to increase interest rates and to give a ""little bit more flexibility"" for long-term yields to trade, said the BofA chief Japan economist.Japan adopted negative interest rates in 2016 in an effort to combat decades of deflation by encouraging borrowing and spending. But the BOJ has struggled for years to meet its elusive inflation target, preventing the central bank from raising rates back to normal levels.But BofA expects the BOJ to end its negative interest rate policy at its October meeting and move the ceiling on its 10-year yield target to 0.5% from the current 0.25%.""Near-term focus will be more on growth risks, and then if we do get a stabilization, I think we could get the move later in the year,"" Devalier added. Devalier explained that the fundamental reason behind the BOJ being able to take the next step toward normalization is because of the inflation situation in Japan.""Under Governor [Haruhiko] Kuroda, I do think the risks of disinflation or deflation have receded,"" she said. ""And now, firms may not be aggressively hiking prices, but they're less likely to be compelled to cut in the face of weak demand or an FX shock.""While many economies are struggling with surging inflation, consumer prices have been relatively stagnant in Japan for years. Lackluster inflation or deflation stifles wages and corporate investment, which in turn limits economic growth.Subsiding deflation risks are a ""paradigm shift"" for Japan, she said, adding the country is possibly heading towards a sustained inflation level of 1%.""The new government under [Prime Minister Fumio] Kishida is also less supportive of reflation, or especially aggressive BOJ easing at all costs,"" she said. ""However, the Bank of Japan is going to remain very cautious, especially with the developments around Ukraine, and the downside risks to the global economy from the development,"" Devalier said.The war in Ukraine has driven energy prices higher as the West punishes Russia — the world's third-largest oil producer — by targeting Russian banks and oil.With oil prices rising, she said this might mean ""upside risks to Japan's inflation outlook and downside risks to growth."" She noted Japan is a net energy importer with a majority of its crude oil from the Middle East and Russia.""A rise in energy prices, especially if it is driven by a supply side shock, which this is, is going to be a headwind for growth,"" Devalier said."
2022-03-09,"Putin's invasion of Ukraine has managed to unite and strengthen the international community with most of its members condemning Russia's actions.Russia has repeatedly sought to weaken and undermine Western democracies and relations in recent years.Global diplomatic circuits have been busy in recent months as officials largely feared Russia was gearing up for some kind of attack on Ukraine. If there's anything we've learned about President Vladimir Putin over the 22 years or so that he's been in power in Russia it's that he has systematically and repeatedly tried to weaken and undermine the West.But in his invasion of Ukraine he seems to have achieved exactly the opposite, managing to unite most of the international community in its condemnation of Russia's aggression toward its neighbor.""NATO is united — more so than at any point since the Soviet collapse — with a renewed sense of purpose and mission,"" Ian Bremmer, president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, commented this week.""So too is the European Union: Germany supports ending their economic dependence on Russia and is nearly doubling their defense spend; France is on board ... even Moscow-tilting Hungary has condemned the invasion, favored a crippling sanctions regime, and is allowing in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees,"" Bremmer said in emailed comments Monday.The West is used to Russia behaving like a ""malign actor"" on the global stage with its interference in democratic processes like its meddling in the 2016 U.S. election or support for far-right political groups in Europe, or the overseeing of state-sponsored cyberattacks and weaponizing energy supplies with recent gas price rises in Europe. It was also widely seen as responsible for a nerve agent attack on U.K. soil in 2018 and was subsequently sanctioned. Putin was then accused of ordering a nerve agent attack on his political nemesis and biggest critic, Alexei Navalny, in 2020. Russia denied involvement in both attacks despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. With this background of bad behavior and geopolitical meddling, Russia's invasion of Ukraine should come as no surprise, particularly given its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its overt attempts to politically influence other former Soviet neighbors, like Belarus and Georgia.Despite imposing sanctions on Russia for Crimea's annexation, the West was widely accused of not being tough enough on Moscow with analysts saying Putin learned from the Crimea experience that he could invade and annex part of a sovereign state and, essentially, get away with it.But now, with Russia's invasion of the north, south and east of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the West looks more united than it has been for many years. Recent divisions over, within and between NATO, the EU, the U.K. and other developed nations are seemingly dissipating overnight as nations unite to help Ukraine defeat Russia.Anton Barbashin, a political analyst and editorial director of the journal Riddle Russia, told CNBC that Putin's invasion has had a number of unintended consequences:""Whatever was Putin's end goal in Ukraine, it is already clear that what he has achieved is uniting the West, destroying Russia's economy, endangering the survival of the Russian state as we know it, almost guaranteed Ukraine's future inclusion into western institutions and ultimate demise of Russia's grand power aspirations. To call it a mistake is to say nothing,"" he told CNBC in emailed comments Wednesday. Global diplomatic circuits have been busy in recent months as officials largely feared Russia was gearing up for some kind of attack on Ukraine, although the full-scale invasion caught many analysts by surprise with most expecting a smaller-scale incursion into eastern Ukraine.Since the invasion, there has been a further flurry of high-profile and urgent meetings, visits and video calls between the leaders of NATO countries with previous disagreements between members of the alliance — on a range of matters from defense spending to refugees, Brexit and energy security — put on the backburner. Multiple public protests have been held across the world against Putin and his war in Ukraine while many iconic brands have pulled out of Russia, turning the country into a pariah on the global stage.""Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine is reshaping the politics of Europe and – possibly – beyond,"" Berenberg Bank's chief economist, Holger Schmieding, noted in his latest report assessing the macro impact of the conflict. ""The free world seems to be pulling together like rarely before,"" he added.Even before the war, Schmieding noted, Russia was starting to resemble some features ""of a Soviet style petro-economy with an oversized military sector and ultimately unaffordable imperial ambitions"" and seemed bound to slowly fall more and more behind the advanced world.Now, the costs of war, increasing domestic repression and duly harsh Western sanctions ""will likely hasten the economic demise of Putin's Russia much more so and much faster than the costly occupation of Afghanistan contributed to the erosion of Soviet power in the 1980s,"" Schmieding noted. While Putin is looking increasingly isolated, Western democracies are treading a tightrope of supporting Ukraine while trying not to be perceived to intervene militarily, a move that could easily spark a wider and more destructive global conflict with Russia.In his State of the Union address last week, President Joe Biden commented on the West's cohesion in the crisis, saying that ""we see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe, a more unified West"" adding that ""in the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment.""Democracies in the West might be rising to the moment but Russia's invasion has certainly posed a moral, military and geopolitical dilemma for the EU and NATO. Ukraine is not a member of either bloc but its position on the edge of Europe, acting as a buffer state between NATO members and Russia, puts it in an important strategic position. Ukraine's pro-Western and pro-democracy government and populace, and aspirations to join the EU and NATO, have also provoked widespread sympathy for Ukraine and its people. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled the war but many have stayed to fight, increasing global admiration for Ukraine.Ironically, Putin's invasion — largely predicated on the demand that Ukraine is never allowed to join NATO — has inadvertently boosted the case for joining the military alliance with public opinion in Finland and Sweden shifting in favor of joining the organization.NATO deployments in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states have already been bolstered with more troops and weaponry, again strengthening an alliance Putin wanted to see diminished. Russia's invasion has also prompted tardy defense spenders, namely Germany, to pledge a massive boost in defense spending and infrastructure and has hastened Europe's decoupling from Russia on the energy front, too, with the EU (which received 41% of its natural gas from Russia, and 27% of its crude oil, according to 2019 data) looking to diversify, and fast.That dependence on Russian energy (which the U.S. and several European countries like Ukraine and Poland warned about with the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline) has led to some signs of division in Europe over how far the bloc should go in restricting Russian energy supplies. But on Tuesday, the U.S. and U.K. said they were banning Russian oil imports, while the EU announced updated plans to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels.Asked whether he believed Russia expected a more disunited reaction from the West, political analyst Barbashin noted that the ""Kremlin has certainly anticipated a reaction, sanctions and strong condemnation but he [Putin] has miscalculated for Germany's ultimate change of policy towards Russia that granted a full European-Atlantic consolidation against Putin's war."" Less than two weeks into Russia's invasion, Ukraine's armed forces and volunteers continue to mount a brave resistance against Russian forces who have attacked cities in the north, east and south of the country.Many analysts and strategists believe it is only a matter of time before Ukraine is overwhelmed by Moscow's military might, however, and they have predicted the installation of a pro-Russian regime in Kyiv followed by a long and bloody insurgency as Ukrainians refuse to accept Russia's proxy rule.China, Russia's ally, is believed to be increasingly perturbed by the prospect of a long-term conflict. U.S. intelligence officials have suggested Beijing is not only unsettled by the war but its possible impact on the global economy and the fact that it is bringing the U.S. and Europe closer together. Giving evidence before Congress on Tuesday, the CIA's director, Bill Burns, said that China ""did not anticipate the significant difficulty that the Russians would run into and I think they're unsettled by the reputational damage that could come from their close association with President Putin,"" Burns said.China has refused to condemn Russia's invasion but analysts believe Chinese President Xi Jinping likely did not believe Putin would launch such a full-scale attack.

Russia's foreign minister on Thursday struck a defiant tone in the face of intensifying economic sanctions, saying that his country would recover from the crisis with a ""full bill of health"" and vowing never again to rely on Western partners.Sergey Lavrov told CNBC that Russia could handle its economy by itself as the pariah state becomes increasingly isolated by international powers seeking to stymie President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.""Regarding our economic problems, we'll sort them out,"" Lavrov told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Turkey following his talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Lavrov noted that Russia has at various other points handled periods of economic isolation and difficulty.The longtime Russian minister added that he was no longer under any illusion that the West could be trusted, accusing it of betrayal.""I assure you: We will come out of this crisis with a full bill of psychological health and a full bill of health regarding our awareness. We will not be under the slightest illusion that the West could be a reliable partner,"" Lavrov said via a translation.""We will do everything so as never, in any way, to be dependent on the West in those areas of our life which have a decisive significance for our people,"" he said. It is unclear how Russia seeks to independently operate its economy moving forward.The Russian economy has fallen to its knees in the two weeks since the start of the Ukraine war as Western allies have sought economic means of pressuring Putin to end the conflict.The Russian ruble continued to tumble lower this week, reaching fresh record lows amid further financial exclusions, while trading on the Moscow stock exchange remains largely suspended. The Western sanctions are intended to collapse Russia's economy, and many economists suggest that they're likely to work.The Kremlin on Thursday said the country's economy was in ""shock"" in the wake of ""unprecedented"" economic war.Meantime, the pressure on Putin's elite inner circle continues to heat up, with Britain on Thursday adding Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich and six others to a growing list of oligarchs facing asset seizures under U.K., EU and U.S. sanctions.Lavrov said Thursday that the ongoing sanctions fly in the face of apparent Western democratic values, citing it as another example of untrustworthiness.""Whoever heard of private property rights being trampled over by a simple clicking of the fingers? Whoever heard of the presumption of innocence, the pillar of the legal system in the West, is simply ignored and violated most gravely?,"" he said."
2022-03-10,"The consumer price index for February rose 7.9% from a year ago, the highest level since January 1982.Excluding food and energy, both of which moved sharply higher during the month, core inflation still rose 6.4%, in line with expectations but the highest since August 1982.Gas, groceries and shelter were the biggest contributors to the CPI gain. Auto prices eased.Worker paychecks fell further behind, as inflation-adjusted earnings dropped 0.8% in February, contributing to a 2.6% decline over the past year. Inflation grew worse in February amid the escalating crisis in Ukraine and price pressures that became more entrenched.The consumer price index, which measures a wide-ranging basket of goods and services, increased 7.9% over the past 12 months, a fresh 40-year high for the closely followed gauge, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.The February acceleration was the fastest pace since January1982, back when the U.S. economy confronted the twin threat of higher inflation and reduced economic growth.On a month-over-month basis, the CPI gain was 0.8%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected headline inflation to increase 7.8% for the year and 0.7% for the month.Food prices rose 1% and food at home jumped 1.4%, both the fastest monthly gains since April 2020, in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.Energy also was at the forefront of ballooning prices, up 3.5% for February and accounting for about one-third of the headline gain. Shelter costs, which account for about one-third of the CPI weighting, accelerated another 0.5%, for a 12-month rise of 4.7%, the fastest annual increase since May 1991. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation rose 6.4%, in line with estimates and the highest since August 1982. On a monthly basis, core CPI was up 0.5, also consistent with Wall Street expectations.The rise in inflation meant worker paychecks fell further behind despite what otherwise would be considered strong increases.Real inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings for the month fell 0.8% in February, contributing to a 2.6% decline over the past year, according to the BLS. That came even though headline earnings rose 5.1% from a year ago, but were outweighed by the price surge.Markets indicated a negative open on Wall Street, with stocks pressured by faltering Russia-Ukraine cease-fire talks.

""Inflation is coming in hot but the reality is there are no real surprises in this report,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy for E-Trade. ""The market likely already priced the inflation increase in accordingly, and is instead intently focused on Ukraine and the downstream impact from commodities, which are already sending shockwaves through the market.""The inflation surge is in keeping with price gains over the past year. Inflation has roared higher amid an unprecedented government spending blitz coupled with persistent supply chain disruptions that have been unable to keep up with stimulus-fueled demand, particularly for goods over services.Policymakers have been expecting inflation to abate as supply chain issues ease. The New York Fed's supply chain index shows pressure has eased in 2022, though it is still near historically high levels.Vehicle costs have been a powerful inflationary force but showed signs of easing in February. Used car and truck prices actually declined 0.2%, their first negative showing since September 2021, but are still up 41.2% over the past year. New car prices rose 0.3% for the month and 12.4% over the 12-month period.A raging crisis in Europe has only fed into the price pressures, as sanctions against Russia have coincided with surging gasoline costs. Prices at the pump are up about 24% over just the past month and 53% in the past year, according to AAA.Moreover, business are raising costs to keep up with the price of raw goods and increasing pay in a historically tight labor market in which there are about 4.8 million more job openings than there are available workers.Recent surveys, including one this week from the National Federation of Independent Business, show a record level of smaller companies are raising prices to cope with surging costs.To try to stem the trend, the Federal Reserve is expected next week to announce the first of a series of interest rate hikes aimed at slowing inflation. It will be the first time the central bank has raised rates in more than three years, and mark a reversal of a zero interest rate policy and unprecedented levels of cash injections for an economy that in 2021 grew at its fastest pace in 37 years.However, inflation is not a U.S.-centric story.Global prices are subject to many of the same factors hitting the domestic economy, and central banks are responding in kind. On Thursday, the European Central Bank said it was not moving its benchmark interest rate but would end its own asset purchase program sooner than planned.In other economic news, jobless claims for the week ended March 5 totaled 227,000, higher than the 216,000 estimate and up 11,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said. Continuing claims rose slightly to just below 1.5 million, though the four-week moving average remained at its lowest level since 1970."
2022-03-10,"Shelter, gasoline and food were the largest contributors to inflation in February, the U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday.These categories are also the biggest components of household budgets. They accounted for 63% of total expenses for the average household in 2020.Grocery bills and housing costs are rising at their fastest annual rate since April 1981 and May 1991, respectively. Energy costs (which include gasoline) are up the most since July 1981. Consumer prices are rising at their fastest pace in decades — and that inflation has been most acute in household staple items like food, housing and transportation, making it hard to escape the budgetary sting.The Consumer Price Index jumped 7.9% in February relative to a year earlier, the largest 12-month increase since January 1982, the U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday.The index measures price fluctuations across a broad basket of goods and services. A $100 basket a year ago would cost $107.90 today.Shelter, gasoline and food were the largest contributors to the increase in overall prices in February, the Labor Department said. (The price index jumped by 0.8% over the month.) These three categories were the three largest components of household budgets in 2020, respectively. Together, they accounted for 63% of total expenses, according to most recent Labor Department data.""There's nowhere to hide,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate. ""This is hitting everybody.""Inflation ""is most pronounced on items that are necessities,"" he added.(Gasoline is part of the broader ""transportation"" category, which also includes public transit costs and vehicle purchases. Car sales have also spiked over the last year.)More from Personal Finance:How to save money at the grocery store as food prices riseRetirees likely shielded from inflation hit on some expensesThe Great Resignation is still in full swingOf course, inflation doesn't impact all consumers equally. For example, a consumer who commutes by car and has to fill up a gas tank may feel higher prices more acutely than one who works from home or uses public transportation. And American workers have gotten big raises in the past year, reducing (though not always overriding) the sting of higher prices.The Federal Reserve is also expected to start raising interest rates next week in an attempt to tame inflation. Household grocery bills swelled by 8.6% in the last 12 months, the largest jump since April 1981, according to the Labor Department.Costs for all major food groups increased in February; dairy and fruits and vegetables saw prices rise at their fastest monthly pace in over a decade.Gasoline price are up 38% in the last year. That statistic doesn't include the recent run-up due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed prices at the pump to more than $4 a gallon, on average, on Sunday — the highest since 2008.Overall energy costs (which include items beyond gasoline) are up the most since July 1981, on an annual basis.  Shelter costs like rents are up 4.7% in the last year, the most since May 1991. While that percentage increase was smaller than in other categories, housing costs account for more than a third of the average household budget — giving it an outsized dollar impact.""That comparatively benign increase ... is likely to put the biggest squeeze on household budgets for the remainder of the year,"" McBride said.A 5% increase in a $1,000-a-month apartment lease amounts to much more money than a 20% rise in something that costs $5, for example ($50 a month versus $1, respectively). And a lease locks in that price over a fixed term. Elevated inflation began emerging in spring 2021 as the U.S. economy came out of its pandemic hibernation.Consumers had pent-up demand after staying home for months to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Households were flush with cash; they'd been unable to spend on things like entertainment and travel, and had savings from stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits the federal government issued to prop up the economy.High consumer demand stressed supply lines already beleaguered by virus-related disruptions. Higher prices followed, though were initially concentrated in just a few categories. Many economists and federal officials thought the phenomenon would be temporary. However, inflation has persisted. Consumers may see costs rise even faster in the next few months, according to financial experts.That's likely to be true of gasoline and other categories negatively affected by the war in Ukraine. Further, the supply-chain snarl ""may be worsened by prolonged economic consequences"" of the conflict, according to Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Philadelphia-based Glenmede Trust Company.He expects prices to rise at a more modest 4% to 5% annual rate by the end of 2022."
2022-03-11,"Supply-side risks arising from the war have stoked extreme volatility across global commodity markets, with oil, nickel and wheat also surging alongside natural gas in recent weeks.Natural gas is once again front and center after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak warned that Moscow could halt its exports to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. LONDON — Natural gas is one of several commodities caught in the crossfire of the conflict in Ukraine, and the European economy could take a hit if Russia halts its exports.Supply-side risks arising from the war have stoked extreme volatility across global commodity markets, with oil, nickel and wheat also surging alongside natural gas in recent weeks.Natural gas is once again front and center after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak warned that Moscow could halt its exports to Germany and the rest of Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.His comments came partially in response to Germany's decision last month to block the certification of the highly contentious Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, along with the barrage of economic sanctions that have been imposed by Western powers since, aimed at crippling the Russian economy.The U.S. announced earlier this week that it will ban all imports of Russian oil and gas, while the U.K. suggested it will phase out imports by the end of the year. The European Union has plans to cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds but its move isn't quite as severe, in large part because of its heavy reliance on Russian energy.The euro area generates around a quarter of its energy from natural gas, while Russia accounts for around one-third of the bloc's imports. Any further gas import disruptions could therefore have significant knock-on effects for euro zone economic output and inflation, according to Goldman Sachs. In a research note Monday, Goldman's Chief European Economist Sven Jari Stehn and his team set forth several scenarios and assessed how they might impact the European economy.These included one scenario in which there are no further supply disruptions beyond the flow reduction underway since last September, another in which gas imports through Ukraine cease for the remainder of the year, and a third in which all Russian pipeline imports to Europe are halted throughout 2022.""By mapping physical gas supply constraints and upwards price pressures into GVA (gross value added) effects in the Euro area and the U.K., we estimate that for 2022 as a whole high gas prices could weigh on Euro area GDP growth by 0.6pp (percentage points) and the U.K. by 0.1pp relative to our baseline forecast if we assume no further gas supply disruptions,"" Stehn said.The impact in Germany is likely to be even greater (-0.9pp), Stehn added, due to its high reliance on Russian gas.""The scenario in which Russia stops all pipeline exports could see Euro area GDP growth fall by 2.2pp in 2022 relative to our baseline forecast, with sizable impacts in Germany (-3.4pp) and Italy (-2.6pp).""On the inflation front, the scenario in which gas flows through Ukraine are halted would add 0.7 percentage points to Goldman Sachs' euro area inflation forecast at its peak in December 2022.""If gas prices rise further due to gas pipeline flows from Russia being shut down, our headline inflation forecast could be up to 1.3pp higher, with likely also significant pass-through into core prices,"" Stehn said.""In the U.K., we expect a range of 22% to 90% for the October price cap under the three scenarios, signaling two-sided risk around our current assumption of 55%.""The U.K.'s energy price cap will be reviewed by the country's regulator in October. From April 1 this year, the cap is set to rise by 54% from its previous level to £693 ($906) per year to account for soaring energy prices even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Goldman's baseline assumption is for another 55% rise to be announced in October, with a 90% increase possible in the event of a total import shutdown.The prospect of further spikes in energy prices have fueled fears of a ""stagflation"" period, in which the global economy is beset by high inflation alongside slow economic growth and high unemployment.Total cut-off unlikelyGiven Russia's reliance on exports to Europe and its ever-shrinking sources of revenue elsewhere in light of the suite of international sanctions, BCA Research strategists suggested in a note Wednesday that a complete stoppage was unlikely.""Although Moscow forged a new deal with Beijing last month to supply China's CNPC with an additional 10 billion cubic meters of gas a year, the new planned pipeline to carry these supplies will take two to three years to complete,"" said Mathieu Savary, chief European strategist at BCA Research. ""In the meantime, Russia will have to rely on its sales to Europe to fund its military incursion in Ukraine and ensure domestic stability.""Savary suggested, however, that Novak's threat still highlights the risk of disruption to European energy supplies, which will continue to exert upward pressure on natural gas prices in the near term.""Until the risk premium in oil and natgas prices dissipates, high energy costs will lead to a period of stagflation in the Eurozone,"" Savary added.""Investors should maintain a cautious stance towards European risk assets over the near-term."""
2022-03-11,"""On Ukraine, indeed the current situation there is grave, and China is deeply concerned and grieved,"" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters Friday.This year marks Li's final appearance at the press briefing as premier, a position he's held since 2013. Li closed the roughly two-hour-long session with a pledge that China would continue to open up its economy regardless of changes in the international environment.  BEIJING — China is ""deeply"" worried about the crisis in Ukraine, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday, warning that sanctions will hurt global growth.""On Ukraine, indeed the current situation there is grave, and China is deeply concerned and grieved,"" Li said in Mandarin, according to an official translation.The premier was responding to two questions about the Ukraine war at the beginning of an annual press briefing. Since Russia's attack on Ukraine about two weeks ago, Beijing has refused to call it an invasion and said China would maintain normal trade with both countries, without joining in on U.S., EU and other countries' sanctions on Russia.On Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said relations with Russia were ""rock solid."" He pointed to a joint statement with Russia issued after a high-level meeting in early February between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.During the Friday briefing, Li maintained that China has ""followed an independent policy of peace"" and repeated Beijing's line of encouraging Russia and Ukraine to negotiate. ""The pressing task now is preventing tensions from escalating or even getting out of control.""Li did not specifically say whether China would economically support Russia, but noted China supports ""all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis."" He added that the sanctions would only shock a world economy already struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.Over the weekend, the International Monetary Fund said the economic consequences of the war are ""already very serious"" with ""adverse"" shocks to inflation and business activity in many countries.Last week, Oxford Economics estimated the war would reduce global GDP by 0.2%, with a decline of 0.6% this year if the fighting persists through 2023. Li was speaking Friday at a press briefing held at the close of an annual parliamentary meeting.This year marks Li's final appearance at the briefing as premier, a position he's held since 2013. The ruling Chinese Communist Party is set in the fall to select a new leadership team, although President Xi Jinping is expected to stay on for an unprecedented third term.Li closed the roughly two-hour-long briefing with a pledge that China would continue to open up its economy regardless of changes in the international environment.

Rather, she says, she relied on her late husband Lloyd Bean to help take care of their two children, missing activities for work while scaling the career ladder. And she credits her career success to the strategy.""I would not be able to be CEO of the company unless I outsourced the caring for my kids,"" Burns, 63, tells CNBC Make It.

2022-03-14,"Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine and the global response to it will drastically alter Russia’s economic future, setting the country back 30 years, experts say.As the country’s economy collapses, the exodus of global brands will give rise to a profound shift in how middle-class citizens will make and spend their money.Experts say the coming period of Russian economic isolation could last at least five years, but more likely will be measured in decades. WASHINGTON — Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war on Ukraine and the resulting global response will set Russia's economy back by at least 30 years — close to old Soviet Union times — and lower its standard of living for at least the next five years, according to economists, investors and diplomats.The sweeping Western sanctions are designed to inflict maximum pain on the country's economy by expelling it from global markets and freezing assets around the world. From the moment they took effect three weeks ago, the sanctions have opened a new chapter in Russia's economic history.Its financial system and currency are collapsing on multiple fronts, forcing the Kremlin to close the stock market and artificially prop up the ruble inside its borders. Practically overnight, the country's 40-year effort to build a prosperous market-based economy that began under former leader Mikhail Gorbachev has failed — one more casualty in President Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine.Landmark economic and social reforms originating in the 1980s gave the Soviet Union its first taste of American products. But decades of work to integrate the economy into Europe ended in the past few weeks, as blue chip companies quit the Russian market and the United States and European Union moved to wind down trade and tourism with Russia. Two sanctions in particular have wreaked considerable havoc. The first one expelled Russia's largest banks from the global payments network known as SWIFT, making it very difficult for them to process overseas transactions.The second measure froze hundreds of billions of euros held in reserve by Russia's central bank. Without reserve funds to shore up the ruble, there is very little the Kremlin can do to prevent its value from collapsing. Meanwhile, the United States and Britain are also halting imports of Russian oil and gas, the U.S. has imposed export controls on high tech equipment and luxury goods, and a growing list of countries have barred Russian ships from their ports.""The problem you have now is we're basically in a spiral where we don't know how many unrealized losses there are left to realize,"" said Maximillian Hess, a Central Asia fellow in the Eurasia program at the nonprofit Foreign Policy Research Institute.""So we still can't rule out that the ruble could collapse, collapse,"" he stressed. Already, the snowballing economic crisis in Russia threatens to wipe out decades of economic gains made by ordinary citizens. In the past month, the ruble has lost 40% of its value against the dollar, rendering the currency effectively useless outside of Russia.Desperate to maintain the ruble's value inside the country, on March 8 the Kremlin issued a new order barring the exchange of rubles for hard currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro. This effectively turned the ruble into play money, a currency that only has value in an essentially fictional economy inside Russia, where people aren't allowed to buy the products to which they've become accustomed. Policies like these are erasing credibility built over decades of integrating the Russian economy into the rest of Europe.  What's more, sanctions on the largest banks have added yet another layer of uncertainty to everyday transactions, like buying a metro ticket in Moscow with Apple Pay, which is prohibited by U.S. sanctions, or exchanging rubles for dollars at a bank, which is prohibited by the Kremlin.""There was an emerging middle class [in Russia] that is now going to be knocked back,"" said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist and head of the Barings Investment Institute. ""It's going to be isolated. It's going to have a currency that doesn't really hold any value outside the country."" Foreign policy experts also believe that Russia will default on its sovereign debt when more than $100 million in bond payments come due on Wednesday. ""Russia is defaulting, that's guaranteed,"" said Hess.

""It's never again going to be able to borrow at the rates that it was able to borrow at in recent years."" Since the start of the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, more than 300 of the world's most iconic brands have voluntarily halted or dialed back their business.Among them are global banks like Goldman Sachs, all Big Four accounting firms and consumer brands like Starbucks and Ford.""A lot of these companies pulling out of Russia are not doing it for their reputational reasons,"" said Hess. ""It's because they know they're not going to be able to process payments and move money in and out of the country for the foreseeable future,"" due to the sanctions, he said. Several departures are likely to hit Russians harder than others.For decades, PepsiCo, Levi Strauss and Coca-Cola symbolized freedom for young people behind the Iron Curtain. All three have announced they will suspend sales of their core products.Another high impact exit is the three oil giants: Shell, BP and Exxon, whose departures dealt a body blow to the petroleum-dependent economy. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and American Express also suspended services, leaving Russians outside the country unable to use their debit cards and Russian banks scrambling to shift to a Chinese card issuers.One of the most symbolic departures was that of McDonald's. The fast food chain opened its first restaurant in Moscow in early 1990, an event that was considered a watershed moment in Russia's opening to the West. Last week, McDonald's announced that all 850 of its restaurants in Russia would temporarily close. Several of the companies that have halted operations in Russia insist they'll be back as soon as the fighting in Ukraine is over. But global investment experts say U.S. sanctions and a depreciating ruble make it difficult to envision any of these companies returning this year, or the next.""Not next year, not five years from now. It's going to be a long time before investors go back to Russia,"" said Smart of Barings. Unlike their neighbors in Ukraine, who have been living under missile bombardment, average Russians aren't fleeing for their lives. They're not even feeling the full effect of the NATO sanctions yet.""Very soon, the real impact will hit Russia,"" said Smart. ""They can't import medicines. They won't import spare parts for their airplanes. They won't have access to any kind of investment to develop their oil fields.""Smart predicted Russia will have a lot of ""knockoffs and lookalike cars and cellphones"" imported from China.Barring a major change in regime that puts Putin out of power, Hess of the Foreign Policy Research Institute predicted that in five years Russians ""will be living in some version of the '90s and potentially even something worse,"" if Putin decides to further manipulate the currency or to weaponize commodities.Even as the Russian economy reels from sanctions that are a direct result of Putin's war, the increasingly isolated president himself remains very firmly in control of the country. Still, that doesn't mean he's invincible.""Putin has premised his rule on making sure that people don't have to live in the living standards and the ways they lived in the 90s again,"" said Hess. And for most of his time in power, Putin has lived up to his end of that bargain.When he was first elected president in 2000, he took the helm of a country where 38% of the population lived on less than $5.50 per day, according to World Bank data using 2011 price values. By 2018, that figure had fallen by more than 90%, to just 3.7% of the population.During that time, millions of Russians bought foreign cars and microwaves and TVs. They dressed in brands like Diesel and Mango and Benetton, and they began to take holidays abroad. But if average Russians start to see their standard of living fall as a result of the Ukraine invasion, experts say Putin could have a real problem, given the unwritten social contract he has with voters.""The deal was that [Putin] would end the chaos of the 1990s and allow people to be domestically and financially successful,"" said Barry Ickes, head of the economics department at Penn State University. ""In exchange, the people would agree not to challenge Putin's political power. And that's been his deal ever since.""This contract helps to explain how Putin has retained power for two decades, and why so many levels of Russian society have tolerated his evolution into a full-blown autocrat. But it's also the key to understanding his vulnerability, experts said.For years, the Kremlin has argued that for Russians the freedom to travel and spend money is more important than less tangible freedoms like the freedom to protest against the government.""In the early 1990s our people were paupers — and it's ridiculous to say they were free,"" Vladislav Surkov, a leading Kremlin ideologist, said in a 2006 Financial Times interview. ""When you have a car to ride in and things to buy, that's freedom.""If Putin cannot provide ""stability and a good level of economic support"" to average Russians, said Ickes, then he risks looking as though he's not honoring the social contract.As the war in Ukraine carries into its third week, both stability and economic support are becoming harder for Putin to provide over. Again and again, investors and policy experts said it's nearly impossible to envision a realistic scenario in which American companies would resume operations in Russia within the next five years. ""Once companies leave [Russia] they take some costs and book them on their accounts. And then there's an environment where you've already taken these losses, so it's a lot harder to convince your risk committee to go back in,"" said Hess.Given the direct impact that sanctions are having on the business climate in Russia, securing a full or partial lifting of them is key to making American companies want to come back. But none of the experts who spoke to CNBC for this story believe that any of the current sanctions against Russia or Belarus are going to be eased or lifted for at least the next three years.""Until you have a new leader in Russia, one who apologizes for invading Ukraine and who writes a check for reparations, these sanctions are going to remain in place,"" said Smart, of Barings. ""And I don't see any of the three things I just described happening.""Underscoring this is the fact that the current sanctions do not even contain any language about what Russia could do to convince Washington to lift them.For Smart, the best way to understand the Western effort to isolate the Kremlin is to view it as a long-term strategic move, within a 10- to 20-year window.Russia ""is the 11th largest economy in the world, and we're about to seal it up in a container and not do business with it for the foreseeable future,"" he said.For everyday consumers, the coming months will test how much of the modern world they are willing to give up to further Putin's ambitions of control over Eastern Europe. ""Until recently, [Putin's] whole program was relatively popular,"" said Ickes, of Penn State. ""It's the last two weeks where there's been a major shift.""""Now the loss of international travel is painful. And the loss of the internet is painful. And your debit card doesn't work anymore. That's a big, big, big, deal,"" he said."
2022-03-14,"The Federal Reserve meets this week and is expected to begin unwinding the massive economic help it provided during the pandemic.That process will likely start with an interest rate hike of a quarter percentage point, but policymakers also will update their outlook for rates as well as GDP, inflation and unemployment.At the last update, officials projected inflation would run at 2.7% — obviously a massive undershoot of current conditions. The Federal Reserve this week faces the monumental challenge of starting to undo its massive economic help at a time when conditions are far from ideal.In the midst of a geopolitical crisis in Ukraine, an economy that is off to a slow start and a stock market in a state of tumult, the Fed is widely expected to start raising interest rates following the conclusion Wednesday of its two-day meeting.Those three elements pose a daunting challenge, but it's soaring inflation that the Fed will focus on most when its meeting starts Tuesday. ""The economic outlook supports the Fed's current plans to boost the federal funds rate in March and to begin to reduce their balance sheet over the summer,"" wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds. ""However, there [are] a number of areas of uncertainty which should make them a little more cautious in tightening.""The Federal Open Market Committee meeting will be focusing on more than a solitary interest rate hike, however. There also will be adjustments to the economic outlook, projections for the future path of rates, and likely a discussion about when the central bank can start reducing its bond portfolio holdings.Here's a look at how each will play out, according to the prevailing views on Wall Street: Markets have no doubt the Fed will enact an increase of a quarter-percentage point, or 25 basis points, at this meeting. Because the central bank generally doesn't like to surprise markets, that's almost certainly what will happen.Where the committee goes from there, however, is hard to tell. Members will update their projections through the ""dot plot"" — in which each official plots one dot on a grid to show where they think rates will go this year, the following two years and the longer range.""The '25' is a given. What matters most is what comes after,"" said Simona Mocuta, chief economist at State Street Global Advisors. ""A lot can happen between now and the end of the year. The uncertainty is super high. The trade-offs have worsened considerably."" Current pricing indicates the equivalent of seven total increases this year — or one at each meeting — a pace Mocuta thinks is too aggressive. However, traders are split evenly over whether the FOMC will hike by 25 or 50 basis points in May should inflation — currently at its highest level since the early 1980s — continue to push higher. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.From a market perspective, the key assessment will be whether the hike is ""dovish"" — indicative of a cautious path ahead — or ""hawkish,"" in which officials signal they are determined to keep raising rates to fight inflation even if there are some adverse effects on growth.""We think the message around the rate hike has to be at least somewhat hawkish. The real question is whether the Fed is carefully hawkish or aggressively hawkish, and whether the meeting springs any surprises or not,"" wrote Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy for Evercore ISI. ""Our call is that the Fed will be carefully hawkish and will avoid springing any surprises that might add to uncertainty and volatility.""Regardless of exactly how it goes, the dot plot will see substantial revisions from the last update three months ago, in which members penciled in just three hikes this year and about six more over the next two years. The longer run, or terminal rate, also could get boosted up from the 2.5% projection. The dot plot is part of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) , a table updated quarterly that also includes rough estimates for unemployment, gross domestic product and inflation.In December, the committee's median expectation for inflation, as gauged by its core preferred personal consumption expenditures price index, pointed to inflation in 2022 running at 2.7%. That figure obviously vastly underestimated the trajectory of inflation, which by February's core PCE reading is up 5.2% from a year ago.Wall Street economists expect the new inflation outlook to bump up the full-year estimate to about 4%, though gains in subsequent years are expected to move little from December's respective projections of 2.3% and 2.1%.

December's SEP pointed to GDP growth of 4% this year; Goldman Sachs recently lowered its full-year outlook to just 2.9%. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow gauge is tracking first-quarter growth of just 0.5%.""The war has pushed the Fed staff's geopolitical risk index to the highest level since the Iraq War,"" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a note over the weekend. ""It has already raised food and energy prices and it threatens to create new supply chain disruptions as well.""The Fed's December projection for unemployment this year was 3.5%, which could be tweaked lower considering the February rate was 3.8%. Outside the questions over rates, inflation and growth, the Fed also is expected to discuss when it will start paring the bond holdings on its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. To be sure, the central bank is not expected to take any firm action on this issue this week.The bond-buying program, sometimes called quantitative easing, will wind down this month with a final round of $16.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities purchases. As that ends, the FOMC will start to chart the way it will allow the holdings to start reducing, a program sometimes conversely called quantitative tightening.""Balance sheet reduction will likely be discussed but increased uncertainty makes us think formal normalization principles will be announced in May or June,"" Citi's Hollenhorst said.Most Wall Street estimates figure the Fed will allow about $100 billion in bond proceeds to roll off each month, rather than being reinvested in new bonds as is currently the case. That process is expected to start in the summer, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell likely will be asked to address it during his post-meeting news conference.Powell's Q&A with the press sometimes moves markets more than the actual post-meeting statement. Mocuta, the State Street economist, said given that Fed policy acts with a lag, generally considered to be six months to a year, Powell should focus more on the future rather than the present.""The question remains, where are you going to be in the middle of 2023?"" she said. ""How is inflation, how is growth going to look then? This is the reason I think the Fed should be more dovish and should communicate that."""
2022-03-15,"The Federal Reserve is poised to announce its first interest rate hike since 2018 on Wednesday.The central bank is likely to raise its target federal funds rate by 25 basis points to address the worst inflation in more than 40 years, partially brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.Yet consumers who are already grappling with higher prices putting a strain on their wallets may be wondering how increasing borrowing costs will help tamp down inflation. The consumer price index soared to a 7.9% annual rate in February, the highest level since January 1982. Rising costs of items such as food and fuel drove the increase and further eroded any wage gains that workers may have seen in the last year.More from Invest in You:Want to give your finances a spring cleaning? First, get organizedHere's what to know about managing your debt in retirementWant to find financial success? Here's how to get started""This is something really hard for the typical consumer to understand, seeing these fast price raises that are so unfamiliar to large parts of our population who haven't seen inflation rates like this before,"" said Tara Sinclair, a senior fellow at the Indeed Hiring Lab. ""And then trying to figure out the Fed's complicated role in all of this is very confusing.""Here's what you need to know.The Fed's mandateThe Federal Reserve has a few main goals with respect to the economy: to promote maximum employment, keep prices stable and ensure moderate long-term interest rates.Generally, the central bank aims to keep inflation around 2% annually, a number that lagged before the pandemic. Its main tool to battle inflation is interest rates. It does that by setting the short-term borrowing rate for commercial banks, and then those banks pass rates along to consumers and businesses, said Yiming Ma, an assistant finance professor at Columbia University Business School.That higher rate influences the interest you pay on everything from credit cards to mortgages to car loans, making borrowing more expensive. On the flip side, it also boosts rates on savings accounts.Interest rates and the economyBut how do higher interest rates reel in inflation? They help by slowing down the economy, according to the experts.""The Fed uses interest rates as either a gas pedal or a brake on the economy when needed,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. ""With inflation running high, they can raise interest rates and use that to pump the brakes on the economy in an effort to get inflation under control.""  Basically, the Fed policymakers aim to make borrowing more expensive so that consumers and businesses hold off on making any investments, thereby cooling off demand and hopefully holding down prices. There could also be a secondary effect of alleviating supply chain issues, one of the main reasons that prices are spiking right now, said McBride. Still, the central back can't directly influence or solve that particular problem, he said.""As long as the supply chain is an issue, we're likely to be contending with outside wage gains,"" which drive inflation, he said.What the Fed wants to avoidThe main worry for economists is that the Fed raises interest rates too quickly and dampens demand too much, stalling the economy.This could lead to higher unemployment if businesses stop hiring or even lay off workers. If policymakers really overshoot on rate hikes, it could push the economy into a recession, halting and reversing the progress it has made so far.Treating inflation in the economy is like treating cancer with chemotherapy, said Sinclair of the Indeed Hiring Lab. ""You have to kill parts of the economy to slow things down,"" she said. ""It's not a pleasant treatment.""Of course, it will take some time for any action to affect the economy and curb inflation. That's why the Federal Open Market Committee carefully watches economic data to decide how much and how frequently to raise rates.There is also some uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine, which has also increased prices on commodities such as gas. The Fed will have to watch how the war is hampering the U.S. economy and act accordingly.It might get worse before it gets betterWhen the Fed does lift rates, it's also likely that people will see the downsides of those increases before any improvement on inflation, said Sinclair.Basically, that means consumers may have to pay more to borrow money and still see higher prices at the gas pump and grocery store. That scenario is particularly tough on low-income workers, who have seen wages rise but not keep pace with inflation.Of course, ideally the central bank would like to raise rates gradually so that the economy slows just enough to bring down prices without creating too much additional unemployment.""They have to carefully walk that tightrope,"" said Sinclair.SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

BEIJING — China reported Tuesday better-than-expected growth in retail sales, fixed asset investment and industrial production to start the year.The data releases combine the two months of January and February as is the Chinese statistics bureau custom to avoid distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which can fall in either month depending on the year.Retail sales grew by 6.7% year-on-year, topping expectations of analysts polled by Reuters for growth of 3% from a year ago. Furniture was the only category within retail sales to decline, down 6%. Petroleum products and gold, silver and jewelry saw the greatest increases.Steady growth in auto sales — after declines for much of last year — helped boost retail sales, as well as consumer demand around the Lunar New Year holiday and interest in Olympics-related products, Fu Linghui, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters at a press conference Tuesday.He noted, however, that recent Covid outbreaks would likely restrict consumption in certain areas, and the foundation for recovery in consumer spending is still not strong.""Certainly, achieving the full-year target of around 5.5% will require arduous effort,"" Fu said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation. Industrial production also beat, up by 7.5% versus expectations of 3.9% growth.Fixed asset investment rose by 12.2%, well above the forecast for a 5% increase. Within fixed asset investment, that in high-tech manufacturing saw one of the largest increases, up by 42.7%. Infrastructure investment grew by 8.1%. Investment in real estate development rose by 3.7%, even as commercial floor space sold fell by 9.6%.The real estate sector — which contributes to about a quarter of GDP — has slumped since Beijing began a crackdown on developers' high reliance on debt in the last two years.Sian Fenner, lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics, said on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" that she expects increased fiscal spending will boost infrastructure development, but not enough to offset the slowdown in real estate. She anticipates the stimulus will work through the economy, enough to boost growth to an expected 4.9% this year and to near 5.4% next year.

2022-03-15,"The Federal Reserve is expected to end its two-day meeting Wednesday with its first interest rate hike since 2018.After raising rates by a quarter point, the central bank is expected to forecast as many as a half-dozen increases for the year. Some Fed watchers say the economic outlook is so uncertain that it may not be able to raise rates as much as it would like.Fed Chair Jerome Powell could be aggressive about additional rate hikes when he discusses the need to boost rates because of spiking inflation. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter point Wednesday, a major step in reversing the extraordinary easing it put in place two years ago to help the economy through the pandemic.Fed watchers expect the central bank will also provide a new quarterly forecast that could show as many as five or six more quarter-point hikes this year, and possibly three or four more in 2023. The central bank's tone may also sound hawkish, meaning it will emphasize that it intends to keep boosting rates to combat high inflation.This time, policymakers are facing unique issues that it did not see several months ago. Economists say there are increasing risks to economic growth that the Fed may not be able to raise rates as much as it would like. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made already hot inflation worse and has created more risks for growth. What's more, the pandemic may have subsided in most of the U.S., but it is raging in China, where there are lockdowns that threaten more supply chain disruptions and slower growth.""There's a dark cloud of uncertainty over this meeting, but at the end of the day, they know they're at zero,"" said Jim Caron, chief fixed income strategist on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.""The economy is coming into full employment rapidly and inflation is way too high,"" he said. ""You add that all up and that means they've got to raise rates. The degree of uncertainty is extraordinary. They told us what they're going to do. They did that to get rid of the uncertainty.""Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been direct, guiding expectations on the timing and size of the first rate hike when he testified before Congress earlier this month.When the pandemic broke out, the Fed quickly took its fed funds target rate range to zero to 0.25% in early 2020. It also began a number of programs to add liquidity, including the quantitative easing program to buy Treasurys and mortgage bonds that it is just winding down this month.But with headline consumer inflation at an annual 7.9% in February, some economists view the Fed as starting well behind the curve in its fight with rapidly rising prices. Treasury yields have been increasing quickly, as market pros position for hotter inflation and Fed rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.12% Tuesday, after touching 2.14% Monday, its highest since July 2019. Yields move opposite prices. ""I think the world really changed with this war, and [it] would have been an inflation that would have come down by the middle of this year. It would have come down to more normalized levels,"" said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. ""The impact on energy, commodities, food are real. I just think it really changed the inflationary paradigm to be significantly worse.""The Fed is also hiking rates at a time of turbulence in financial markets. Stocks have been skidding because of uneasiness surrounding Ukraine and concerns about rising interest rates. Oil prices have taken a wild ride, surging to $130 per barrel last week before falling back Tuesday to about $97 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude futures.

I suspect financial conditions are going to tighten significantly and do some of the work for the Fed,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""The Fed is desperately trying to balance things and avoid going into recession. It really does depend on what happens with the stock market, credit spreads, sentiment ... and whatever other geopolitical problems come down the road.""Zandi said he's not expecting a recession, but the odds of it happening have risen to 1 in 3 in the next 12 to 18 months.""The Fed's immediate reaction is going to be to fight inflation, but down the road it has to look at slower growth from higher oil prices,"" said Zandi. ""That's an important unique aspect this, but at the same time we have to put this in context; the Fed is already late to the game.""Fed forecastsThe Fed will be releasing new forecasts for growth and inflation, in addition to interest rates, on Wednesday. The central bank's so-called ""dot plot"" is a chart that shows where individual Fed officials expect interest rates to fall.""I think they're going to downgrade [gross domestic product] significantly. They're going to upgrade inflation significantly, and more people will talk about stagflation,"" BlackRock's Rieder said. ""But I think the U.S. economy, the consumer … and corporates are still in tremendous shape. I think talking about recession is very premature, but talking about significant economic slowdown is not only not premature but I think it should be the base case.""BlackRock expects the Fed's projections to now show GDP growing at a 2.8% pace in 2022, down from 4% in its December forecast.Morgan Stanley's Caron said he expects the Fed to raise its consensus forecast to signal that headline consumer price inflation could be at 4% to 5%. In the central bank's projections, it uses a different metric and currently forecasts personal consumption expenditures' inflation at 2.7% for 2022. Caron said that could move up to 3% or higher.""They're going to be hawkish by definition, but there's danger. I already expect them to put in the dot plot they are hiking five to six times, and even some people would say that's not enough,"" Caron said.Bank of America's Mark Cabana said the market may look past some of the forecasts because the outlook has become so uncertain. ""We don't think the market is going to care all that much. The market has been leading the Fed,"" he said. The Fed's asset purchase program helped grow the central bank's balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion, and it could provide some guidance on when it will start winding down that program. The Wall Street consensus is that the Fed will begin to pare back the balance sheet in June, but with rising uncertainty that is now something that could possibly change.Cabana said he expects the Fed to provide more detail of how it will unwind the balance sheet, which more than doubled since the pandemic. It could decrease its level of holdings by discontinuing its practice of automatically replacing securities as they mature. The process is termed quantitative tightening, or QT.""That they will be ready to flip the switch on QT in May, that is our base case, but we acknowledge there are risks that this will be skewed later,"" said Cabana. He said if the Fed decided to slow its tightening, it might hold off on the balance sheet before it stops raising interest rates.Slow rate hikes?Rieder said he expects the Fed to hold off on some of the rate hikes forecast for this year.""I think they have to get to neutral, and there's no ambiguity around the fact that being easy and accommodative is the wrong stance,"" said Rieder. ""You've got to get to 1% funds rate and then let's say you get there by late spring, early summer and then you have to evaluate an economy that's slowing.""""I think the median dots are going to be somewhere between five and six hikes this year, and I don't' think they're going to get that in,"" he added.Participants in a CNBC Fed survey forecast the Fed will hike rates an average of 4.7 times this year. That would take the fed funds rate to end the year at 1.4%. They expect it to be at 2% by the end of 2023. Nearly half of the respondents see the central bank boosting rates five to seven times this year.Analysts see the Fed as walking the equivalent of a policy tightrope. If it does not tighten enough, inflation will slam the economy. If it tightens too much, it could slow the economy.Reider said surging inflation is already hurting the economy and that could be a problem for policymakers.""You see the consumer-sentiment numbers have really fallen off in dramatic fashion,"" he said.""It puts the Fed in a place that makes their job much harder. I don't think it speeds up the Fed. I think it will ultimately slow the Fed down,"" Rieder added."
2022-03-16,"Three million migrants have so far fled the war in Ukraine, with more than half going to Poland.The influx is putting considerable strain on Polish authorities and humanitarian aid agencies, with questions arising as to how the European Union will provide support.An inflow of 5 million migrants could cost the EU $55 billion in 2022 alone, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. But as the war continues, the movement of people could tick much higher. In less than three weeks, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent 3 million people fleeing their homes to neighboring countries — with still millions more displaced domestically — in what has quickly become Europe's worst migrant crisis since World War II.While the majority have been compassionately welcomed by host countries rejecting President Vladimir Putin's indiscriminate attack, the sudden influx of people is having a profound impact on the European landscape — with potentially significant consequences.Nowhere is that impact more pronounced than in Poland. Since the start of the war on Feb. 24, Poland has welcomed over 1.8 million refugees — almost twice the 1 million authorities had anticipated and increasing its population by 4.8%.The east European country is a natural point of entry for Ukrainians owing to their 530-kilometer shared land border, as well as numerous historical, cultural and economic ties. Indeed, there is already a sizeable Ukrainian diaspora in Poland following an earlier spate of migration after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. But as the number of refugees requiring humanitarian assistance spirals well beyond initial estimates, it is putting considerable strain on the government and the dozens of relief agencies that have mobilized to help them.""First, all of the people knew where they wanted to go. They had some friends they wanted to stay with [in Poland],"" said Dominika Chylewska, head of communications at Caritas Polska, a charity offering relief to migrants at Polish reception points including Przemysl, a city 12 kilometers from Ukraine's border. Others still planned to travel further afield to Berlin, Prague and Tallinn, she said.""Now, we already see that there are more people coming without any final destination,"" said Chylewska. That raises questions about the long-term fate of those migrants and what more the European Union will do to support host countries like Poland.""It puts the EU in a bind,"" said Adriano Bosoni, director of analysis at intelligence firm RANE, highlighting decisions the bloc will face around financial aid and permanent residency. So far, the EU has assigned 500 million euros ($547 million) for humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Yet estimates from the Economist Intelligence Unit suggest that the cost of supporting 5 million refugees could be 50 billion euros in 2022 alone.Meantime, the bloc has activated a never-before used Temporary Protection Directive granting Ukrainian nationals the right to live and work in host countries for up to three years.Longer term, however, it will have to decide if it will offer permanent asylum to migrants, and how it might redistribute them across the bloc to ease the burden on primary hosts like Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Moldova.""The [Polish] government will not be able to cope with the crisis without extensive assistance from the EU. This includes both financial assistance and resettlements of refugees,"" said Alessandro Cugnasca, country risk service manager at the EIU. Even before the crisis, Poland, a country of almost 38 million, was undergoing a demographic shift.In the years since joining the EU in 2004, the Eastern European nation has experienced high levels of emigration as skilled workers have headed west to other member states, seeking higher wages and increased opportunities.Meanwhile, a falling fertility rate — driven, like many of its Western peers, by greater sex education, higher female workforce participation, and increased urbanization — has added to the country's overall population decline. That could make Poland — already one of Europe's fastest growing economies before Covid — a grateful recipient of long-term, skilled workers, said Bosoni.""Importing millions of young Ukrainian workers who can join your workforce and contribute makes sense from an economic point of view,"" he said, citing the high education level of migrants, mostly women and children, from Ukraine.But still, the political risks for Poland and its neighbors are notable. Migration can be a political hot potato, with the 2015 Europe migrant crisis thought to have bolstered far-right movements that swelled across the continent in the years that followed. At that time, Poland was reluctant in accepting migrants, largely from Syria and North Africa — a fact that has not gone unnoticed in its response to Ukraine.""Polish citizens remain very supportive of Ukrainian refugees. But the crisis has the potential to cause political instability over the medium term,"" noted EIU's Cugnasca.""War refugees, unlike labor migrants, will require significant financial support from the state and this could lead to a political backlash down the road,"" he added, pointing to Poland's next parliamentary election due in 2023. Of course, the longer term implications will depend largely on the outcome of the conflict, analysts agreed.If, as many fear, Russia succeeds in its invasion and installs a pro-Kremlin government, the likelihood of migrants returning home is far lower.But if, as Western allies hope, there is a resolution to the conflict that restores a sovereign Ukraine, the majority of migrants may choose to return home and embark on the lengthy task of rebuilding their war-torn country.""Most who left would like to be able to go back,"" said Bosoni. ""They are not economic migrants, they are people escaping war and death."""
2022-03-16,"In the last few days, mainland China has seen its worst Covid outbreak since the initial height of the pandemic in early 2020 — when the economy contracted.""Economic loss may be real this time,"" Citi analysts said in a report, estimating the outbreak could hit China's first quarter GDP by at least half of a percentage point.Economists said it's too early to tell what the full-year impact of lockdown measures is as some may last only a week or two. BEIJING — China's latest Covid-19 outbreak could hit first-quarter gross domestic product by at least half of a percentage point, Citi analysts predicted in a report Tuesday.In the last few days, mainland China has seen its worst Covid outbreak since the initial height of the pandemic in early 2020 — when the economy contracted. The latest surge in cases, which stems from the highly transmissible omicron variant, has forced some manufacturing hubs across the country to suspend or limit production.The most affected regions account for 16.7% of national GDP, according to Citi estimates.""Economic loss may be real this time,"" the analysts said. ""Jointly considering the spillover effect to other regions, we think the lockdown and tightened quarantine measures this round could potentially deduct ~0.5-0.8 ppt of GDP growth in Q1, assuming no policy responses.""Mainland China reported 1,860 confirmed Covid cases for Tuesday, down from more than 3,500 new cases a day earlier. The country has not reported new deaths, and the number of new cases is still far lower than in other parts of the world, such as Europe. Beijing's zero-Covid policy measures have prompted analysts to issue reports about growing risks of drags on the world's second-largest economy, even if few are able to put a number on it yet. ""We believe the omicron wave presents both risks and opportunities for China,"" Bank of America Securities' China equity strategy team said in a report Tuesday.If the pandemic is managed well, the analysts said, the outbreaks could help China prepare to reopen its borders. But if not, they said the omicron wave ""could cause significant downside to China's GDP growth and disruption to the global supply chains in the near term, and potentially accelerate the decoupling and supply chain relocation in the medium term.""So far, the analysts' research and checks with local factories reveal limited impact on the production of chips, autos, apparel and beer, among other industries. The Android smartphone supply chain could be among the harder-hit, the report said. But, like other industries, production could be shifted to other locations.For autos, the analysts said that ""according to channel checks, a couple of Shanghai-based names saw bigger disruption, while BYD's Shenzhen plant is operating normally as of 14th March.""BYD did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The lockdown and production suspension measures announced by Shenzhen and Dongguan — two manufacturing hubs in the export-heavy province of Guangdong — will last only about a week.Economic data for January and February reported on Tuesday came in well above expectations, and the National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson said the impact of the virus would mostly be at a local level.""March may be a different picture depending on how long the restrictions in Shenzhen and Jilin last for,"" said Francoise Huang, senior economist at Euler Hermes, a subsidiary of Allianz. ""If it just lasts for one or two weeks, it might become a blip in the data.""The latest Covid wave has hit the northern Chinese province of Jilin the hardest, with the region accounting for the majority of daily new cases. The province banned travel to other parts of China on Monday, and is building emergency hospitals.Although Jilin's capital of Changchun is an auto manufacturing center, contribution to China's GDP is 0.65%, less than Dongguan's 0.95% and Shenzhen's 2.73% share, according to Citi. China has upheld a zero-Covid policy of travel restrictions and swift lockdowns of neighborhoods or office towers to control outbreaks. At least in Beijing, individuals with a travel history linked to confirmed cases may need to quarantine at home for a week or more.But the implementation of the policy has been targeted.For example, a Shanghai government official said Tuesday there is no need to lock down the city to control the outbreak. And while Shenzhen has ordered overall production halts and remote work, its ports largely remain open.""We have been notified that all ports and terminals in Shenzhen (Yantian and Chiwan) are currently working as normal,"" shipping giant Maersk said in a statement. ""This includes vessel operations, yard handling and gate-in-and-out.""""However, local warehouses have been closed and trucking services have been impacted due to the lockdown. In other Chinese ports, there hasn't been any operational impact, but landside transportation efficiency has been reduced,"" the company said.The Yantian port said in an online statement Monday it was operating normally.The Shenzhen government announced Tuesday the closure of the Liantang Port at the land border with Hong Kong. Shenzhen has reported several confirmed Covid cases from freight drivers across that border, but no announcements of other port closures.

2022-03-16,"The Federal Reserve raised rates Wednesday for the first time since 2018. The central bank also unveiled its latest economic growth and inflation projections, while noting that it expects to raise rates six more times in 2022. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell then took questions from reporters, and his answers sparked sharp moves across financial markets. Here's a full recap below.   Wed, Mar 16 20223:24 PM EDT Powell said that the Fed doesn't see evidence of a wage-price spiral at the moment but there is a ""misalignment"" of supply and demand in the labor market.""What we have now, if you look at the wage increases that we have ... the increases are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2% inflation, our goal, over time,"" he said.The idea of a wage-price spiral is one factor for how inflation becomes more persistent, with workers demanding higher wages to pay for more expensive items, thus driving prices up even more. The Fed Chair did say that some areas of the economy that saw hot wage growth last year appeared to be normalizing some now, suggesting that a spiral was not in effect.—Jesse Pound  Wed, Mar 16 20223:19 PM EDT The Fed could start reducing the size of the holdings on its balance sheet as soon as May, Chairman Jerome Powell said.In the post-meeting statement Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee indicated that the central bank ""expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.""During his press conference, Powell provided some color on when and how that can happen. He noted that the FOMC made ""exceptional progress"" at this meeting in getting the process started, and he said implementation could come ""at our next meeting in May.""""The framework is going to look very familiar to people who are familiar with the last time we did this,"" he said. ""But it will be faster than the last time and of course it's much sooner in the cycle than last time.""Its last balance sheet reduction, from 2017-19, saw the Fed allow a set level of proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off each month while reinvesting the rest. Powell's comments indicate this time will be more aggressive than the $50 billion a month the Fed used in the prior case.Years of bond buying have pushed the Fed's balance sheet to just shy of $9 trillion. Markets expect that to be cut by several trillion dollars in the coming iteration. —Fred Imbert  Wed, Mar 16 20223:15 PM EDT When asked if higher interest rates could potentially lead to higher unemployment rates, Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the Fed's focus on achieving price stability by addressing inflation.""Without price stability, you really can't have a sustained period of maximum employment,"" Powell said. ""The plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. That is our intention and we believe we can do that. But we have to restore price stability."" —Hannah Miao  Wed, Mar 16 20223:11 PM EDT Shares of major technology companies jumped Wednesday as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell answered questions from reporters following the central bank's first rate hike in three years.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms popped nearly 4%, while Amazon and Netflix each gained more than 2%. Microsoft climbed 0.7%, and Apple advanced 1.4%.—Fred Imbert  Wed, Mar 16 20223:03 PM EDT The major U.S. stock averages seesawed as traders listened carefully to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's news conference. The Dow, which briefly traded more than 100 points lower after the Fed statement was released, was up about 90 points as of 3 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up by 0.9% and 2.1%, respectively. —Fred Imbert  Wed, Mar 16 20222:56 PM EDT —Fred Imbert  Wed, Mar 16 20222:50 PM EDT The Federal Reserve expects inflation to return to 2%, but the comeback will take longer than initially expected, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said during a press conference following the agency's rate hike decision.""As we emphasize in our policy statement, with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to return to 2%, while the labor market remains strong,"" he said.The median inflation projection among FOMC members is 4.3% for the year, Powell said. He noted that the trajectory through 2024 is ""notably higher"" than initial December projections.— Samantha Subin  Wed, Mar 16 20222:48 PM EDT When asked what would trigger the Fed to adjust the pace of its rate hikes, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could speed up its plans if more aggressive monetary tightening is needed.""The way we're thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting,"" Powell said. ""We're going to be looking at evolving conditions and if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then we'll do so.""""I can't be perfectly specific about it. But that's certainly a possibility as we go through the year,"" he added.—Hannah Miao  Wed, Mar 16 20222:49 PM EDT While the U.S. economy faces a myriad of risks, including a massive surge in inflation, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell still thinks recession chances are low.""The probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated,"" Powell said. ""Aggregate demand is currently strong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so.""""All signs are that this is a strong economy,"" he said. —Fred Imbert  Wed, Mar 16 20222:43 PM EDT Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is set to start reducing the asset holdings on its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet at a future policy meeting.""We expect to announce the beginning of balance sheet reduction at an upcoming meeting,"" Powell said at the post-March meeting press conference.""In making decisions about interest rates and the balance sheet, we will be mindful of the broader contexts in markets and in the economy, and we will use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability,"" he added.—Hannah Miao  Wed, Mar 16 20222:41 PM EDT Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the big jump in inflation expectations from Fed officials, saying that ""inflation is likely to take longer to return to our price-stability goal than previously expected."" Powell added that ""participants continue to see risks as weighted to the upside"" on inflation.Check out Powell's opening remarks below: —Jesse Pound  Wed, Mar 16 20222:39 PM EDT While the Fed's projection of six more hikes this year is in line with expectations, the risk still exists that the central bank could tighten monetary policy too fast and hinder economic growth, according to Mike Loewengart, E-Trade's managing director of investment strategy.""Keep in mind that the risk remains that attempting to tame inflation by raising rates crosses the line from cooling a too-hot economy to freezing it, which could pressure corporate earnings and, ultimately, stock prices,"" Lowerngart said.""That said, the Fed raising rates means a vote of confidence that the economy is in shape enough to weather tighter policies,"" he added.— Yun Li  Wed, Mar 16 20222:34 PM EDT The Fed expects to raise rates at each of its remaining meetings this year. However, future rate increases ""will come with caveats,"" Giles Coghlan of HYCM said.""We may see a more dovish approach to tightening, rather than the aggressive approach we have been primed for over the past year. But today, we traders and investors could see a 'buy the rumour, sell the fact' response to the announcement, which would favour upside in stocks, gains for gold and silver, as well as EURUSD upside and a drop in US 10 year yields,"" Coghlan said.—Fred Imbert, Tanaya Macheel  Wed, Mar 16 20222:30 PM EDT David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC on Wednesday he believes the Fed is overdoing it by projecting six more interest rate hikes this year.""I'm not surprised the Dow is down. I think this is a very aggressive move,"" he said on ""Power Lunch,"" alluding to the fact the 30-stock average briefly went negative as investors processed the Fed's post-meeting statement.""I just want the Fed to maintain some flexibility. In the long run, we have to get rates back to positive real levels,"" Kelly said. ""But there's a lot of uncertainty out here, and remember we've got a lot of financial assets which are built on the edifice of super low rates, and you can't just raise those rates up to normal levels overnight and expect nothing bad to happen.""Kelly said he thinks the Fed should stretch out the rate-hike cycle and put more emphasis on reducing its balance sheet instead.—Kevin Stankiewicz  Wed, Mar 16 20222:24 PM EDT Federal Reserve officials see higher inflation and lower economic growth in 2022 than they did in December, according to the new economic projections released by the Federal Open Markets Committee on Wednesday.The Fed now projects 4.3% PCE inflation in 2022, up from 2.6% in December. The central bank expects that to decline to 2.7% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024, but those are also above the December projections.For economic growth, the Fed now sees 2.8% GDP growth in 2022, down from 4.0% in previous projections.—Jesse Pound  Wed, Mar 16 20222:17 PM EDT The Dow turned negative on the day after the Fed approved its first interest rate hike in more than three years and signaled that more hikes are to come.The 30-stock average traded just below the flatline, after rallying as much as 531 points earlier in the day.

This marks the first rate hike since 2018.In its post-meeting statement, the FOMC said it also ""anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.""

These challenges include Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has worsened already hot inflation, and turbulence in financial markets. The S&P 500 is down more than 3% in the past month and is trading in correction territory — down more than 10% from a record high reached in early January. After Wednesday's likely rate hike, the Fed is expected to raise rates as many as six more times. However, Morgan Stanley Investment Management's Jim Caron said there's a ""dark cloud of uncertainty over this meeting.""""The economy is coming into full employment rapidly and inflation is way too high,"" he said.

2022-03-17,"Last year, the pandemic pushed 4.7 million more people in Southeast Asia into extreme poverty and erased 9.3 million jobs in the region, the Asian Development Bank said in a report published Wednesday.ADB expects growth of 5.1% in 2022 as higher vaccination rates prompt economies to reopen, but warns that the new variant could cut growth by as much as 0.8%.It urged Southeast Asian governments to invest more in their health-care systems to boost economic growth. Southeast Asia is grappling with high poverty levels as recurring waves of Covid-19 have dealt a blow to the region's labor market, said the Asian Development Bank.Last year, the pandemic pushed 4.7 million more people in Southeast Asia into extreme poverty — which is defined as those living on less than $1.90 per day — and erased 9.3 million jobs in the region, the ADB said in a report published on Wednesday.related investing newsThese US stocks have the most to lose — and gain — from ChinaYun Li2 days ago""The pandemic has led to widespread unemployment, worsening inequality, and rising poverty levels, especially among women, younger workers, and the elderly in Southeast Asia,"" said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa.Many countries in Southeast Asia have lost their hard-won economic and development gains as they continue to struggle with the spread of the omicron Covid variant.Though ADB expects growth of 5.1% in 2022 as higher vaccination rates prompt economies to reopen, it warned that the new variant could cut growth by as much as 0.8%.The countries with the highest number of reported Covid-19 cases in the region since the pandemic began are Vietnam (6.55 million), Indonesia (5.91 million), and Malaysia (3.87 million) — all developing ones — online publication Our World In Data showed.""The pandemic's impact on poverty and unemployment will likely persist as inactive workers become de-skilled and poor people's access to opportunities further deteriorates,"" ADB said. ""When this happens, the deterioration in inequality will transfer across generations."" Despite the volatility the pandemic has created, ADB is optimistic that Southeast Asian economies are beginning to recover.Southeast Asian countries have mostly been ""taking care of their own house"" since the Asian financial crisis, and that has put them in a better position to ""weather the storm"" of the pandemic, said ADB Vice President Ahmed Saeed. The region, which relies heavily on its tourism industry for growth, expects to see the sector gradually pick up as travel borders begin to open, providing more opportunities for economic growth and jobs.""Tourism tends to bounce back and to be more robust through the cycle than we expected,"" Saeed told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Wednesday.""Would additional waves of the Covid virus and variants set that back? Yes. But I think ... once the clouds clear ... we will ultimately get back past our 2019 tourism numbers across the region and beyond those,"" he added.But Southeast Asia still has a long way to go.Although overall international tourist arrivals increased by 58% in July to September 2021 compared with the same period in 2020, it remained 64% below 2019 levels, the report stated.""At present, tourism related goods and services including transport, accommodation, recreation, and other personal services will likely remain weak while travel remains curtailed and social distancing is enforced,"" ADB said. To expedite the region's economic recovery, ADB urged Southeast Asian governments to invest more in their health-care systems.While the virus could cause long-term damage to economies by causing severe disruptions to supply chains and labor markets, a lack of investment in health care is also worsening inequality, the bank said.Allocating more resources would ""help health systems deliver care, improve disease surveillance, and respond to future pandemics,"" the bank said.ADB said Southeast Asia's economic growth could increase by 1.5% if health spending in the region reaches about 5% of gross domestic product, compared with 3% in 2021.""Countries that had greater internal health care capacity, greater levels of wealth ... managed to come through this process better than"" middle- and low-income countries that lack health-care systems and infrastructure, Saeed said."
2022-03-17,"U.K. inflation was already running at a 30-year high prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The war has sent energy prices surging and will exert more upward pressure on the central bank's inflation projections.At its last meeting in February, the Monetary Policy Committee imposed back-to-back interest rate hikes for the first time since 2004.It upped its forecast for inflation to a 7.25% peak in April, against a backdrop of strong growth and a robust labor market in the U.K. LONDON — The Bank of England on Thursday raised interest rates for the third consecutive meeting but struck a more dovish tone as the Russia-Ukraine conflict is expected to keep inflation higher for longer.The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 in favor of a further 0.25 percentage point hike to its main Bank Rate, taking it to 0.75%.U.K. inflation was already running at a 30-year high prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which sent energy prices surging and will exert more upward pressure on the central bank's inflation projections.At its last meeting in February, the Monetary Policy Committee imposed back-to-back interest rate hikes for the first time since 2004 and upped its forecast for inflation to a 7.25% peak in April, against a backdrop of strong growth and a robust labor market in the U.K.The Bank said at the time that any further tightening of monetary policy would depend on the medium-term prospects for inflation, which were then propelled upward by Moscow's assault on Ukraine and subsequent threats to energy supply. ""Global inflationary pressures will strengthen considerably further over coming months, while growth in economies that are net energy importers, including the United Kingdom, is likely to slow,"" the Bank said in Thursday's report.The Bank now expects inflation to increase further in the coming months to around 8% in the second quarter of 2022, and perhaps even higher later in the year. Given the tightness of the labor market and persistent domestic cost and price pressures, the MPC also said that ""some further modest tightening in monetary policy may be appropriate in the coming months,"" though the risks are two-sided depending on the development of medium-term inflation prospects.Sterling retreated following the announcement, shedding 0.3% against the dollar, while the euro gained around 0.5% against the pound.Double-digit inflation 'not off the cards'Paul Craig, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said in reaction to the Bank's increased inflation projections that it now seems ""ultimately a double-digit inflation rate is not off the cards.""""The BoE had no choice but to keep raising rates. It is looking to build in some insurance now should there be a slowdown in economic growth or employment comes in worse than feared,"" Craig said.""With global risks and the Russia-Ukraine war having a significant economic impact, growth will be challenged and thus the Bank may need to reverse course later in the year.""For now though, Craig suggested the Bank will need to continue its tightening path to prevent a further devaluation of sterling, which would exacerbate the cost of living crisis gripping U.K. households.""Savings rates could improve from here which might offset some of the cost of living crunch, but with inflation proving difficult to contain it might all be a little too late,"" he added. Vivek Paul, U.K. chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, said the normalization of policy rates to their pre-pandemic levels and the end of quantitative easing made sense, with the country's strong economic rebound showing further stimulus is no longer necessary.The U.K. economy grew by 7.5% in 2021, clawing back much of its pandemic-era contraction.""Yet headwinds caused by the Ukraine war including sharply higher energy prices could slow the economy's momentum later this year,"" said Paul.""With market expectations yesterday for the base rate close to 2.2% by the end of the year – higher even than before the Ukraine war began – markets are betting that the Bank's rate path from here will be extremely aggressive in the near-term.""Although BlackRock does see more tightening over the coming years, Paul suggested that there is ""excessive hawkishness"" in most developed markets, since overly aggressive hiking from central banks would exact a heavy toll on growth.""Current market pricing points to a front-loading of rate hikes followed by a series of cuts, illustrating the risk of overtightening,"" said Paul.""Clear communication will be key, in our view, for the Bank to avoid creating confusion by over-tightening financial conditions and hurting the real economy."""

2022-03-18,"In late February, shortly after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, the Central Bank of Russia more than doubled the country's key interest rate from 9.5% to 20% in an effort to prop up its plunging currency.In its statement Friday, the CBR said the sharp increase in its key rate had ""helped sustain financial stability."" The Central Bank of Russia on Friday held its monetary policy steady and maintained its key interest rate at 20%, but warned of considerable uncertainty as the country's economy undergoes a ""large-scale structural transformation.""In late February, shortly after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, the CBR more than doubled the country's key interest rate from 9.5% to 20% in an effort to prop up its plunging currency and mitigate the impact of tough international sanctions.In its statement Friday, the CBR said the sharp increase in its key rate had ""helped sustain financial stability.""""The Russian economy is entering the phase of a large-scale structural transformation, which will be accompanied by a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation, mainly related to adjustments of relative prices across a wide range of goods and services,"" it said.""The Bank of Russia's monetary policy is set to enable a gradual adaptation of the economy to new conditions and a return of annual inflation to 4% in 2024."" The ruble sank to record lows against the dollar on the back of a barrage of new sanctions and penalties imposed on Moscow by the U.S. and European allies, before moderating in recent weeks. The currency sat at just over 104 to the dollar following the decision Friday.Earlier this week, Russia managed to stave off a historic debt default by completing some of its sovereign bond payments in dollars, Reuters reported. The Russian Finance Ministry said Friday that it had met its obligations to pay coupons on dollar-denominated eurobonds in full.The CBR's large quantities of foreign currency reserves were targeted by Western sanctions that aimed to render them almost inaccessible, preventing policymakers from mitigating the depreciation in domestic assets.Three takeawaysWhile the decision was expected, the central bank's statement gave some insight into how it views the economic outlook for Russia at present.William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said there were three key takeaways, the first of which was that the central bank seems to think it has done enough with last month's emergency hike to stabilize the financial system and prevent a run on Russian banks.""Second, the CBR sees sanctions and a shift by the Russian government towards autarky and isolationism as something that is here for the long haul,"" Jackson said, noting that the statement mentioned the ""large-scale structural transformation"" on several occasions. ""And third, despite that, policymakers at the CBR are trying to maintain a semblance of macroeconomic orthodoxy. The over-riding focus of the statement was on the balance of inflation risks and that monetary policy would remain tight to prevent second-round effects from the current inflation spike from taking hold.""This may indicate that policymakers aim to roll back the current capital controls, revert to a floating ruble and return the focus of monetary policy to inflation-targeting eventually, Jackson suggested."

The view was less optimistic than that of the previous meeting in January, when it said the economy was showing ""clearer signs of pick-up.""The central bank also warned of fresh risks from the Ukraine crisis, which it said was destabilizing financial markets and sharply pushing up raw material costs.""There is very high uncertainty on the impact developments in Ukraine could have on Japan's economy and prices via markets, raw material prices and overseas economies,"" the statement said. While inflation is seen approaching or even exceeding its 2% target in coming months, the BOJ is in no mood to withdraw stimulus as it sees the recent energy-driven price rise as transitory and a possible threat to an economy only just recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.The world's third-largest economy likely saw growth stall in the current quarter as supply disruptions and Covid-19 curbs hobbled output and consumption.At his post-meeting briefing, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is likely to stress his resolve to sustain huge monetary support until the rise in inflation is accompanied by strong wage growth.Earlier in the day, data showed Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.6% year-on-year in February, below the BOJ's target but marking the fastest pace in two years in a sign of growing inflationary pressure from higher energy costs. In a sign of the pain rising fuel costs is already inflicting on households, energy and electricity bills both shooting up by around 20% in February from year-before levels, the fastest pace since 1981."

China's trade surplus surged to historic highs during the pandemic as people consumed more goods than before, but analysts say the Russia-Ukraine war is set to change that.The Asian manufacturing giant's trade surplus could narrow to $238 billion this year – about 35% of the historic $676 billion attained last year, according to estimates from ANZ Research.""The war in Ukraine will soon start to weigh on net trade due to softer foreign demand and a higher import bill,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at research firm Capital Economics. The war could cause a broader slowdown in the global economy, especially in Europe, said ANZ Research senior China economist Betty Wang.The European Union is China's second-largest trading partner, accounting for about 15% of the Asian country's total exports. Exports to the EU jumped further last year, making up 16% of China's 30% exports growth, according to ANZ Research. ""Statistically, the EU's economic growth has a high correlation with China's total export growth,"" said Wang, adding that for every 1 percentage point drop in the EU's GDP growth, China's total export growth will fall by 0.3 percentage points. The shortage of semiconductors was already severe, but Russia's war in Ukraine is set to further disrupt supply chains.ANZ Research said the conflict has worsened the global shortage of chips, on which China is heavily reliant for its electronic exports. Exports of electronic items contributed 17.1 percentage points to China's 30% export growth in 2021, the research firm said.Analysts noted both Ukraine and Russia play important roles in global semiconductor supply chains.Ukraine supplies purified rare gases such as neon and krypton, both essential in making semiconductors, according to ANZ. It also produces precious metals used to make chips, smartphones and electric vehicles.China is among emerging markets vulnerable to commodity shortages caused by the war, according to a TS Lombard report published Monday. In particular, China is sensitive to disruptions in nickel supplies, the report said. Last week, the London Metal Exchange halted trading of nickel after prices more than doubled following supply disruption fears due to the war. Russia is the world's third-largest producer of nickel.Nickel is a key raw material in electric vehicle batteries and China is the largest EV producer globally. The number of EVs it exports to other countries jumped 2.6 times to nearly 500,000 last year – more than any other country in the world, Nikkei reported last week.China-made EVs accounted for about 44% of electric vehicles manufactured from 2010 to 2020, a study found. The Ukraine crisis has also led to volatile oil prices, which soared to record highs last week before tumbling more than 20%. That's set to hit China, the world's largest oil importer.

Several districts ordered residents to stay home and told businesses such as gyms to close.There was no specific order for steel mills.

2022-03-21,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell vowed tough action on inflation, which he said jeopardizes the recovery.Powell said the Fed will continue to hike rates until inflation comes under control, and could get even more aggressive than last week's increase, which was the first in more than three years.He noted those rate rises could go from the traditional 25 basis point moves to more aggressive 50 basis point increases if necessary. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday vowed tough action on inflation, which he said jeopardizes an otherwise strong economic recovery.""The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,"" the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for the National Association for Business Economics.The speech comes less than a week after the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years in an attempt to battle inflation that is running at its highest level in 40 years.Reiterating a position the Federal Open Market Committee made Wednesday in its post-meeting statement, Powell said interest rate hikes would continue until inflation is under control. He said the increases could be even higher if necessary than the quarter-percentage point move approved at the meeting.""We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability,"" he said. ""In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.""A basis point is equal to 0.01%. FOMC officials indicated that 25 basis point increases are likely at each of their remaining six meetings this year. However, markets are pricing in about a 50-50 chance the next hike, at the May meeting, could be 50 basis points.Stocks slipped to their lows of the session after Powell's remarks while Treasury yields rose. The sudden policy tightening comes with inflation as measured by the consumer price index running at 7.9% on a 12-month basis. A gauge that the Fed prefers still has prices up 5.2%, well above the central bank's 2% target.As he has before, Powell ascribed much of the pressures coming from Covid pandemic-specific factors, in particular escalated demand for goods over services that supply could not meet. He conceded that Fed officials and many economists ""widely underestimated"" how long those pressures would last.While those aggravating factors have persisted, the Fed and Congress provided more than $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus since the pandemic's start. Powell said he continues to believe that inflation will drift back to the Fed's target, but it's time for the historically easy policies to end.""It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain,"" said Powell, whose official title now is chairman pro tempore as he awaits Senate confirmation for a second term. ""In the meantime, as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.""Powell also addressed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying it is adding to supply chain and inflation pressures. Under normal circumstances, the Fed generally would look through those types of events and not alter policy. However, with the outcome unclear, he said policymakers have to be wary of the situation.""In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks,"" he said. ""However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have described.""Powell had indicated last week that the FOMC also is prepared to begin running off some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets on its balance sheet. He noted the process could begin as soon as May, but no firm decision has been made."
2022-03-21,"Oil prices are rising again, and there could continue to be big swings in both directions as the world deals with potential oil shortages.""The range of outcomes in any given two-week period is wide. We went from $90 to $130 per barrel in a month. We went from $125 to $95 in a week, and that is going to be the normal type of volatility,"" said one chief investment officer.Oil jumped 7% Monday as the European Union discusses sanctions on Russian oil and after Saudi Arabia facilities were attacked by Houthi rebels. Oil prices are racing higher again and are expected to see more sharp spikes and sudden dips as the world deals with potential supply shortages.For consumers, that means a longer period of expensive gasoline — with prices at the pump staying above $4 per gallon. For the economy, that means more inflation. Besides the strain on consumers, there will be higher costs across the board for any business relying on petroleum —  from airlines and truckers to chemical companies and plastics producers.Russia's invasion of Ukraine came at a time when oil prices were already moving higher on tight supplies and growing demand from reopening economies. Now, the loss of a big chunk of Russia's 5 million barrels a day of exports has put additional pressure on prices.""I remain constructive on oil because I do not see any immediate off ramp to the war in Ukraine. Market participants have been consistently giving Putin the benefit of the doubt on his professed willingness to negotiate, but we think we should pay attention to his actions not his words,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC.Oil jumped more than 7% Monday, as the European Union considers joining the U.S. in an oil embargo and after Saudi Aramco facilities were attacked over the weekend by Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen.  Analysts also acknowledge that there could be sudden collapses in the price, particularly if there were some resolution of Russia's attack on Ukraine.""The range of outcomes in any given two-week period is wide. We went from $90 to $130 per barrel in a month. We went from $125 to $95 in a week, and that is going to be the normal type of volatility. $10 a week is nothing, 10% moves nothing,"" said Daniel Pickering,  chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners.Pickering said the market was back to trading fear Monday.""You don't want to be taking higher price points off the tables in terms of possibility, but I think what we saw is there's the fear of something and right now it's the fear of actions around Russian barrels and that's going to create a lot of volatility,"" he said. ""If it turns into reality, I think you're biased higher from these levels. You put $130 back in play if we actually start canceling Russian barrels."" Pickering estimates that 2 million to 3 million barrels a day of waterborne Russian oil has been frozen out of the market, without immediate buyers. He said China and India are continuing to buy Russian crude. ""I'm sure on the margins there will be others willing to take more over time,"" he said.Pickering said he's not forecasting a return to $130 per barrel oil, but adds it could happen. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for April settled up 7% at $112.12 per barrel Monday.Francisco Blanch, Bank of America head of commodities and derivatives, said the U.S. market is set up for periodic price spikes.He said in a note, that limited production growth and strong refining and export demand are making for tight inventories at the U.S. Cushing storage facility in Oklahoma. That is a central oil facility for crude traded in U.S. futures contracts. The lack of storage there could make for more volatility in the futures market, since the holder of a futures contract must take physical delivery when the contract expires.In April 2020, that convergence led to a negative price for WTI oil as investors were forced to liquidate their positions at negative prices during a period of very low demand. Now, the opposite could cause price spikes during expiration, as investors try to buy, Blanch noted.The April contract expires Tuesday. ""Given the market is desperately short barrels in the near term, we see increased risk of a short squeeze as WTI moves towards expiry each month,"" said Blanch.European ban?The European Union is expected to discuss banning Russian crude, but there is disagreement among members. There are talks this week between EU governments and President Joe Biden in a series of summits aimed at hardening the response to Russia's invasion.""I think the prospect of either sanctions or an embargo on Russian oil in Europe is really increasing, and the pressure is going to grow over the week,"" said Dan Yergin, vice chair of IHS Markit.""But it needs to be done carefully and in careful consultation with the industry to minimize this disruption,"" said Yergin.Croft said she is skeptical Europe will go along with a ban. Europe is Russia's biggest export market for both oil and natural gas.""I still think Germany will block any EU effort to impose energy sanctions, so the economic lifeline provided to Putin by oil and gas sales will persist,"" said Croft.Russia's financial system has been sanctioned by the U.S. and allies, and the U.S. has banned Russian oil. Croft said more sanctions could be forthcoming.""The brutality of his military campaign will likely mean that the sanctions are here to stay for the foreseeable future and that Russia will remain a toxic asset,"" she said. ""I think we should pay closer attention to Congress because it could move to impose secondary sanctions which would essentially force Germany's hand on the issue.""Supply shortagesSaudi Arabia oil facilities were attacked over the weekend by Iranian-aligned Houthis. The missiles and drone attacks were fired at a water-desalination plant, a liquified natural gas plant, a power station and a gas facility. Aramco said there was no impact on supplies.""The Saudis are using this Houthi attack as a cover to say they absolve themselves from any oil market supply responsibility because of the attack,"" said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital. He noted Saudi's relations with the U.S. have been strained during the Biden administration.""The Saudi refusal to add supply is exacerbating the pricing issue for consumers around they're exacerbating the pricing issue for consumers around the world,"" said Kilduff.Saudi Arabia is a leading member of OPEC+, which includes other OPEC producers and Russia. The group agreed to return 400,000 barrels a day to the market each month until June. At its last meeting, OPEC+ did not signal whether it would consider adding any more barrels.Saudi Arabia has been silent on the invasion and has not promised to add any more oil to the market beyond its previous plans. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the kingdom last week, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also expected to visit.""Saudi Arabia remains resolute on sticking with OPEC+ easing formula. Boris Johnson returned to London empty handed and now with the stepped up Houthi attacks on energy infrastructure, the kingdom is warning that it may not be able to maintain current production levels,"" said Croft.Yergin said it would be difficult for Saudi Arabia to break from the OPEC+ partnership. ""The OPEC+ partnership was really a Saudi/Russian arrangement and before all this started it was a source of stability for the market,"" said Yergin. ""Ever since the price collapse of 2014, their goal had always been to bring Russia into an agreement rather than have Russia stand outside as a competitor. Their relationship has deepened and they've become strategic partners.""Yergin said the relationship was brought together at the highest levels — between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""If OPEC doesn't turn more barrels back on, the market's going to tighten up,"" said Pickering. ""I don't think they feel hugely compelled in the near term. I think there's a lot of gamesmanship going on ... I think there's a dynamic that says production from OPEC is going to continue to move higher, but not necessarily with the speed Europe and the U.S. would like.""Other supply sourcesThe U.S. has been looking for other sources of supply including possible barrels from Venezuela, which has been under sanctions.The market had been expecting a deal with Iran that would allow it to return more than 1 million barrels a day to the market in exchange for its agreement that it would end its nuclear program. But those talks have bogged down in recent weeks.U.S. producers could also bring back more oil, but their contributions are not expected to be much greater than the 900,000 to 1 million additional barrels a day already expected for this year.Some oil executives were meeting at the White House Monday.""I don't think the industry feels hugely compelled to jump into action. There's price volatility. There's a windfall profit tax discussion,"" said Pickering. ""We need to see if the government is going to provide any carrots. They've certainly provided sticks, but I don't think sticks will work.""Correction: Antony Blinken is the U.S. Secretary of State. An earlier version misspelled his name. "

2022-03-22,"Prices for raw materials that constitute the fertilizer market — ammonia, nitrogen, nitrates, phosphates, potash and sulphates — are up 30% since the turn of the year.Russia and Ukraine are among the most important producers of agricultural commodities in the world, with exportable supplies in global foodstuff and fertilizer markets concentrated in a small number of countries. LONDON — Supply shortages fueled by the Ukraine-Russia conflict, along with a host of pre-existing factors, have driven fertilizer prices to record highs.Prices for raw materials that constitute the fertilizer market — ammonia, nitrogen, nitrates, phosphates, potash and sulphates — are up 30% since the turn of the year and now exceed those seen during the food and energy crisis in 2008, according to British commodity consultancy CRU.Russia and Ukraine are among the most important producers of agricultural commodities in the world, with exportable supplies in global foodstuff and fertilizer markets concentrated in a small number of countries.In 2021, Russia was the world's top exporter of nitrogen fertilizers and the second-largest supplier of both potassic and phosphorous fertilizers, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.Trade between Russia and the rest of the world has not stopped, but has been severely disrupted as importers and vessel charterers steer clear of the country in light of the invasion of Ukraine, CRU Head of Fertilizers Chris Lawson said on Tuesday.Russia, which accounts for around 14% of global fertilizer exports, has temporarily suspended outgoing trade, which is expected to have a strong ripple effect across global food markets.""Furthermore, gas is a key input for fertilizer production. High gas prices have resulted in a curtailing of production in regions such as Europe, further constricting an already tight market,"" Lawson said. Meanwhile, sanctions on Russian-ally Belarus have substantial implications for the potash market, with Russia and Belarus contributing a combined 40% of annual traded volumes.""Since the beginning of 2020, nitrogen fertilizer prices have increased fourfold, while phosphate and potash prices over threefold,"" Lawson explained.""While farmers in developed markets have benefitted from high agricultural commodity prices, helping to partly offset high input prices, demand destruction is increasingly likely due to high prices and supply shortfalls.""Economies around the world are already dealing with historically high inflation driven largely by soaring food and energy prices. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Index shows food prices are at an all-time high, and Lawson suggested that a prolonged period of fertilizer shortage will affect longer-term farming yields.""Given the already tight grains and oilseeds market, and the importance of both Russia and Ukraine in those markets, food price inflation is an increasingly prominent risk,"" he added.Prior to the threat of reduced supplies from Russia and Belarus, fertilizer prices had already been facing upward pressure from global supply chain disruptions, a Chinese export ban and a Canadian rail strike.'More severe consequences'While much of the focus of discussions around price spikes in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been dominated by energy, the supply shock to fertilizer, wheat and other grains is expected to compound the problem.In a research note earlier this month, Barclays Chief U.K. and Senior European Economist Fabrice Montagné and Head of Economics Research Christian Keller suggested that ""the breadth and intensity of this supply shock could have more severe consequences than previous commodity price spikes, by broadening inflationary pressure.""""Food and fertiliser production have a high energy content owing to mechanisation, industrialisation and transport, but they also compete with other industries for raw inputs: the production of biofuel, for example, diverts crops away from agri-food while the production of lithium-ion batteries requires chemicals used in the production of P-fertiliser,"" they said.""Finally, renewed shipping and transportation difficulties and, more importantly, the impact of Russian sanctions on global supply are set to stretch global markets even further, akin to the 2008 global food crisis.""Global food prices increased sharply in 2007 and into the first quarter of 2008, triggering economic and political instability and social unrest across nations, both in developed and emerging economies. The impact, Barclays suggested, will be ""extremely asymmetrical"" with most emerging market economies disproportionately affected by food and fertilizer supply risks.However, that is not to say that developed economies and investors will not be affected, with punitive Russian and Western economic sanctions inevitably reducing supplies of energy, grain and fertilizer.In a note Friday, Wells Fargo Head of Global Real Assets John LaForge and Global Strategist Gary Schlossberg said given the weight of Russian supply, other countries will only be able to ""partially"" fill global supply gaps.Wells Fargo expects the food impact to be felt globally, becoming particularly troublesome for select emerging countries.""Overall, the current commodity wars, we believe, will lead to higher and more persistent inflation around the world, including in the U.S.,"" they said.""However, we think a U.S. recession is unlikely because low trade volumes with Russia should leave the U.S. in a comparatively stronger economic position."""

The U.S. has been ""extremely trigger-happy"" with stinging economic measures, and central banks may decide to diversify their portfolio of foreign reserves instead of relying heavily on the U.S. dollar, according to the co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security.""Central banks are beginning to ask questions,"" said Gal Luft of the Washington-based think tank, adding that they are wondering if reliance on the dollar and ""putting all their eggs in one basket"" is a smart idea.""The United States has extended itself, has been extremely trigger-happy when it comes to the use of sanctions and other economic punishments,"" he said.The White House did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.Luft said the U.S. took ""unacceptable and unheard of steps"" in recent weeks, such as effectively freezing Russia's central bank reserves and disconnecting Russia from the interbank messaging system, SWIFT. He said one in 10 countries in the world is under some form of U.S. sanctions. ""That has a cumulative effect and as a result, we see the dollar playing less and less of a role and portfolios of central banks,"" Luft said.His comments come after a Wall Street Journal report that Saudi Arabia is in accelerated talks with China to accept yuan instead of dollars for oil that Beijing buys.Oil is typically priced in U.S. dollars, and that has allowed Washington to run ""huge deficits,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Monday.Sanctions, however, make governments want to move away from the U.S. dollar, Luft said.He said the American political class has a ""lack of awareness"" about the consequences of their actions.""It's like a bunch of kids running around with guns shooting all over the place without realizing what they're actually doing, without looking at the cumulative impact of all of this,"" he said.""On the one hand, you are sanctioning right and left. On the other hand, you want countries to buy your Treasurys and finance your debt. That's not a sustainable scenario,"" he said. Separately, Luft, who is senior advisor to the U.S. Energy Security Council, discussed the uncertainty in global energy markets.""The overall picture is not good because what we're getting today is a heart attack on top of a heart attack,"" he said, pointing to the Covid pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, which could become ""very nasty.""""The combination of the two is really [a] double whammy,"" he said.Oil prices have fluctuated wildly over the past two years, plunging when the pandemic began and soaring when Russia invaded Ukraine in February.Luft said there is a realignment in the world's energy, financial and geopolitical systems, and the emergence of a ""new world order.""""The transition is never a happy one,"" he said. ""It's always painful, but that's the only way that the world can transform from one world order to another."""
2022-03-23,"Academics, Wall Street economists, market strategists and others seem to be flooding financial media with a series of ""I told you so's"" about inflation.Their primary argument suggests that the Federal Reserve and the federal government overstimulated the economy throughout the global pandemic, causing four-decade highs in inflation.They say that demand is outstripping supply because there's too much money chasing plenty of goods.Others have made similar arguments: that the world is experiencing a monetary inflation that has little to do with the supply chain disruptions that have plagued the economy for nearly two years and, instead, it's all about monetary and fiscal policies run amok.I understand the premise – but I disagree. Just two years ago, everyone was calling on policymakers to replace the lost income that disappeared during a lockdown that lasted far longer than anyone had expected and resulted in many dislocations in goods supply, labor supply and service sector activity.Some have claimed they've had the inflation argument right all along, yet I don't recall anyone accurately predicting the emergence of the Covid delta variant, which prolonged sheltering-in-place and remote work. Further, no one anticipated vaccine resistance and refusal, which added to the global and domestic death toll. Nor did anyone predict the lack of vaccines in some goods-producing nations.For good measure, let's add the emergence of the omicron variant, the near-permanent restructuring of labor supply and the renewed lockdowns in China and Hong Kong.Finally, not one ""inflationista"" made clarion calls about the impending war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions that exacerbated every pandemic and post-pandemic problem we've experienced so far in 2022.Those setbacks were most certainly not on my 2022 bingo card.As we've witnessed in the recent past, a whole world of financial observers laid the blame squarely on the Federal Reserve, despite its heroic efforts to put salve on a gaping economic wound when it was needed most quickly and acutely.Now, many are demanding the Fed rip the Band-Aid off, claiming that reducing normalized demand to meet constrained global supply is the answer to our problems.Of course, the Fed should be normalizing policy.But the hawks want the central bank to take back all its stimulus, virtually at once: a succession of half-point rate hikes and an immediate reduction of the Fed's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.These calls come just as the Biden administration has shifted its focus from the $1.75 trillion dollar ""Build Back Better"" budget to one that reportedly focuses on some sort of deficit reduction. Let's hit the brakes. The stock market might be enjoying a bit of a bear market bounce. This is predicated on the notion that an aggressive Fed will win the war on inflation — even though it didn't start it — and that the economy and corporate profits will grow strongly enough to offset between seven and 11 rate hikes in the next 15 to 18 months.In 38 years of covering financial markets and studying market history, I've never seen it — certainly not under circumstances like these.Meanwhile, a war is raging and may worsen before it gets better, as sanctions on Russia are getting tougher by the day.The inflation hawks, some of them housed at the Federal Reserve, may well be right for all the wrong reasons.That does not count as being correct.Many of them made the exact same argument after the Great Financial Crisis, and they were wrong for over a decade while still others altered their views with each data point that emerged.They may be right about inflation from a mechanical perspective, but given the persistence of supply shortages, labor disruptions, energy shocks and global instability, it's also quite possible they will soon be horribly wrong economically.The average American may well pay dearly for a pyrrhic philosophical victory that inflation was caused by the Fed.It's much more likely it was caused by the pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin.— Ron Insana is a CNBC contributor and a senior advisor at Schroders."
2022-03-23,"In Mark Zuckerberg's vision for the future, most forms of everyday work could require more imagination.On a recent episode of the ""Lex Fridman Podcast,"" hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, the Meta founder and CEO said that as modern technology continues to develop, tech-focused jobs will increasingly dominate the world — just not necessarily the types of ""tech jobs"" one might experience today.""Part of what I think is going to be great about the creative economy and the metaverse ... [is that] a lot more people in the future are going to get to work doing creative stuff than what I think today we would just consider traditional labor or service,"" Zuckerberg said.His prediction stems from personal experience: When he first launched Facebook in 2004, coding ""helped build something utilitarian,"" he said. Now, he added, he watches his daughter make ""code art,"" typing in equations to create visual, artistic expressions.The idea, Zuckerberg said, isn't that every future job will involve digital art. Rather, it's that the automation of some basic systems — which enables children to easily create art through code, for example — will allow people to spend more time on tasks like creating new products and making older processes more efficient.The concept itself isn't exactly new. For years, tech experts have predicted that artificial intelligence will eventually be able to replace humans in relatively mundane tasks, like compiling spreadsheets or writing basic code.With less time spent on tasks like gathering and organization data, people will theoretically be able to spend more time on analysis and brainstorming – which require a type of creative, critical thinking that artificial intelligence can't replicate.""These efficiency-boosting technologies are fantastic for eliminating the need for human engagement in time-consumer back-office tasks or physical heavy lifting – enabling humans to focus more on the intellectual heavy lifting,"" Ernst & Young global CTO Nicola Morini Bianzino wrote in a blog post last year.That shift may already be occurring: The Covid-19 pandemic expedited the implementation of robots into everyday life in toll booths, hospitals and dining halls across the country. In October 2020, the World Economic Forum predicted that data entry, secretarial, accounting, factory and mechanic jobs would likely be lost to machines by 2025.In total, according to the World Economic Forum's report, 85 million jobs could be eliminated within the next few years. But that number could be far outweighed by the report's estimated 97 million new roles created by emerging technology.Those jobs would largely be in fields like digital marketing, business development and data analysis — which tend to require creative and critical thinking skills, the report noted.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Check out this ‘insanely great’ offer letter Steve Jobs wrote to hire an employee – who now regrets turning him downMark Zuckerberg’s advice for young people: Focus more on building relationships than being ‘objective focused’"

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been in power for more than two decades and during that time has carefully cultivated an image of himself as a tough, strongman leader, fighting for Russia's interests and reinstating the country as a geopolitical and economic superpower.With his decision to invade neighboring Ukraine, however, analysts say Putin has made the biggest mistake of his political career and has weakened Russia for years to come.""Everything he has done up to this point [conferred] reputational damage to Russia, but it also enhanced power. And he just kept going and kept going and kept going,"" Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told CNBC.""But now he has actually dramatically weakened Russia, in every respect,"" he said, adding that he could not think of anything that Putin has done in his political career that's comparable.Global leaders are gathering in Europe on Thursday to discuss the war in Ukraine and how to help the country survive Russia's onslaught: An extraordinary NATO summit in Brussels, as well as meetings of EU leaders and the G-7.NATO is expected to commit to ""major increases"" in troop numbers along its eastern flank as well as more arms and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, although the military alliance has been reluctant to go further, fearing a direct confrontation with nuclear power Russia. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, ""President Putin has made a big mistake and that is to launch a war, to wage a war, against an independent sovereign nation.""""He has underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of the Ukrainian people and armed forces,"" Stoltenberg told CNBC's Hadley Gamble.NATO's plans to step up support for Ukraine, and deployments in Eastern Europe would allow it to respond to ""any threat, any challenge, to our security."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine has, in one month, prompted more than 3.5 million civilians to flee the country, with hundreds of thousands losing their homes in a relentless bombardment by Russian forces.The southern city of Mariupol has been the worst hit so far, with the port — a key export hub for Ukraine — still under siege and heavily destroyed.Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said there are around 100,000 civilians still trapped in the city, where water, food, electricity and medical supplies are scarce. Despite deploying near-constant shelling attacks and siege tactics in some areas, Russian forces have only captured one city — Kherson — and a much-feared assault on the capital Kyiv has yet to begin. In addition, the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, continues to resist Russian attacks and the western city of Lviv is currently relatively unscathed.The U.K. Defense Ministry said Wednesday that little had been gained by Russian forces, despite attempts to envelop Ukrainian troops in the east of the country. Read moreHow will Russia's war with Ukraine end? Here are 5 possible outcomes It's becoming clear to both Moscow and Kyiv that this war will not be easily won — and in the meantime, Putin has made Russia a pariah on the international stage.Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday that the U.S government believes Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine and should be prosecuted. In a statement, Blinken compared the destruction in Mariupol to similar Russian campaigns against Grozny in the Second Chechen War and Aleppo during the Syrian civil war.""Russia's forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded,"" he said. Russia has repeatedly said it does not target civilian infrastructure, despite much evidence to the contrary. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to the U.S. accusation that Russia has committed war crimes and is awaiting a reply. Under Putin's leadership — and until now — Russia's economy has prospered.Putin attracted much foreign direct investment to the country and exploited its natural resources, particularly its abundance of oil and gas, as well as trying to diversify the economy.During his tenure, however, Russia has also been hit by economic misfortunes both of its own making — such as international sanctions after its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, a nerve agent attack in the U.K. and its meddling in the 2016 U.S. election — and some it had no control over, such as the 2008 financial crisis, 2014 oil price crash and most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Read more5 charts show Russia's economic highs and lows under Putin Now, Russia's economic misfortunes are once again ones that Putin has brought upon the country himself with the invasion of Ukraine.The economy is already creaking under the weight of international sanctions and on Thursday, when U.S. President Joe Biden meets with European and NATO leaders in Brussels, even more sanctions could be imposed squeezing energy exporter Russia hard. The Institute of International Finance has said it expects Russia's economy to contract by 15% in 2022, driven by both official sanctions and the ""self-sanctioning"" of foreign companies that have pulled out of Russia.Predicting a further economic decline of 3% in 2023, the IIF said Wednesday that the war ""will wipe out fifteen years of economic growth."" Moreover, it said the impact on medium- and long-term prospects is likely to be even more severe, with a ""brain drain"" and low investment likely to weigh heavily. Despite making limited progress in his invasion so far, Putin appears undeterred.Russian forces are now believed to be conducting a period of reorganization before resuming large-scale offensive operations on and around Kyiv. Taras Kuzio, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, wrote in an article for the Atlantic Council on Tuesday that it is ""increasingly obvious that Russian President Vladimir Putin has badly miscalculated.""'He appears to have sincerely believed Kremlin propaganda fairytales about the weakness of the Ukrainian military and the readiness of ordinary Ukrainians to welcome his invading troops with cakes and flowers,"" Kuzio said, stating that Putin had drunk the Kremlin ""kool-aid.""In addition, Putin seems to have been unprepared for the ferocity of the international response or for the scale of domestic opposition to his invasion, Kuzio noted. ""Thanks to these catastrophic miscalculations, Putin now finds himself with no good options to end a war that is threatening to accelerate Russia's geopolitical decline as a great power."" Read morePutin’s obsession with Ukraine has made analysts question his rationality Russia has few friends left on the global stage, with the invasion almost universally condemned. Even Russia's ally China appears uneasy about the potentially prolonged conflict in Ukraine and its impact on the global economy.When the U.N. General Assembly met in early March, 141 countries adopted a resolution demanding that Russia immediately end its military operations in Ukraine. Only a handful of countries — a rogue's gallery of Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria, all of which are run by dictators — supported Russia's invasion. Russia's allies Cuba, Nicaragua and China abstained in the vote. Close watchers of Putin say there are increasing signs of desperation in Russia's military campaign and have questioned how far Putin will go to achieve his objectives.""There are deep mysteries about Russian intentions,"" Ian Lesser, vice president of the German Marshall Fund of the U.S., told CNBC earlier this month. ""How far will they go? What would they consider a victory?""""There are all sorts of possibilities, from a complete occupation of Ukraine, which I think most observers would say is not possible, to control over a couple of critical political centres in Ukraine, including Kyiv and possibly including Odesa, or perhaps they take have a larger territorial gambit in mind.""In such a scenario, he said Russia would be ""very exposed"" to an ongoing insurgency which also implies ongoing humanitarian costs. ""So there are large dilemmas here,"" Lesser added. Michal Baranowski, senior fellow and director of the German Marshall Fund's Warsaw office, told CNBC on Tuesday, that Putin has ""really overextended himself.""""We might be looking at the end of Russia as we have known it,"" he said.

""We don't see that happening at this point.""The Treasury secretary's remarks come as NATO leaders step up their efforts to warn China against enabling Russia's assault on Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies have for weeks warned Beijing that it would face severe consequences if it would aid Moscow by providing arms, offering alternative trade routes or creating disinformation campaigns.China has not fully denounced Russia's unprovoked attack on its neighbor, and like Russian President Vladimir Putin, has complained about NATO's expansion. U.S. officials have also said that Russia has asked China for military and economic assistance, a charge both countries deny.President Joe Biden last week threatened Chinese leader Xi Jinping with unspecified consequences if Beijing supports Moscow as it works to capture the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.While it is unclear how the White House would penalize China, it would likely call on the Treasury Department to expand its economic sanctions.In the interview, Yellen also touched on how both Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic have emphasized the importance of securing U.S. supply chains.""Maybe American businesses have focused on efficiency and organizing supply chains in ways that lower costs but impair resilience,"" she said.

So far, recession risks appear low.However, El-Erian said consumers are facing ""a cost-of-living crisis."" The Federal Reserve's efforts to fight inflation threaten to sink the U.S. into contraction, according to economist Mohamed El-Erian.Following the U.S. central bank's decision earlier this month to increase interest rates for the first time in more than three years, markets now expect the Fed to get even more aggressive.Current pricing suggests a half percentage-point hike in May and a cumulative boost of 2.5 percentage points to benchmark rates through the end of the year, from the near-zero level where they started 2022.Doing that could take a big toll on U.S. growth, said El-Erian, chief economist advisor at Allianz and president of Queens' College, Cambridge.""The bond market believes inflation is too high, the Fed is well behind the curve, and the Fed risks ... pushing the economy into recession as it tries to catch up,"" El-Erian told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in a Monday morning interview. Indeed, some market measures are indicating that recession risks are building.Some shorter-term government bond yields are running higher then their longer-duration counterparts, historically a warning sign that investors believe economic growth ahead will slow. For instance, the 3-year Treasury note was running ahead of both the 10-year note and 30-year bond in Monday trading.However, a more reliable indicator has been the relationship between the 10-year and the 3-month note, and that yield curve is well apart. The spread between those yields at the end of last week was still about 1.93 percentage points, a margin that implied only a small chance of recession over the next year.Still, El-Erian said consumers will be struggling with inflation in the coming months. The Fed will try to contain inflation with rate hikes that could constrict economic growth.""We are looking at a cost-of-living crisis. That's what we are looking at for the next two quarters, three quarters, where the consumer is going to be hit hard by inflation, they're gonna get hit hard by lower consumer sentiment,"" he said.El-Erian noted that U.S. stocks have held up relatively well so far, as there are still few alternatives for investors. A slew of data points this week will help shed light on how quickly the Fed needs to move.The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for February, due Tuesday, will give insight on labor market slack. The previous month's report indicated a gap of about 4.8 million between job openings and unemployed potential workers.On Thursday, the Commerce Department will release the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index. That is expected to show a 12-month gain of 5.5% in February, above the previous month's 5.2% and well ahead of the Fed's 2% goal.Then on Friday, the March nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show a 5.5% 12-month increase in average hourly earnings. Economists fear a wage-price spiral that could exacerbate the current 7.9% inflation pace, which is the highest in 40 years.Consumers flush with cash from pandemic-related stimulus programs have been able to absorb much of the higher costs. But El-Erian said inflation and higher rates will take a toll.""The corporate sector has pricing power. It has pricing power because demand is still solid. So we'll be able to pass through the higher costs,"" he said. ""Overall, we are gonna go through a difficult period where the cost of living is going to be on everybody's mind."""
2022-03-28,"Wall Street may be overestimating recession risks.While investors focus on an unnerving inversion between the five-year and 30-year Treasury Note yields, Canaccord Genuity's Tony Dwyer is concentrating on optimistic activity in another part of the bond market.According to Dwyer, the three-month versus five-year yield shows a healthier picture of the U.S. economy because it steepened.""It measures the difference between what a banker lending institution gets its money at, what they have to pay, versus what they charge or invested at,"" the firm's chief market strategist told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Monday. ""We don't look for a recession because of that yield curve that's driving the lending is still very positive.""Dwyer acknowledges the overall bond market is reflecting economic challenges — but not enough to spark a recession.""The fear is definitely there. Asia seems to be a mess with more lockdowns. Europe is heading toward a recession, if not in one because of the once in a generation ground war there,"" he said. ""The U.S. is being affected by higher rates. So, it certainly is slowing down.""Dwyer expects the Federal Reserve to continue raising rates over the next few months.""There's no question inflation is high. Rates are going higher,"" Dwyer said. ""The Fed is in a box. No matter the slowdown, they've got to raise rates.""He sees stocks as a hedge against inflation and plans to buy around weakness. Based on historical trends during similar backdrops, Dwyer believes the S&P 500 will be significantly higher this time next year.But for now investors may want to brace themselves for wild market swings. ""We call it tumultuous,"" said Dwyer, who believes volatility is an opportunity.He lists interest rate sensitive plays Big Tech and utilities as his best contrarian ideas. Dwyer predicts the slowing economy will provide some inflation relief in the year's second half and put Fed rate hikes on pause.""The market seems to be almost pricing in a recession trade because the areas that should do the best with higher rates have been lagging,"" Dwyer said.The S&P 500 closed at 4,575.52 on Monday and is off 4% so far this year.Disclaimer"

Failure to address energy affordability risks casting significant portions of the world into poverty and stagnating the global economy, according to the United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei.Soaring energy prices have caused inflation to spike around the world and triggered cost of living crises across both developed and emerging economies.Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday at the World Government Summit in Dubai, UAE, Al Mazrouei voiced concern that the global focus on geopolitics and energy security was leading governments to overlook the long-term implications of declining affordability.He said leaders of the OPEC+ organization of oil-exporting countries were trying to maintain order and bring resources to the market at a manageable pace but suggested this was becoming increasingly difficult.""For that to happen, we need resources – financial resources – we need to invest and we need to decouple politics from energy availability and energy affordability,"" Al Mazrouei said.""I'm worried that because we are mixing the two, we could end up in a situation where energy affordability becomes an issue and that would definitely lead ultimately to poverty, and ultimately could lead to a stagnation of the world economy. We are trying, but we cannot be blamed for everything – we are doing our best."" Oil and gas prices have surged since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but Al Mazrouei noted that the focus previously had been on sustainability and the energy transition, which combined with a demand slump due to the Covid-19 pandemic, caused prices to slump to historic lows in 2020.OPEC+ at the time responded with record production cuts, but Al Mazrouei said the next issue to address beyond securing supply would be securing affordability.""I am sure the next is going to be energy affordability and resources, in that sense, because food security is becoming an issue and industrial commodities or minerals are becoming an issue as well,"" he said.""So the risk I see, or the danger, is poverty which could lead to people having to go and join those terrorist groups."""
2022-03-29,"Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Tuesday that he doesn't think the U.S. is heading for recession.His comments come despite fears over an inversion of 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields that has been a harbinger of previous downturns.Harker said he remains open to the idea of more aggressive rate hikes ahead but favors moving by a quarter-percentage point in May. Despite on ominous indicator hanging over the economy and higher interest rates on the way, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said Tuesday that he doesn't think the U.S. is heading for recession.That view, expressed in a CNBC interview, comes in the face of a looming inversion of the 10- and 2-year Treasury yields and market expectations that the Fed is about to embark on a substantial rate-hiking cycle aimed at curbing inflation.Harker said he thinks the current state of the economy is strong enough to withstand both tighter monetary policy and bond market fears of what that will mean to growth.""What I'm looking for is a safe landing,"" he told CNBC's Sara Eisen during a ""Power Lunch"" interview. ""It may be bumpy along the way. It was bumpy going up, it's going to be bumpy coming down. We've all been on those planes. We land safely, but it would be a bit of a thrill ride. I don't want that. So that's why we're being cautious and careful about how we implement policy.""The comments came with the curve about flat between the benchmark 10-year and its 2-year counterpart. The curve has inverted, with the 2-year yield above the 10-year, in most recent U.S. recessions, though it has not been a guarantee.Harker cautioned against relying too much on one relationship when trying to predict the future.""The evidence is mixed. If you look at the data, it clearly correlates with recessions. But causation is not very clear,"" he said. ""So we need to make sure that we're looking at lots of different data.""Yield curve inversions are considered an important sign as they reflect investor fear that the Fed will tighten conditions too much so that they restrict further growth. They also tend to inhibit lending from banks who worry that future returns will be lower.However, U.S. unemployment is back to near where it was pre-pandemic, when the jobless rate hit a 50-year low. Consumers remain flush with cash and property values continue to rise.But the Fed has been wrestling with inflation levels running at a 40-year high, prompting Harker and his colleagues to embark on a rate-hiking cycle in which markets expect increases at each of the remaining six meetings this year, with possibly as high as half a percentage point.Harker said he thinks the Fed at its May meeting should increase its benchmark rate by only a quarter-percentage point, or 25 basis points. Markets, though, are expecting a hike of 50 basis points, and Harker said he remains open to the idea depending on the data.""I wouldn't take it off the table,"" he said of the higher move.Even with the prospect of much higher rates, he said he thinks the Fed can engineer its way through the current situation, with a focus on bringing down inflation first.""That's job one,"" he said. ""I don't want to overdo it, though, and try to just stomp the brakes hard and have growth end.""""I think it will be a bumpy ride, and there may be some problems where we get into a period of below-trend growth for a while,"" he added. ""But I think we can pull this off."""
2022-03-29,"The latest reading from the University of Michigan's consumer survey finds that the percentage of Americans who expect their personal finances to be worse in a year has reached its highest level since the mid-1940s.There are growing concerns, and some signs, that grocery shoppers will ""trade down"" on the shelf in the months ahead.So far, wage increases and job market confidence, high savings rates helped by Covid stimulus, and higher-income consumers who make up the majority of spending, are keeping the economy strong. A big question on the minds of both Wall Street and C-suites across corporate America is the strength of the consumer, namely, how long can it last?At some point, consumers will begin to balk at higher prices brought on by demand shocks, supply chain disruptions and surging energy prices. But they have not yet. So far, companies have been able to pass along higher costs, and consumers have been willing to pay. Higher wages, job market confidence, and the historically high rate of savings among Americans that has yet to be fully tapped are all contributing to present economic strength.The latest data from early earnings reports is encouraging. Last week, General Mills' quarterly results showed no sign of consumers looking to ""trade down"" on the supermarket shelf.""If General Mills is any indication, all is good,"" said Stifel analyst Chris Growe. ""I don't want to exaggerate, but their performance this past quarter was strong, in relation to expectations, and their guidance was even better.""Double digit pricing increases in its most recent quarter, along with cost savings, will more than offset inflation for the company, according to Stifel's analysis.""There is so much pricing coming through (up nearly 11% in the month of February for our large-cap food companies) that it will actually be sufficient to offset inflation,"" Growe said. ""There is an increasing degree of confidence in the relatively near-term around this pricing/cost balance taking hold.""But how long this situation lasts as a good one for both bottom lines and pocketbooks is on Wall Street's mind. Inflation is not backing down, so getting pricing up is just keeping gross profit dollars flat for most companies. And Stifel is finding in its recent survey data more consumer concern about grocery prices. ""That could lead to greater levels of elasticity for the branded food products. With private label products on average roughly 35%-40% below the price of branded food we could start to see some trade down activity,"" Growe said. It hasn't happened yet, but CFOs of major corporations tell CNBC it is a factor to monitor into the second half of 2022.""It could start to happen in the coming months and higher elasticity could slow that benefit from all of the pricing,"" Growe said.Elasticity, a measure of the relationship between movement in price and consumer demand, has broken with history this year. But it's safe to say the consumer is on edge.Last Friday's University of Michigan Survey of Consumers for March found that expectations among Americans that their personal finances would worsen in the year ahead grew by the largest proportion since the survey started in the mid-1940s. Half of all households anticipate a decline in inflation-adjusted incomes in the year ahead. Inflation was a big part of the story, with more consumers mentioning reduced living standards due to rising inflation than any other time except during the two worst recessions in the past 50 years: from March 1979 to April 1981 and from May to October 2008.Nevertheless, University of Michigan survey director Ricard Curtin says the consumer remains strong, with confidence in the rising wages and employment opportunities — over 4 million Americans quit their jobs in February — likely to sustain moderate spending growth for the foreseeable future. What's more, the stimulus packages that led to elevated savings continue to bolster the spending power of upper income households, even if lower-income consumers have less firepower.The Conference Board's latest monthly confidence index reading on Tuesday showed this gap between the present and future, with present confidence slightly higher in March and up for the first time this year, a sign the economy remains strong, but expectations dipping again, with consumers citing rising prices, including gas prices.Gallup's latest survey of Americans out on Tuesday morning found roughly one in five Americans (17%) saying the high cost of living, or inflation, was the most important problem for the nation. The high-income consumer is key, notes Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, with the one-third of upper income bracket consumers representing 75% of all spending in the U.S. economy. ""If the high income consumers are out buying, we won't see a big impact on raw consumer activity,"" Zandi said.For low-income households — by some estimates, over 60% of U.S. households are living paycheck to paycheck — high gas prices haven't hit yet because they came into this cost of living change with excess savings and have been getting strong wage increases on top of that. ""They are living paycheck to paycheck, but have not had to pull back on spending yet, but that is coming,"" Zandi said. Between the higher gas prices and excess savings starting to get paid down, Moody's expects lower-income consumers to start being more cautious this spring.A third of all consumers in the Michigan survey spontaneously mentioned that inflation has reduced their living standards already, and gas prices and food prices are the two most frequent purchases of consumers. As those prices go up, the pain will increase, Curtin said. But so far, ""consumers are saying if 'I don't buy now, it will only cost more later.' So you have anticipatory buying and that is a self-generating cycle,"" he added. While the Russia-Ukraine war is a wildcard inflation factor for both food and energy, he said the data suggests there is a good chance companies can pass through costs for the rest of year and consumers will be receptive.Consumer sentiment readings are not a perfect tell, either, given the pandemic era angst, now combined with inflation and a war in Europe. But even if sentiment is swayed by these factors — as well as politics, which Curtin said has been rising as a partisan divide in the data — the recent data show that consumer sentiment is fragile.""Look to the discretionary items and spending on meat, steak, start to come down, or you start to see less dining out at restaurants that cater to lower- and middle-income households, the chain restaurants,"" Zandi said. ""When they are trading down in various consumer items, that's the real tell.""  Zandi is also watching the cracks in the housing market that are already becoming evident in pending home sales and existing home sales rolling over. ""We would expect housing price growth will hit the wall pretty soon, and we may even see some weakening in prices, not next month, but certainly by this time next year,"" Zandi said.Housing market prices have been strong, and this is key because not only is housing the most rate-sensitive sector of the economy, and already showing signs of stress as mortgage rates rise, but the damage that is inevitable is a key to how the U.S. consumer feels about their overall finances. When people buy and sell homes they make a lot of other purchases too, from cars to furniture to home improvement, and it drives a lot of additional consumer activity. ""The ripple effects will be significant, and the other link is house prices and people feeling they have equity, feeling better about borrowing against cards,"" Zandi said. ""It just doesn't feel like that can continue. It feels tenuous.""Michigan's survey of consumer expectations has a long track record of forecasting recessions throughout the post-World War II period. It falls in advance of an economic downturn, on average six months to a year ahead, and it is falling now. ""We are in for a difficult time,"" Curtin said."

A key signal of recession flashed in the bond market this week, but SkyBridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci told CNBC that he would be cautious on predicting there would be a downturn.On Monday, the U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasury yields inverted for the first time since 2006. On Tuesday, the yield spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate came close to inverting but stayed positive.Historically, the yield curve has inverted prior to recessions, indicating investors' concern about the health of the economy.""So historically it would signal that we're heading into a recession 12 to 18 months from now, but I will be cautious on that data,"" Scaramucci said on CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Wednesday.When the bond market is healthy, yields are higher for bonds with a longer time to maturity, and lower for short-term yields. Investors expect a bigger reward for lending their money for a longer time.But when the opposite occurs — meaning an inverted yield curve — short-term bonds pay a higher yield than long-term ones. That represents a distortion in the market and suggests bond investors are worried about the economy's long-term prospects.Scaramucci explained why he wouldn't be too hasty to predict a recession.""You've got two conflicting things happening at the same time — the ending of the pandemic or at least the lockdown procedures in most of the world. And you've got the uncertainty about a cease-fire, potentially, in Ukraine and Russia,"" the hedge fund founder said.""And I think that, that has to abate before we can really look at and analyze the data and determine whether or not it's consistent with the historical guidance and the indication of recession,"" he added.But Scaramucci said he's ""not quite convinced that there'll be a recession,"" adding that the ""economy is booming around the world.""""So for me, I want to be cautious and I'm still very optimistic about the U.S. economy specifically and the overall stock market,"" he said.

Russian oligarch wealth is on the hunt for a new home, and Turkey is quickly establishing itself as a welcome host.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNBC Saturday that he'd welcome sanctioned Russian oligarchs into the country as both tourists and investors, as long as their business dealings adhered to international law.It came a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that ""certain capital groups"" could ""park their facilities with us,"" in what was seen as a direct reference to the recent arrival of several Russian-owned luxury assets in Turkey, including two luxury yachts and a private jet belonging to billionaire Roman Abramovich.The comments have sparked speculation that Turkey — a non-EU country but a NATO member — may be actively encouraging investment from blacklisted billionaires as it seeks to shore up its embattled economy. Already, wealthy Russians are actively seeking investments there, according to Reuters reports.But any prospective gains could be short-sighted for a country orchestrating a delicate balancing act between Russia and the West.""Attracting Russian money could hurt Turkey in the long-term,"" Defne Arslan, a senior director at the Atlantic Council in Turkey and former economist for the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, told CNBC. Turkey is seeking to tread a fine line in the ongoing war in Ukraine.While strongly criticizing Moscow's unprovoked invasion, it has stopped short of implementing sanctions like those imposed by the U.S., EU, U.K. and others, saying it opposes them on principle.Instead, it has adopted the role of a neutral mediator, facilitating peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Negotiations in Istanbul on Tuesday appeared to raise hopes of a breakthrough after Moscow agreed to cut its military assault on Kyiv and Chernihiv, while Ukrainian negotiators proposed adopting neutral status in exchange for security guarantees. Turkey's stance of nominal neutrality is largely understood given its close economic and diplomatic ties with Russia, particularly regarding energy, defense, trade and tourism. As such, Western allies have not pressured Turkey to join sanctions, nor are they likely to punish it for not doing so.That makes it a legitimate outpost for assets belonging to sanctioned Russians. Indeed, an influx of foreign investment and luxury assets could provide a boon for the beleaguered Turkish economy, which slipped into crisis mode last September as unorthodox interest rate cuts pushed already spiraling inflation higher.However, Western tolerance is likely to wane should Turkey begin actively soliciting sanctioned wealth, according to Emre Peker, director and Turkey specialist at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. ""If they're parking their yacht, that's OK,"" Peker said. ""But Ankara will be very cognizant about Turkey becoming grounds for sanctions-busting and will be careful to prevent that.""The Turkish Embassy in London did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Turkey can scarcely afford to be hit with secondary sanctions given the pressure that the war and resultant Russian sanctions have already inflicted on its economy.Last month, inflation soared to a 20-year high of 54.4% amid a crash in the lira and soaring commodity prices. Data fully reflecting the impact of the war are yet to be released.""Russia's attack on Ukraine is making Turkey's economic situation more precarious,"" Peker said.""The ramifications are clear,"" he continued. ""Inflationary pressures are higher, destabilizing the Turkish economy. The fallout of sanctions will curtail or halt tourism from Russia and Ukraine, which accounted for about one-third of inbound tourism. And it will affect Turkish investment into Ukraine and Russia.""Meantime, Erdogan is keen to uphold Turkey's reputation as an independent mediator in the ongoing conflict, seeking to win favor both at home and abroad ahead of elections in 2023.""Erdogan is desperate to get through to the elections next year,"" Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, told CNBC. Still, there are opportunities for Turkey to shore up its economy and benefit from the movement of wealth from Russia without drawing political and economic ire.That includes attracting investment from some of the 450 Western brands that have so far withdrawn from Russia, according to the Atlantic Council's Arslan.""If it plays it right, I think it can be a huge opportunity for Turkey, not only staying in line with Western allies but potentially attracting investment from foreign companies,"" she said, highlighting the similarities between Russian and Turkish geography and production lines among other factors.Indeed, Erdogan said last week that Turkey's ""door is open"" to companies looking to relocate their business outside of Russia.""Not only American companies, but also many brands and groups from around the world are leaving Russia. Of course, our door is open to those who come to our country,"" he said."

""What that's telling me is people want to be working, and that's a little bit of a different shift. People were going for more money, and they were going for work from home.""Gimbel said now companies are hiring for a hybrid structure, with employees still at home part-time but more often in the office. ""We still have companies that are willing to pay for the experienced talent and the wages continue to increase...You're getting people that are two-years experienced, and they're getting what two or three years ago they would have gotten with five years' experience,"" he said. ""We're seeing out-of-college salaries really start to balloon.""Gimbel said for instance, a young professional in consulting may have initially earned $55,000 to $60,000 several years ago, and now could see a salary offer of $75,000 to $90,000. ""It's just that companies are in such short supply of people to do the work,"" he said. In February, total nonfarm employment was still down 2.1 million, or 1.4% from its prepandemic level in February 2020. The participation rate was 62.3% in last month, down from 63.4% in February 2020.Zandi said the economy still has room to create jobs before reaching full employment. The Federal Reserve has already determined the job market is strong enough for it to turn its focus on fighting inflation.The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point this month, its first hike since 2018, and economists are predicting it could ramp up the pace even more to a 50 basis point, or half-point increase in May. The Fed forecast the equivalent of seven quarter-point rate hikes for this year.That makes the wage component of the employment report an important focus for markets that have been fixated on inflation.""I'm expecting a 0.4% increase"" in average hourly wages, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. ""That will give us 5.5% on the year, which puts us back at January levels. They slowed a bit in February so we'll see a reacceleration in wage growth.""The hotter wages are filtering into inflation. The consumer price index jumped 7.9% in February and is expected to be high again in March.""Even though wages are not going up as fast as inflation, there's no question wage gains are adding to goods inflation and services inflation,"" Swonk said. ""We're starting to see it show up in the service sector.""Regardless of what is in the employment report, the Fed is expected to proceed with its interest rate hike in May.""Clearly the Fed has already decided that we're overheating,"" said Swonk. ""This is a remarkably fast gain in jobs, but it's faster than the economy can accommodate. If everyone is running at the door at once, people get crushed.""State Street's Loh said the March jobs report is not likely to have much market impact.""From a market perspective, unless it's a massive surprise to the downside, it's not going to have a big effect,"" he said. ""The jobs market is fully healed from the Fed's perspective... They've already signaled that we're at full employment from a monetary perspective.""But Loh also said the jobs market could overheat if the participation rate doesn't improve, which means the number of people actually working in the economy doesn't expand.""If we actually end up printing these kind of numbers without people coming back into the workforce, we could collapse that unemployment rate pretty quickly, and that would be a sign of overheating,"" he said."
2022-03-31,"Both resignations and job openings were near record highs in February, and the layoff rate was near a historic low.Employer demand for workers remains high and is fueling the trend known as the Great Resignation.However, demand may cool in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and if the war in Ukraine weighs on the U.S. economy. The pandemic-era trend known as the ""Great Resignation"" remains a prominent feature of the labor market, as favorable conditions lead workers to quit their jobs at near-record levels in search of better (and ample) opportunities elsewhere.Nearly 4.4 million Americans quit their jobs in February, the U.S. Department of Labor said Tuesday.That's about 100,000 more people than quit in January, and just shy of the 4.5 million record set in November. ""These quits are still extremely high, and that shows the Great Resignation is still in full swing,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at the career site Glassdoor.The high demand for workers shows little sign of abating but may have plateaued, he added.""It wouldn't be a surprise to see that cool down in 2022,"" Zhao said. ""But that's not to say we should expect the Great Resignation to disappear overnight."" Resignations, or ""quits"" — which are generally voluntary separations initiated by workers — serve as a measure of employees' willingness or ability to leave jobs, according to the Labor Department.Job openings, like resignations, have also lingered near record highs, helping fuel workers' confidence in finding new gigs elsewhere.There were 11.3 million job openings in February — essentially unchanged from January and down slightly from December's record of more than 11.4 million.Job openings reflect employer demand for workers and tend to move up and down with resignations, Zhao said.The layoff rate — a measure of layoffs relative to the overall level of employment — also remains near historic lows, at 0.9% in February.

It hadn't previously touched 1% since record keeping started in 2000.Meanwhile, 202,000 people filed a new claim for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That trend is below the historical average, said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.8% in February, its lowest level since February 2020. The Labor Department is issuing its March jobs report on Friday. These data points — ""quits,"" job openings, layoffs and benefits — reflect a job market that's been strong for workers.Employer demand for labor picked up steam in the spring and early summer 2021, as Covid-19 vaccines started rolling out broadly in the U.S. and the economy began emerging from its pandemic hibernation.That high demand has outpaced the ready supply of workers, and businesses have raised wages at their fastest clip in years to compete for talent. Others have expanded their hiring pool.  ""There is a brutal battle for lower-skilled employees occurring,"" Ron Hetrick, senior economist at Emsi Burning Glass, a job market analytics firm, said. ""Companies that usually require college degrees are starting to drop those requirements, meaning they're now entering into the fray to find the same worker that other companies have trouble hiring.""Most people who quit are switching jobs rather than leaving the labor force altogether, according to Nick Bunker, an economist at job site Indeed. The number of people hired in February exceeded resignations by about 2.3 million people, the Labor Department said. However, there are signs the Great Resignation trend may have topped out at the end of 2021. Resignations and job openings seem to be plateauing, a sign that employer demand may wane throughout 2022, Zhao said.The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, started raising its benchmark interest rate in March (which will raise borrowing costs for companies and households). The Fed is aiming to cool off the economy and rein in inflation, which is running at a 40-year high. The war in Ukraine may also have dampening effect on the economy.""It's possible that with the benefit of hindsight, we'll say December 2021 was the peak of employer demand in this cycle, before rate hikes, geopolitical uncertainty and other risk factors slowed the economy,"" Zhao said.""[But] as long as employer demand remains high, I fully expect the Great Resignation to continue,"" he added."

2022-04-01,"As Covid restrictions eased, rebounds in the leisure and hospitality and business sectors continued last month and helped to drive a strong March jobs report.The March 2022 jobs report showed that the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes hotels, restaurants and amusement parks, added a net 112,000 jobs.The broad health and social services sector added more than 30,000 in March 2022 thanks to hiring for social services workers, which include child-care staff.  As Covid restrictions eased, rebounds in the leisure and hospitality and business sectors helped to drive a strong March jobs report.The U.S. economy added more than 400,000 jobs in the final month of the first quarter, the Labor Department said Friday.Leisure and hospitality, which includes hotels, restaurants and amusement parks, added a net 112,000 jobs in the third month of 2022. Within the industry, restaurants and bars added 61,000 jobs, hotels and other lodging businesses tacked on 25,000 and amusement, gambling and other recreation climbed 16,400.The industry, one of the hardest-hit during the worst of Covid-19 and government business shutdowns, has posted 15 straight months of net job gains of at least 100,000. Still, employment in leisure and hospitality has fallen by 1.5 million, or 8.7%, since February 2020.The wide-ranging professional and business services sector also posted a robust March with a net addition of 102,000 positions. Accountants and other bookkeeping staff had a particularly strong month, with a climb of 18,000.Computer system designers and management consultants, both of which fall under business services, added 12,300 and 15,100 jobs, respectively. Building services employees, including pest control and landscaping workers, added 22,100.A top economic advisor to the White House welcomed the March report and said that the print underscores the ""incredible resilience"" of the labor market as it recovers from the pandemic.""We're seeing about 560,000 jobs a month over the last quarter, and that's been consistent over the last year,"" Brian Deese, the director of President Joe Biden's National Economic Council, told ""Squawk on the Street"" following the report.""Importantly, we're seeing that in broad breadth. And, of course, we're seeing the unemployment rate now down to 3.6%,"" he added. ""There's only been three months in the last 50 years that the United States has had an unemployment rate lower than 3.6%.""Retail had a decent month with a gain of 49,000, thanks to healthy hiring at grocery stores (+17,800) and warehouse clubs and supercenters (+21,400). Gas station employment rose by nearly 3,000, and motor vehicle and parts dealers added 5,100 to payrolls.Stores that sell furniture, electronics and building materials all saw minimal losses.Transportation and warehousing, an industry scrutinized for potential supply chain relief, saw little change over the month, with a loss of 500 jobs. Within the sector, couriers and messengers that deliver mail and packages added 6,700 jobs while truck transportation shed almost 5,000 workers.The broad health and social services sector added more than 30,000 to payrolls, thanks in large part to unusual hiring for social services workers, which include child-care workers, community food and housing staff and vocational rehabilitation employees.Social assistance alone added 25,000 jobs last month on top of February's gain of 30,400.

2022-04-01,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is announcing it will boost fuel efficiency requirements by 8% for both the 2024 and 2025 model years and 10% in 2026. The new rules are expected to reduce consumer fuel costs by $192 billion for new vehicles sold by 2030. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December finalized its stricter vehicle emissions requirements that are parallel to the NHTSA rules. President Joe Biden's administration on Friday unveiled tougher fuel economy standards for vehicles reversing his predecessor Donald Trump's rollback of U.S. regulations aimed at improving gas mileage and cutting tailpipe pollution.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is announcing it will boost fuel efficiency requirements by 8% for both the 2024 and 2025 model years and 10% in 2026. That's slightly more aggressive than the agency's proposal outlined in August.The new rules are expected to reduce consumer fuel costs by $192 billion for new vehicles sold by 2030. The administration is eager to make the case that regulatory rules will prod automakers into building more efficient and save consumers money at a time of near record gas prices.The rules will be challenging for automakers to meet, which will need to spend billions to make more efficient models. Under Trump, the government in March 2020 rolled back fuel economy standards that had been set under his predecessor Barack Obama to require only 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. Obama had required 5% annual increases.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December finalized its stricter vehicle emissions requirements that are parallel to the NHTSA rules. The EPA said its rules will result in 3.1 billion tons of avoided CO2 emissions through 2050. Major automakers on Wednesday backed the EPA's revisions over challenges brought by some states and some ethanol groups.The EPA rules would result in a fleetwide real-world average of about 40 miles per gallon in 2026 compared with 32 mpg under the Trump rules. The NHTSA rules result in about the same in real-world figures.NHTSA on Sunday said it reinstated a sharp increase in penalties for automakers whose vehicles do not meet fuel efficiency requirements for model years 2019 and beyond. The decision was a victory for Tesla that could cost other automakers like Chrysler-parent Stellantis hundreds of millions of dollars or more."
2022-04-04,"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon identified three forces that are likely to shape the world over the next several decades: a U.S. economy rebounding from the Covid pandemic; high inflation that will usher in an era of rising rates, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian crisis.  ""They present completely different circumstances than what we've experienced in the past – and their confluence may dramatically increase the risks ahead,"" he wrote.""The war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia, at a minimum, will slow the global economy — and it could easily get worse,"" Dimon wrote. That's because of the uncertainty about how the conflict will conclude and its impact on supply chains, especially for those involving energy supplies. Jamie Dimon, CEO and chairman of the biggest U.S. bank by assets, pointed to a potentially unprecedented combination of risks facing the country in his annual shareholder letter.Three forces are likely to shape the world over the next several decades: a U.S. economy rebounding from the Covid pandemic; high inflation that will usher in an era of rising rates, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian crisis now underway, according to Dimon.related investing newsOur conviction in Morgan Stanley remains solid, despite the CEO's planned departure Kevin Stankiewicz20 hours ago""Each of these three factors mentioned above is unique in its own right: The dramatic stimulus-fueled recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the likely need for rapidly raising rates and the required reversal of QE, and the war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia,"" Dimon wrote.""They present completely different circumstances than what we've experienced in the past – and their confluence may dramatically increase the risks ahead,"" he wrote. ""While it is possible, and hopeful, that all of these events will have peaceful resolutions, we should prepare for the potential negative outcomes."" Dimon's letter, read widely in business circles because of the JPMorgan CEO's status as his industry's most prominent spokesman, took a more downcast tone from his missive just last year. While he wrote extensively about challenges facing the country, including economic inequality and political dysfunction, that letter broadcast his belief that the U.S. was in the midst of a boom that could ""easily"" run into 2023.Now, however, the outbreak of the biggest European conflict since World War II has changed things, roiling markets, realigning alliances and restructuring global trade patterns, he wrote. That introduces both risks and opportunities for the U.S. and other democracies, according to Dimon.""The war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia, at a minimum, will slow the global economy — and it could easily get worse,"" Dimon wrote. That's because of the uncertainty about how the conflict will conclude and its impact on supply chains, especially for those involving energy supplies.Dimon added that for JPMorgan, management isn't worried about its direct exposure to Russia, though the bank could ""still lose about $1 billion over time.""Here are excerpts from Dimon's letter. ""We expect the fallout from the war and resulting sanctions to reduce Russia's GDP by 12.5% by midyear (a decline worse than the 10% drop after the 1998 default). Our economists currently think that the euro area, highly dependent on Russia for oil and gas, will see GDP growth of roughly 2% in 2022, instead of the elevated 4.5% pace we had expected just six weeks ago. By contrast, they expect the U.S. economy to advance roughly 2.5% versus a previously estimated 3%. But I caution that these estimates are based upon a fairly static view of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions now in place."" ""Many more sanctions could be added — which could dramatically, and unpredictably, increase their effect. Along with the unpredictability of war itself and the uncertainty surrounding global commodity supply chains, this makes for a potentially explosive situation. I speak later about the precarious nature of the global energy supply, but for now, simply, that supply is easy to disrupt."" ""America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes. … We must look at this as a wake-up call. We need to pursue short-term and long-term strategies with the goal of not only solving the current crisis but also maintaining the long-term unity of the newly strengthened democratic alliances. We need to make this a permanent, long-lasting stand for democratic ideals and against all forms of evil."" ""Russian aggression is having another dramatic and important result: It is coalescing the democratic, Western world — across Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries to Australia, Japan and Korea. […] The outcome of these two issues will transcend Russia and likely will affect geopolitics for decades, potentially leading to both a realignment of alliances and a restructuring of global trade.  How the West comports itself, and whether the West can maintain its unity, will likely determine the future global order and shape America's (and its allies') important relationship with China."" ""It also is clear that trade and supply chains, where they affect matters of national security, need to be restructured. You simply cannot rely on countries with different strategic interests for critical goods and services. Such reorganization does not need to be a disaster or decoupling. With thoughtful analysis and execution, it should be rational and orderly. This is in everyone's best interest."" ""For any products or materials that are essential for national security (think rare earths, 5G and semiconductors), the U.S. supply chain must either be domestic or open only to completely friendly allies. We cannot and should not ever be reliant on processes that can and will be used against us, especially when we are most vulnerable. For similar national security reasons, activities (including investment activities) that help create a national security risk — i.e., sharing critical technology with potential adversaries — should be restricted."" ""This restructuring will likely take place over time and does not need to be extraordinarily disruptive. There will be winners and losers — some of the main beneficiaries will be Brazil, Canada, Mexico and friendly Southeast Asian nations. Along with reconfiguring our supply chains, we must create new trading systems with our allies. As mentioned above, my preference would be to rejoin the TPP — it is the best geostrategic and trade arrangement possible with allied nations."" ""The Federal Reserve and the government did the right thing by taking bold dramatic actions following the misfortune unleashed by the pandemic. In hindsight, it worked. But also in hindsight, the medicine (fiscal spending and QE) was probably too much and lasted too long."" ""I do not envy the Fed for what it must do next: The stronger the recovery, the higher the rates that follow (I believe that this could be significantly higher than the markets expect) and the stronger the quantitative tightening (QT). If the Fed gets it just right, we can have years of growth, and inflation will eventually start to recede. In any event, this process will cause lots of consternation and very volatile markets. The Fed should not worry about volatile markets unless they affect the actual economy. A strong economy trumps market volatility."" ""One thing the Fed should do, and seems to have done, is to exempt themselves — give themselves ultimate flexibility — from the pattern of raising rates by only 25 basis points and doing so on a regular schedule. And while they may announce how they intend to reduce the Fed balance sheet, they should be free to change this plan on a moment's notice in order to deal with actual events in the economy and the markets. A Fed that reacts strongly to data and events in real time will ultimately create more confidence. In any case, rates will need to go up substantially. The Fed has a hard job to do so let's all wish them the best."" ""This year, we announced that the expenses related to investments would increase from $11.5 billion to $15 billion. I am going to try to describe the 'incremental investments' of $3.5 billion, though I can't review them all (and for competitive reasons I wouldn't). But we hope a few examples will give you comfort in our decision-making process.Some investments have a fairly predictable time to cash flow positive and a good and predictable return on investment (ROI) however you measure it. These investments include branches and bankers, around the world, across all our businesses. They also include certain marketing expenses, which have a known and quantifiable return. This category combined will add $1 billion to our expenses in 2022. ""Over the last 18 months, we spent nearly $5 billion on acquisitions, which will increase 'incremental investment' expenses by approximately $700 million in 2022. We expect most of these acquisitions to produce positive returns and strong earnings within a few years, fully justifying their cost. In a few cases, these acquisitions earn money — plus, we believe, help stave off erosion in other parts of our business."" ""Our international consumer expansion is an investment of a different nature. We believe the digital world gives us an opportunity to build a consumer bank outside the United States that, over time, can become very competitive — an option that does not exist in the physical world. We start with several advantages that we believe will get stronger over time. ... We have the talent and know-how to deliver these through cutting-edge technology, allowing us to harness the full range of these capabilities from all our businesses. We can apply what we have learned in our leading U.S. franchise and vice versa. We may be wrong on this one, but I like our hand."" ""Despite the pandemic and talent retention challenges, we continue to boost our representation among women and people of color. … More women were promoted to the position of managing director in 2021 than ever before; similarly, a record number of women were promoted to executive director. By year's end, based on employees that self-identified, women represented 49% of the firm's total workforce. Overall Hispanic representation was 20%, Asian representation grew to 17% and Black representation increased to 14%."""
2022-04-04,"At its heart the American Dream is a promise of progress — that each generation will have more opportunity for prosperity than the last. In the post-war era, parents were virtually able to take it for granted that their children would go further and do better than they had. However, the one-two economic punch of the Great Recession and the pandemic have put this promise in peril for millennials and Gen Z. In the face of these major economic setbacks, a real-time reordering of the American economy, and recent headwinds like high inflation, younger Americans will need to be more financially savvy to succeed.Right now, too many young Americans lack the fundamental knowledge needed to navigate such treacherous financial waters. According to the Milken Institute, only 57% of Americans are financially literate. A 2018 assessment of 15-year-old students found that 16% were below a proficient level of financial literacy and only 22% demonstrated a basic level of financial literacy. This lack of knowledge leaves young people unprepared at just the time in life when many of them are facing their first major financial challenges. In 2021, the average student loan debt was $37,693, with student loan debt the second-highest consumer debt category — second only to mortgage debt. Additionally, the average credit card debt for young people under the age of 24 was $1,963 last year.More from Invest in You:An easy guide to help college students set up their first budget16 U.S. cities where women under 30 earn more than their male peersThe ultimate retirement planning guide for 2022As we enter Financial Literacy Month, we must recognize the need for more financial education in schools and among young adults. An important first step is for states to recognize the need to mandate financial literacy courses in schools, so the youth of America is equipped with tools to prepare them for economic growth, stability, and opportunities after their graduation.By mandating financial basics classes as a requirement to graduate high school, we can ensure that students will enter the workforce and higher education programs with a strong platform of basic financial knowledge, including how to balance a checkbook, complete a loan application, do taxes, participate in lessons on interest rates, follow state and federal laws, and discover ways to save and invest. Thankfully, there are already bipartisan steps being taken to enact legislation to support financial literacy in high schools. Over 100 financial literacy bills have been introduced across 40 states in the last two years. In June 2021, Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee, a Democrat, signed a bill into law that requires all students at public high schools to pass financial literacy classes for graduation. This month in Florida, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis passed the Dorothy L. Hukill Financial Literacy Act. High school students will be required to earn at least one-half credit for instruction in financial literacy or money management. Florida is only the seventh state to require a standalone money management course. Standalone financial literacy courses are imperative as we cannot effectively teach personal finance in a condensed form and expect momentous results. Students must be provided the time and resources to engage in real-world experiences.In trying and uncertain economic times, financial literacy and education can make the difference between having a strong foundation for prosperity or feeling helpless in the face of forces beyond one's control. It is imperative that state legislators on both sides of the aisle continue to pass legislation that fosters financial literacy, specifically in underserved communities that traditionally lack the resources for young adults to develop lifelong habits necessary for financial success.—By Heidi Heitkamp, former U.S Senator, North Dakota, and the founder of One Country Project.SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

Meanwhile, spillovers from the war will be felt acutely in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE),"" Capital Economics Chief Emerging Markets Economist William Jackson said in the report.""Industry will be hit by supply disruptions and higher inflation will weigh on households' real incomes and dampen consumer spending. We expect the war to shave 1.0-1.5%-pts off growth in CEE this year.""The outlook for Russia may yet darken further following the emergence over the weekend of allegations of civilian massacres by Russian forces in Bucha and other Ukrainian towns. The alleged atrocities will push back expectations for peace talks and increase the threat of more punitive international sanctions.Ukraine's top prosecutor said on Sunday that 410 bodies had been found in towns recaptured from retreating Russian forces around Kyiv as part of an investigation into possible war crimes, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of genocide. Russia has denied allegations that its forces killed civilians in Bucha, 23 miles northwest of Kyiv. The European Union plans to introduce fresh sanctions against Moscow in the wake of the new reported atrocities, with European Council President Charles Michel announcing on Twitter that ""further EU sanctions & support are on their way.""British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will travel to Poland on Monday to meet with Ukrainian and Polish counterparts ahead of talks with G-7 and NATO allies later this week, and is expected to call for tougher sanctions against Russia.Despite the sharp declines in Russia's March PMIs, Goldman Sachs noted on Friday that activity across some CEEMEA economies was surprisingly robust, with gains in Hungary and South Africa offset by declines in Poland and the Czech Republic.""Hungary's PMI has been relatively volatile in recent months, so we would downplay the significance of its gain (not least because our analysis suggests that it is relatively exposed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict),"" Goldman economists wrote.""For South Africa, its direct trade with Russia and Ukraine is limited, while it is benefiting from higher commodity prices."""
2022-04-05,"San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly compared high inflation with unemployment, saying that higher prices are ""as harmful as not having a job.""Daly said the Fed will use its tools to combat inflation. ""If you don't have that confidence, let me give it to you,"" she said. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly is worried about inflation, telling an audience Tuesday that the high cost of living is causing a heavy burden on society.""I understand that inflation is as harmful as not having a job,"" she said, ""that if you have a job and you can't pay your bills, or I feel like I can't save for what I need to do, then that's keeping you up at night.""""And our goal is to make sure that people don't stay up worrying about whether their dollar today will be the same and worth a dollar tomorrow,"" she said, during a session presented by the Native American Finance Officers Association. Daly spoke as the Fed embarks on a policy tightening phase that will include higher interest rates and a reduction in the amount of bonds the central bank is holding. Fed officials hope that reversing the ultra-easy policies they put into place during the pandemic will help get inflation closer to their 2% longer-run goal.The consumer price index, which measures a basket of dozens of common items, is running at a 7.9% rate over the past 12 months, the highest in more than 40 years.While she didn't specify how quickly she thinks the Fed will move, Daly said the efforts will have an impact.""It will mean interest rates go up, making it harder to finance a car or a business,"" she said.""Most Americans, most people, most businesses, hopefully people in tribal nations, you all have confidence that we're not going to let this go forever,"" she added. ""But if you don't have that confidence, let me give it to you.""Even with the higher rates, Daly said, she doesn't see the economy entering recession, though she expects things to slow.She said the economy ""could teeter,"" but ""nothing that tips us into recession this year."""
2022-04-05,"Research conducted by CNBC and Acorns in partnership with Momentive finds that most Americans say they are under more financial stress now than a year agoENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. and SAN MATEO, CA, April 5, 2022 – CNBC, First in Business Worldwide, and Acorns, the country's fastest growing financial wellness system, today announced the results of the Invest in You: The Great Squeeze Survey. The national survey, conducted in partnership with Momentive (NASDAQ: MNTV – maker of SurveyMonkey), a leader in agile experience management, examined how inflation is impacting people's financial behavior by surveying more than 3,950 Americans ages 18 and up.According to the findings, the vast majority of those surveyed (81%) say the U.S. economy will likely experience a recession in 2022 as 76% say they worry that higher prices will force them to rethink their financial choices in the coming months.As a result of inflation pressures, almost half (48%) of adults surveyed say they think about rising prices ""all the time"", while 44% say they think about rising prices ""sometimes"" or ""occasionally"". Only a few of those surveyed say they ""rarely"" or ""never"" think of rising prices. Additionally, just over half (52%) of adults say they are under more financial stress now than a year ago. Nearly a third (32%) of lower income Americans who say they are under ""much more"" financial stress now compared to a year ago.Additional findings from the CNBC + Acorns Invest in You: The Great Squeeze Survey include:To help combat higher prices, most Americans have started to cut back.53% of those surveyed say higher prices have already caused them to dine out less often in the last six months. 39% say they have been driving less and 35% say they have canceled a monthly subscription.In the event higher prices continue, 52% say they'll cut back on dining out, 42% will cut back on driving, and 40% say they'll have to think about canceling a vacation.21% of adults say gas prices have caused them the most financial stress over the last year followed by housing costs (16%) and food costs (13%).The vast majority (83%) of parents with children under 18 say parents are most responsible for teaching children about finance.But 31% of parents say they ""never"" talk to their children about household finances40% of parents say they talk to their kids about money on a monthly basis or lessBlack parents were almost twice as likely than white parents to say they talk to their kids about household finances on a weekly basis (21% of Black parents vs. 12% of white parents.)""The public health crisis may be receding, but the financial hits keep coming for Americans still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Jon Cohen, Chief Research Officer at Momentive. ""The pressures of skyrocketing costs at the pump and elsewhere are causing deepening stress, and the sense of foreboding about a future downturn is now widespread.""CNBC Senior Personal Finance Correspondent Sharon Epperson will reveal the results of the Invest in You: The Great Squeeze Survey today, Tuesday, April 5th, throughout CNBC's Business Day programming.

2022-04-06,"President Gotabaya Rajapaksa replaced his brother Basil Rajapaksa as finance minister, but new appointee Ali Sabry resigned just a day later.At least 41 Sri Lankan lawmakers walked out of the ruling coalition on Tuesday, leaving the government of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in a minority in Parliament.Sri Lanka's cabinet and central bank governor quit on Monday in the face of mounting public anger and mass protests over rising food and fuel prices. ""Gotta go, Gotabaya,"" chanted thousands of people who came out on the streets of Sri Lanka to demand the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, defying a state of emergency in what analysts called the Sri Lankan version of the Arab Spring. The president later revoked the state of emergency, which had not stopped the demonstrations.""It's the Arab Spring in Sri Lanka. It's a perfect match with the pattern of an Arab Spring: a people's uprising to end authoritarian rule, economic mismanagement and family rule, and install democracy,"" Asanga Abeyagoonasekera, senior fellow at Millennium Project in Washington, told CNBC.The Sri Lankan High Commission in Singapore did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Arab Spring refers to a series of protests that began with the self-immolation of a vendor in Tunisia in 2010 and spread across several countries in the Arab world such as Egypt, Libya, and Syria against authoritarianism, corruption, and poverty. As many as four autocrats, including Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, were ousted during the Arab Spring.The powerful Rajapaksa clan has ruled Sri Lanka for decades and came back, after a brief spell out of power, in 2019 when Gotabaya was elected president. Although troubled by corruption allegations, the current dissatisfaction stems from economic mismanagement. Gotabaya was once popular for ending a decades-long civil war in 2009, with a bloody bombing campaign against Tamil separatists.At least 41 Sri Lankan lawmakers walked out of the ruling coalition, leaving the Rajapaksa government in a minority in Parliament. On the same day, the government was dealt another blow when finance minister Ali Sabry resigned just a day after his appointment.""I believe I have always acted in the best interests of the country,"" Sabry said in a statement. He said ""fresh, proactive and unconventional steps"" were needed to solve the country's problems. Like the crisis in Sri Lanka, the Arab Spring was also triggered by economic stagnation and corruption in Tunisia, said Chulanee Attanayake, research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore.""Sri Lanka is also witnessing anti-government protests in response to an economic downturn, rising inflation and shortage of essential goods. Similar slogans as during the Arab Spring are also being used,"" he said. An association of medical professionals in Sri Lanka has declared a health emergency over a shortage of medicine and equipment, local media reported.But Fung Siu, principal economist for Asia with the Economic Intelligence Unit, a think tank, disagreed with the Arab Spring parallel. ""Triggers for the Arab Spring were years in the making, while discontent in Sri Lanka can be traced back to the onset of the pandemic and bad policy choices,"" she said. Sri Lanka's cabinet and central bank governor quit on Monday in the face of mounting public anger and mass protests over rising food and fuel prices. Sri Lanka has sought IMF bailouts 16 times in the past 56 years, second only to debt-ridden Pakistan.Fung said a fresh IMF loan could help but a period of fiscal austerity would follow.""Although such efforts will help to address imbalances, higher taxes will probably stoke anti-government sentiment further,"" she said.Faith in the government has also plunged, Attanayake said, adding that disappointment has grown since the country's independence. ""The events happening right now show the public's lack of trust in the political leadership, and their impatience, frustration, and disappointment. They will not tolerate the missteps, mishandling and mistakes anymore,"" he said. The 26 cabinet ministers who resigned include Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa's son, Namal, who tweeted that he hoped it would help the president and prime minister's ""decision to establish stability for the people and the government."" Sri Lankan Member of Parliament and opposition leader Harsha de Silva said on Tuesday that only a fresh election could present a solution.""The reshuffle is only temporary. They have appointed only four members to the cabinet… I don't think they have any credibility left to stay on. So unless we are able to build back confidence, I do not know how to get this country's economy back on track. The only way to do that is to have a fresh mandate for a new set of people,"" de Silva said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""Still, the MP said it was too early to tell if the president would be forced to step down.""This pressure started building up only 48 hours ago,"" he said. ""Things are moving fast today, and Parliament will meet after two weeks. And then we can see if the government still holds the majority."" Asked if he was open to joining a national unity government, de Silva signaled assent. But, he continued: ""The problem, however, is that this country is no longer going to tolerate any Rajapaksas in government. So it is not going to be possible to work in a government with the Rajapaksas."""
2022-04-06,"Teens are spending more and shifting their shopping habits, even as they worry over growing economic uncertainty, according to Piper Sandler's biannual ""Taking Stock With Teens"" survey.They're also increasingly concerned about the Russian war in Ukraine, and less preoccupied with the Covid-19 pandemic.Plus, many teens say they're either unsure of or uninterested in the so-called metaverse. Teens are spending more and shifting their shopping habits, even as they worry about growing economic uncertainty, according to a new survey.Athletic apparel brands such as Lululemon and Nike that combine comfort and fashion are winning out over traditional clothing labels, Piper Sandler's biannual ""Taking Stock With Teens"" report released on Wednesday revealed.Many teens say they're either unsure of or uninterested in the so-called metaverse — the idea of buying goods through a virtual reality experience. Retailers including Nike, PacSun, Forever 21 and Ralph Lauren have all been dipping their toes in the budding technology.A growing number of teenagers also say they're much more familiar with NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, than they were last fall, while only a small percentage have actually purchased one.But they're also increasingly concerned about the Russian war in Ukraine, the survey revealed, and are less preoccupied with the Covid-19 pandemic.The results of the biannual survey have implications for the businesses vying to win over this generation's dollars. That's particularly true now with the economic environment riddled with uncertainty.Teens plan to spend about $2,367 this year on everything from fast food meals and video games to handbags and sneakers, Piper Sandler found, or an estimated overall total of roughly $66 billion. That's up 9% from reported spending levels in the spring 2021 report, and up 4% from Piper Sandler's fall survey. Reported annual spending by teens peaked at about $3,023, in the spring of 2006. Piper Sandler surveyed 7,100 teens from Feb. 16 to March 22. The average age of those surveyed was 16.2 and the average household income was $69,298. Thirty-nine percent of the teens surveyed were employed part-time, up from 38% last fall and 33% last spring. Though teen-spending levels have improved steadily since a trough in the fall of 2020, businesses still grapple with the question of what could derail growth and whether consumers will pull back in their spending.A whopping 71% teens reported to Piper Sandler that they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, up from 56% who felt that way last fall, and 46% last spring.When asked which political or social issues mattered the most to them, teens' top response was Russia's invasion of Ukraine, at 13%. That was followed by the environment, at 11%; racial equality, at 10%; gas prices, at 10%; and inflation, at 4%.Coronavirus notably fell off the list of teens' top 10 concerns, after ranking fourth in Piper Sandler's survey last fall as well as last spring.Piper Sandler consumer analyst Matt Egger noted that the continued concern among Generation Z consumers on the environment bodes well for rental platforms such as Rent the Runway and resale businesses like ThredUp and The RealReal. Meanwhile, Nike remained the No. 1 favored clothing brand among teens, a spot it has held for an impressive 11 consecutive years. It also widened its margin as the preferred footwear brand among Gen Z shoppers, the survey said, ahead of Converse, Adidas, Vans, New Balance and Crocs, in that order.American Eagle kept its spot as teens' second-favorite apparel brand, followed by Lululemon, which moved up one position on the list from the prior year. Fast-fashion retailer H&M rose to fourth from ninth a year earlier. Adidas remained in fifth place.Overall, the athletic brands mentioned in the survey released Wednesday accounted for 44% of teens' favorite clothing labels, the highest levels that Piper Sandler has seen for the category. That aligns with a broader shift among consumers during the pandemic, toward stretchy and more loose-fitting clothing to be worn around the house. And many teens are still incorporating athletic brands into their wardrobes even as they head back to schools and offices.Shein, a Chinese e-commerce fashion behemoth that is reportedly weighing a funding round at a valuation of about $100 billion, ranked seventh for teens' favorite place to buy clothes, down from sixth in the fall of 2021 but up from eighth last spring.Females continue to widely outspend males on clothing, according to the Piper Sandler survey, while males spend, on average, about $51 more that females on shoes each year.Amazon remained by far the favorite website to shop overall, taking a 53% share, up from 52% last fall. Shein remained in second place, but its share of teens' preference fell to 8% from 9%. Other retailers on the list were Nike, PacSun, Lululemon and Princess Polly, in that order.When it comes to the metaverse and platforms such as Roblox or Decentraland, 26% of teens reported they own some sort of virtual reality device, with just 5% using it daily. Forty-eight percent said they are either unsure of or not interested in the metaverse."
2022-04-06,"New research from AARP and pollsters finds 52% of women ages 50 and up say the economy is not working well for them, up from 37% in 2019.The top issues on these women's minds: kitchen table budgets and rising prices.That could influence this large group of reliable voters as they head to the polls in November. Women ages 50 and over are one of the largest, most reliable groups of voters.And going into this election season, they're not happy with the economy, according to new research from AARP in partnership with pollsters Celinda Lake, Christine Matthews, Kristen Soltis Anderson and Margie Omero.Their recent poll found 52% of women in this age cohort say the economy is not working well for them, up from 37% in 2019.The top issues on these women's minds: kitchen table budgets and the day-to-day impact of rising prices, according to the research.More from Personal Finance:Medicare is now covering the cost of at-home Covid testsAs Social Security retirement age moves to 67, some say it may go higherThese states have the highest and lowest tax burdensAbout 46% of women 50 and over surveyed said the rising cost of living is the most important issue facing the U.S. now.Moreover, 59% said rising prices are the most important aspect of the economy for them personally.The poll was conducted online and over the phone between Feb. 18 and March 3. It included 1,836 voters ages 50 and up who are likely to vote in 2022.Women in that age cohort have not yet decided which candidates to support, the poll found. But their vote will very likely influence which parties win a majority in Congress and in statehouses. Just 17% of female voters ages 50 and over have made up their minds on how they plan to vote in November.Meanwhile, 65% say they will not decide until weeks or days before Election Day.The reason why many of these female voters are undecided is because they are unhappy with their current leaders, said Celinda Lake, founder and president of Lake Research Partners, during a webcast on the research's findings.""This dissatisfaction is leading this cohort, which usually makes up its mind early, to be undecided about how they're going to vote,"" Lake said. Democrat, Republican and independent voters all gave politicians failing grades on most issues.""Across the board, when it came to prices rising faster than income, you saw women of all parties saying politicians were doing a bad job,"" Lake said. ""When you have elected leaders doing a bad job on the No. 1 issue that people are obsessed with … then you have a very, very volatile situation.""The votes they cast could have a significant influence on the election results. Women age 50 and over represent 27% of registered voters. In the 2018 and 2020 elections, they cast 30% of all ballots.Notably, women ages 50 and over are about evenly divided by party, with 44% supporting Republicans and 45% Democrats. In contrast, men in that age group lean Republican, with 51%, versus 38% Democrat. The economy will likely still be top of mind for these female voters vote in November.Currently, 72% of women ages 50 and up are worried about having enough income to keep up with rising costs.Many of these women are not optimistic that the situation will improve in the next 12 months, with 47% indicating they expect their financial circumstances to stay the same and 39% believing it will get worse. Just 13% said they think it will improve.For women ages 50 through 64, retirement is a big concern. The poll found 51% of women are worried about whether Social Security will be there for them, while 30% are concerned about having enough savings."
2022-04-07,"St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the central bank is ""behind the curve"" on interest rates, but it's making progress.Bullard said a rules-based approach suggests the central bank needs to hike its benchmark short-term borrowing rate to about 3.5%. The comments come the day after minutes from the March FOMC meeting indicated officials were close to approving a 50-basis-point rate hike but settled on 25 points. The Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates substantially to control inflation but may not be as ""behind the curve"" as it appears, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Thursday.One of the Federal Open Market Committee's most ""hawkish"" members in favor of tighter policy, Bullard said a rules-based approach suggests the central bank needs to hike its benchmark short-term borrowing rate to about 3.5%.However, he said bond market adjustments to the Fed's more aggressive policy, in which yields have surged higher, suggest rates are not that far askew.""If you take account of [forward guidance], we don't look so bad. Not all hope is lost. That is the basic gist of this story,"" Bullard said in a speech at the University of Missouri. ""You're still behind the curve, but not as much as it looks like,"" he added. Markets are pricing in rates hitting the 3.5% rate in the summer of 2023, a bit slower than Bullard anticipates, according to CME Group data.The comments come the day after minutes from the March FOMC meeting indicated officials were close to approving a 50-basis-point rate hike but settled on 25 points due to uncertainty around the war in Ukraine. A basis point equals 0.01%In addition, members said they foresee the Fed starting to shed some assets on its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, with the likely pace evolving to a maximum $95 billion a month.Both moves are an effort to control inflation running at its fastest pace in more than 40 years.Bullard, a voting member on the FOMC this year, said Thursday that ""inflation is too high"" and the Fed needs to act. In projections released in March, Bullard called for the highest rates among his committee peers. He has said he wants to see 100 basis points' worth of hikes by June. The benchmark fed funds rate now is in a range targeted between 0.25%-0.5%.""U.S. inflation is exceptionally high, and that doesn't mean 2.1% or 2.2% or something. This means comparable to what we saw in the high inflation era in the 1970s and early 1980s,"" he said. ""Even if you're very generous to the Fed in interpreting what the inflation rate really is today … you'd have to raise the policy rate a lot.""The Fed uses ""forward guidance,"" such as its quarterly dot plot of individual members' interest and economic expectations, in directing the market to where it thinks policy is going.Judging by moves in Treasury yields, the market already has priced in aggressive Fed tightening. That makes the central bank not so far behind the curve in the inflation fight as it might appear, Bullard said.""The difference between today and the 1970s is central bankers have a lot more credibility,"" he said. ""In the '70s, no one believed the Fed would do anything about inflation. It was kind of a chaotic era. You really needed (former Fed Chair Paul) Volcker to come in … . He slayed the inflation dragon and established credibility. After that, people believed the central bank would bring inflation under control.""Volcker's rate hikes did bring down inflation in the early 1980s, but not without triggering a double-dip recession."
2022-04-07,"Initial claims for unemployment benefits are a proxy for layoffs. Claims last week fell near an all-time low set in November 1968. Job openings and the number of people leaving a job voluntarily are near record highs. Wage growth is its strongest in years as businesses compete for talent. Inflation, higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine are potential headwinds in coming months.  Claims for unemployment insurance last week fell to their lowest level in more than 50 years — yet another sign workers are reaping the benefits of a hot labor market.Americans filed 166,000 initial claims for jobless benefits in the week ended April 2, the Labor Department said Thursday. Initial claims are a proxy for layoffs.The figure is a pandemic-era low. It also nearly ties the all-time trough.The Labor Department began tracking jobless claims in 1967. Since then, just one other week in history has seen fewer claims for benefits: 162,000 in November 1968.However, today's labor force is over double its size in 1968 (about 79 million people versus 164 million), making last week's milestone noteworthy on a proportional basis.  ""Employers appear to be holding on to their workers very tightly, as affirmed by the latest look at new jobless claims,"" according to Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.Other federal data indicate a strong labor market for workers, too.Job openings and the number of people who leave their job voluntarily each remain near record-high levels set at the end of 2021.Many have left their jobs for other opportunities amid the high demand for labor and for a big bump in pay. Annual wage growth has been higher than at any point in over 20 years, according to economists at Indeed, a job site, as employers compete for talent.  The rate at which businesses are laying off workers is also near a record low as businesses try to hold onto their staff.The national unemployment rate — 3.6% in March — is approaching historic lows, too. It has fallen near the 3.5% prepandemic rate in February 2020, which had been the lowest unemployment rate since December 1969.Workers on the sidelines have rejoined the labor force at a fast clip in recent months, according to Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.More from Personal Finance:3 ways to avoid taking on too much student loan debtWhat to do if you don't get a 401(k) plan at workDemand for used cars drops but high prices aren't budgingMore than 2.1 million workers have come back in the last three months alone, providing a ""fresh pool of available workers to fuel continued job creation,"" he said.""Demand for labor remains strong and layoffs should remain low as employers struggle to fill near-record openings,"" Baird added.While the U.S. economy hasn't yet fully regained all the 22 million jobs lost in the early months of the pandemic, the rapid pace of job creation puts the country on a trajectory to regain them in June (if the current trend holds). However, there are headwinds that may have a dampening effect on the labor market.The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, in March began a cycle of raising its benchmark interest rate to cool the economy and rein in inflation. Higher rates make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow money.And inflation, which is running at a 40-year high, is pushing up prices for goods and services across the economy. The average person has seen rising costs eclipse their wage growth, eroding purchasing power. (This isn't true for all workers, though, such as nonsupervisory workers in bars and restaurants, whose wage growth has risen faster than inflation.) Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also warned Wednesday that Russia's attack on Ukraine ""will have enormous economic repercussions for the world.""These challenges will test households and businesses in coming months, Hamrick said.""That [unemployment] claims remain so low at a time of such turmoil suggests that, for now at least, the economy is holding up in the face of soaring crude oil, gasoline and other prices,"" Hamrick said. ""How long this can persist remains to be seen."""
2022-04-07,"Congress voted to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status, an economic downgrade that allows steeper tariffs on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.The bill is a formal step to sever normal economic ties with Russia. The measure now goes to President Joe Biden for signature into law.Separately, Congress voted codify a promise Biden made to ban the import of Russian oil and other petroleum products.European Union envoys are set to approve on Thursday an embargo on Russian coal, though the timing of the phase-in period remained a matter of debate. Congress on Thursday voted to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status, an economic downgrade that opens the door to damaging new tariffs on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.The House passed the bill in an overwhelming 420-3 vote, sending it to President Joe Biden's desk. The Senate approved the same version of the legislation in a unanimous 100-0 vote taken earlier Thursday.The three members of Congress who opposed the effort to strip Russia's favored status were Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Matt Gaetz of Florida, all Republicans who strongly align themselves with former President Donald Trump.The bill, known as HR 7108, is a formal step to sever normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus — one of the Kremlin's closest allies — and allow import controls on key products like platinum, chemicals, iron and steel.The U.S. has already cut its normal trade relationship with Moscow in practice: the Biden administration moved to ban imports of oil, vodka, diamonds and seafood from Russia last month. ""No nation whose military is committing war crimes deserves free trade status with the United States,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday on the Senate floor. ""No vile thug like Putin deserves to stand as an equal with the leaders of the free world. He is a menace and a pariah who has ensured his place in history will be one of everlasting shame.""Most favored nation status ensures that any member of the World Trade Organization receives equal trade treatment from other members and grants each designee immunity from a raft of steep import penalties.""There are two categories you can be characterized under U.S. law: One gets lower tariffs, and one gets higher,"" said Clete Willems, a partner at law firm Akin Gump and a former U.S. attorney at the WTO.""All other WTO members get this lower [tariff] rate — the average is about 2.8%,"" he added. ""And then for non-MFN, the average is around 20%. And so this legislation will change the tariff treatment of all of those products.""Congress also voted to codify a promise Biden made last month to ban the import of Russian energy products into the United States. That bill cleared the Senate 100-0, and passed the House 413-9.Many nations, including the Group of Seven, have promised to work to end the West's economic relations with Russia as the U.S. and its allies open investigations into what are likely to be deemed war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.The Biden administration and its partners have worked to limit the Kremlin's access to global financial organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have also moved in tandem to block Russia's access to currencies other than the ruble, as well as target individuals and families close to Russian President Vladimir Putin with sanctions.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says the barrage of economic penalties are designed to dent the ruble, ruin the Russian stock market and otherwise sap Moscow's economy over time. Through the moves, the U.S. hopes to undermine Putin's authority in the Russian military and among the country's wealthy oligarchs.The most favored nation bill should been considered ""additive"" and damaging in the context of an international, coordinated effort, attorney Willems said.""It's one among many moves that together start to have a real impact on the Russian economy,"" he said. ""The president will have the authority to raise tariffs on other select products. And the key imports we get from them beyond oil are platinum, chemicals, iron and steel, plywood, some kinds of engines, and titanium.""

2022-04-08,"Federal Reserve policymakers are going to try to slow down the economy and subdue inflation.Higher rates make money costlier and borrowing less appealing. That, in turn, slows demand to catch up with supply, which has lagged badly throughout the pandemic.Fed officials also have talked tough on inflation, in an effort to dampen future expectations.Potential effects include lower wages, a halt or even a drop in home prices and a decline in stock market valuations. The view that higher interest rates help stamp out inflation is essentially an article of faith, based on long-held economic gospel of supply and demand.But how does it really work? And will it work this time around, when bloated prices seem at least partially beyond the reach of conventional monetary policy?It is this dilemma that has Wall Street confused and markets volatile.In normal times, the Federal Reserve is seen as the cavalry coming into quell soaring prices. But this time, the central bank is going to need some help.""Can the Fed bring down inflation on their own? I think the answer is 'no,'"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. ""They certainly can help rein in the demand side by higher interest rates. But it's not going to unload container ships, it's not going to reopen production capacity in China, it's not going to hire the long-haul truckers we need to get things across the country.""Still, policymakers are going to try to slow down the economy and subdue inflation.The approach is two-pronged: The central bank will raise benchmark short-term interest rates while also reducing the more than $8 trillion in bonds it has accumulated over the years to help keep money flowing through the economy.Under the Fed blueprint, the transmission from those actions into lower inflation goes something like this:The higher rates make money costlier and borrowing less appealing. That, in turn, slows demand to catch up with supply, which has lagged badly throughout the pandemic. Less demand means merchants will be under pressure to cut prices to lure people to buy their products. Potential effects include lower wages, a halt or even a drop in soaring home prices and, yes, a decline in valuations for a stock market that has thus far held up fairly well in the face of soaring inflation and the fallout from the war in Ukraine.""The Fed has been reasonably successful in convincing markets that they have their eye on the ball, and long-term inflation expectations have been held in check,"" Baird said. ""As we look forward, that will continue to be the primary focus. It's something that we're watching very closely, to make sure that investors don't lose faith in [the central bank's] ability to keep a lid on long-term inflation.""Consumer inflation rose at a 7.9% annual pace in February and probably surged at an even faster pace in March. Gasoline prices jumped 38% during the 12-month period, while food rose 7.9% and shelter costs were up 4.7%, according to the Labor Department. There's also a psychological factor in the equation: Inflation is thought to be something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. When the public thinks the cost of living will be higher, they adjust their behavior accordingly. Businesses boost the prices they charge and workers demand better wages. That rinse-and-repeat cycle can potentially drive inflation even higher.That's why Fed officials not only have approved their first rate hike in more than three years, but they also have talked tough on inflation, in an effort to dampen future expectations.In that vein, Fed Governor Lael Brainard — long a proponent of lower rates — delivered a speech Tuesday that stunned markets when she said policy needs to get a lot tighter.It's a combination of these approaches — tangible moves on policy rates, plus ""forward guidance"" on where things are headed — that the Fed hopes will bring down inflation.""They do need to slow growth,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""If they take a little bit of the steam out of the equity market and credit spreads widen and underwriting standards get a little tighter and housing-price growth slows, all those things will contribute to a slowing in the growth in demand. That's a key part of what they're trying to do here, trying to get financial conditions to tighten up a bit so that demand growth slows and the economy will moderate.""Financial conditions by historical standards are currently considered loose, though getting tighter.  Indeed, there are a lot of moving parts, and policymakers' biggest fear is that in tamping down inflation they don't bring the rest of the economy down at the same time.""They need a little bit of luck here. If they get it I think they'll be able to pull it off,"" Zandi said. ""If they do, inflation will moderate as supply-side problems abate and demand growth slows. If they're unable to keep inflation expectations tethered, then no, we're going into a stagflation scenario and they're going to need to pull the economy into a recession.""(Worth noting: Some at the Fed don't believe expectations matter. This widely discussed white paper by one of the central bank's own economists in 2021 expressed doubt about the impact, saying the belief rests on ""extremely shaky foundations."") People around during the last serious bout of stagflation, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, remember that impact well. Faced with runaway prices, then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker spearheaded an effort to jack up the fed funds rate to nearly 20%, plunging the economy into a recession before taming the inflation beast.Needless to say, Fed officials want to avoid a Volcker-like scenario. But after months of insisting that inflation was ""transitory,"" a late-to-the-party central bank is forced now to tighten quickly.""Whether or not what they've got plotted out is enough, we will find out in time,"" Paul McCulley, former chief economist at bond giant Pimco and now a senior fellow at Cornell, told CNBC in a Wednesday interview. ""What they're telling us is, if it's not enough we will do more, which is implicitly recognizing that they will increase downside risks for the economy. But they are having their Volcker moment.""

There are about 5 million more job openings now than there is available labor, according to the Labor Department, reflecting one of the tightest jobs markets in history.But that situation is contributing to surging wages, which were up 5.6% from a year ago in March. Goldman Sachs economists say the jobs gap is a situation the Fed must address or risk persistent inflation. The firm said the Fed may need to take gross domestic product growth down to the 1%-1.5% annual range to slow the jobs market, which implies an even higher policy rate than the markets are currency pricing — and less wiggle room for the economy to tip into at least a shallow downturn. So it's a delicate balance for the Fed as it tries to use its monetary arsenal to bring down prices.Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis, is worried that a wobbly growth picture now could test the Fed's resolve.""Outside of recession, you're not going to get inflation down,"" said LaVorgna, who was chief economist at the National Economic Council under former President Donald Trump. ""It's very easy for the Fed to talk tough now. But if you go a few more hikes and all of a sudden the employment picture shows weakness, is the Fed really going to keep talking tough?""LaVorgna is watching the steady growth of prices that are not subject to economic cycles and are rising just as quickly as cyclical products. They also may not be as subject to the pressure from interest rates and are rising for reasons not tied to loose policy.""If you think about inflation, you have to slow demand,"" he said. ""Now we've got a supply component to it. They can't do anything about supply, that's why they may have to compress demand more than they normally would. That's where you get recession."""
2022-04-08,"American consumers are already cutting back on spending, according to a new CNBC survey.For many living paycheck to paycheck, this is not a surprise, as inflation rises and Covid stimulus savings decline.However, the survey also shows that higher-income consumers are showing signs of financial stress and have begun cutting back on dining out, travel and vacations, and cars. With as much as 60% of U.S. consumers living paycheck to paycheck, it's not a surprise to see that the spending cutbacks have started. Even with a strong job market and wage gains, as well as Covid stimulus savings, price spikes in core spending categories including food, gas and shelter are leading more Americans to mind their pocketbooks closely.A new survey from CNBC and Momentive finds rising concerns about inflation and the risk of recession and Americans saying that not only have they started buying less but that they'll buy less across more categories if inflation persists. But these financial stress points are not limited to lower-income consumers. The survey finds Americans with incomes of at least $100,000 saying they've cut back on spending or may soon do so in numbers that are not far off the decisions being made by lower-income groups.The high-income consumer demographic is key to the economy. While it represents only one-third of consumers, it is responsible for up to three-quarters of the spending. ""If the high-income consumers are out buying, we won't see a big impact on raw consumer activity,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. Lower-income households are the most at risk, and they are the ones most likely to be making unwelcome tradeoffs to make their money stretch as far as it did just a few months ago, according to the survey results. They are also clearly experiencing more financial anxiety, according to the survey, with 57% of Americans with income under $50,000 saying they are under more stress than a year ago, versus 45% of those with incomes of $100,000 or more. The 68% of high-income consumers who said they are worried higher prices will force them to rethink financial decisions is significantly lower than the 82% of Americans with income of $50,000 or less who told the survey this, but it is still a majority. More than half of people with household incomes under $50,000 say they have already cut back on multiple expenses due to prices, and for those with income of at least $100,000, the cutback levels are already similar when it comes to dining out, taking vacations, and buying a car.""People making six-figure incomes are almost as worried about inflation as people making half as much —and they are just as likely to be taking steps to mitigate its effect on their lives,"" said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at Momentive. ""Inflation is a problem that compounds over time, and even high-income individuals won't be insulated from the second- and third-order effects of price increases."" Other recent consumer survey data paints a weakening picture.The University of Michigan Survey of Consumers finds more consumers mentioning reduced living standards due to rising inflation than at any other time in the survey's history except during the two worst recessions in the past 50 years: from March 1979 to April 1981 and from May to October 2008. Notably, the consumer confidence gap between low- and high-income levels always shrinks at cyclical troughs and is always widest at peak, and the gap is narrowing now, according to survey director Richard Curtin. In January, the percentage point gap between the lowest-income group and highest-income group in the survey's sentiment index was 13.2 points. That was erased in March, with the top-income group sentiment actually dipping below the lowest-income bracket in overall sentiment and future expectations. In January, the higher-income group expectations, specifically, were 18 percentage points higher.Right now, there is a unique set of issues that could be exacerbating this gap narrowing, Curtin said, including the potential for Russia's invasion of Ukraine to do more damage to the global economy than forecast and the fact that the majority of the population has not experienced 10%+ inflation, or 15% mortgage rates, as past generations had.""Even at lower rates they may display behaviors associated with more extreme economic conditions in the past,"" Curtin said. ""Precautionary motives play a big part in consumption trends for upper income groups."" ""The American consumer is in a dark mood,"" Zandi said of the CNBC survey data. It's been more than two years since the pandemic hit, first with millions of lost jobs and high unemployment, and now high inflation, and ""fractured politics also weighing heavily on the collective psyche.""All income groups in the survey are equally likely to say the economy will enter a recession this year, at over 80%. But there is a key caveat: Spending actions from the economy don't yet indicate this prediction will come true.Despite the downbeat feelings about their financial situations, and the cutbacks, consumers are still spending strongly, Zandi emphasized. There are now lots of jobs, unemployment is low, debt loads are light, asset prices are high, and there is a lot of excess saving. Even if people are cutting back, spending less on some items, the mood has not yet taken control of the spending motivation to a degree that amounts to more than a slowdown in economic growth. ""I suspect the American consumer will continue spending, regardless of their mood, as long as the job market remains strong,"" Zandi said.

She said the gap does always narrow in a prerecession period — but its data is not indicating a recession as of now.What its confidence survey is forecasting is a slowdown in growth over the next few quarters driven by higher prices, and more Americans spending less on discretionary items as more of their money goes to covering the basics. That will be most acutely felt by the lower-income consumers, but there is broad-based concern about prices rising significantly in the months ahead — 6 out of every 10 consumers surveyed by The Conference Board think the Russia-Ukraine war will cause prices to rise significantly.""That is very broad-based and that, coupled with interest rates going up, may make people more hesitant to postpone big-ticket purchases like housing and autos and washing machines,"" Franco said. ""We will see a bit of slowing in consumer spending over the next few quarters, but we don't feel that will drive us into recession.""The overall confidence level from Americans with income of $125,000 in its survey has come back down from mid-2021, but Franco described them as still ""relatively confident despite all volatility we have seen. ... The indications we are getting across income groups speaks more towards softening in consumer spending rather than a severe pullback.""The Conference Board data, similar to other outlooks, is underpinned by a key role for the labor market in supporting confidence and balancing the negative influence of inflation, with Americans who say jobs are ""plentiful"" at an all-time high.  More from the CNBC | Momentive consumer surveyWhat consumers plan to cut back on Majority of U.S. worried about a 2022 recessionAmericans are rethinking their financial choicesCNBC|Momentive financial literacy poll: Full results What consumers plan to cut back on Majority of U.S. worried about a 2022 recessionAmericans are rethinking their financial choicesCNBC|Momentive financial literacy poll: Full results Members of the CNBC CFO Council have mentioned ""a tale of two cities"" among consumers, with higher-income consumers continuing to be strong while lower-income consumers are beginning to chew through the stimulus. There will be a new equilibrium point, and inflation won't grow as it has over the past year, but it will remain at a higher level, and the consumer spending has to be set against this dynamic that will play out through calendar year 2022, and is expected to be more sharply felt in the second half of the year.Key factors that CFOs are watching include the decline in the consumer savings rate; how successful the Fed is in using its tools to slow the economy without pushing it into recession, including raising rates to cool consumption and investment; and greater supply chain stability.The supply chain remains in flux with new Covid variants, as well as the Russian war against Ukraine hitting energy and food prices. But if supply chain pressures overall do ease, inventory will be replenished at a rate that could lead to more pushback from retailers on pricing, as consumers also begin to slow their consumption habits, trading down in certain categories of purchases or trading away from them.The Conference Board's most recent CEO survey showed that companies are passing along the costs of inflation relatively quickly to consumers, and that pattern is likely to continue in the months ahead, with wage gains a contributing factor. ""What we are seeing and hearing from members is that these tight labor market conditions are going to continue for several months, so we will continue to see wage pressure,"" Franco said.As earnings come in, the market will be looking for signs of durable consumer strength amid higher prices. Earlier this week, Conagra's results showed that it couldn't make price increases flow through to its bottom line relative to input costs, but CEO Sean Connolly said Thursday that ""consumer demand has remained strong in the face of our pricing actions to date.""Conagra is planning more price increases."
2022-04-08,"It's not just bond and stock markets that can signal an economic downturn.From the men's underwear index, to the hemline index, there are also a number of more unconventional economic indicators that could be worth monitoring.Fears of a recession have been on the rise recently. Investors have become increasingly concerned that record-high inflation amid the Russia-Ukraine war, coupled with the Federal Reserve's plans to aggressively hike interest rates, could slow economic growth.This deepening sense of unease has been reflected in the U.S. government bond market, through what is known as a yield curve inversion, which has historically occurred prior to recessions. Investors have been selling out of short-dated Treasurys in favor of longer-dated government debt, prompting 2-year bonds yields to rise above the 10-year rate.However, economists have stressed that an inversion in bond yields is by no means a guarantee of a recession. Indeed, this indicator can emerge as much as two years before an economic downturn takes hold.There's a slew of other economic data that can act as recession signals, including employment and consumer spending figures. Market watchers have also turned to more unusual gauges of economic health. British economist Andrew Lawrence developed the so-called ""skyscraper index"" in 1999. The measure links the construction of the world's largest buildings with the onset of an economic crisis.Lawrence said in a 2012 interview with the non-profit Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat that he had looked as far back as the late 1800s and found correlations between the completion of the world's tallest buildings and economic crises.Notable examples include the completion of the Chrysler and Empire State buildings in New York during the Great Depression.Lawrence explained that the completion of these skyscrapers tends to ""cap off what is a large building boom."" However, he pointed out that it's not the tall building itself that is the issue but rather when there is a ""cluster"" of these skyscrapers.In terms of recently completed skyscrapers, Kuala Lumpa's Merdeka 118 tower was completed at the end of 2021 and is the world's second-tallest building. New York's Steinway Tower, said to be the skinniest skyscraper in the world and one of the tallest in the Western hemisphere, has also just been completed. For former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, it's sales of men's underpants.NPR correspondent Robert Krulwich said back in 2008, amid the global financial crisis, that Greenspan had explained to him that because underpants were one of the last pieces of clothing men look to buy, it acts as a good indicator of when times are hard.Greenspan had reportedly said that sales of men's underpants tend to be quite consistent, but dips in sales indicate that men's finances are so stretched they decide to hold off on buying replacements. The ""hemline index"" emerged on the back of a thesis in the 1920s by Wharton Business School economist George Taylor. The theory is that skirts become shorter when markets are on the rise and longer in downturns.The economic exuberance of the 1920s and the appearance of knee-length flapper skirts, along with the emergence of the mini skirt in the 1960s amid stronger financial conditions, have been cited as examples to support this theory.However, there have often been questions raised over its credibility.A study published in 2010 by the Erasmus School of Economics Econometric Institute, in the Netherlands, collected monthly data on hemlines between 1921 and 2009.""The main finding is that the urban legend holds true but with a time lag of about three years,"" the authors of the report said. Estee Lauder Chairman Leonard Lauder developed the ""lipstick index"" amid the economic downturn in 2001. He suggested that women would spend more on small luxuries, like lipstick, as pick-me-ups when times are hard.This theory didn't ring true during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 when sales of makeup declined as consumers were restricted to staying at home during lockdowns.Russ Mould, investment research director at AJ Bell, told CNBC via telephone that while investors should not rely on these soft economic indicators implicitly, they were ""always worth keeping an eye on.""Mould said it was when the prices of luxuries such as champagne and art ""go through the roof"" at the same time as share prices, share buybacks, mergers and acquisitions and debt that investors should start to feel a bit more concerned.""It's a sort of bull market, happy-days-are-gonna-last-forever-type behavior that just can't last forever, because it never does,"" he said.Check out: There are signs a recession could be on the way.

2022-04-11,"The global economy is likely entering a ""war-cession,"" according to veteran investment strategist David Roche, and markets are underestimating it.Roche, president of Independent Strategy, suggested that evidence from Ukraine of atrocities committed by Russian forces prevents any possibility of a swift peace negotiation.""In a normal recession, output and demand go down, inflation goes down. In this sort of a recession, a 'war-cession,' you actually have output which falls at the same time as costs and inflation rise,"" he explained. LONDON — The global economy is likely entering a ""war-cession,"" according to veteran investment strategist David Roche, and markets are underestimating its duration.It comes as markets attempt to navigate a flurry of concurrent economic hurdles, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, soaring inflation, rising interest rates and supply disruption from China's efforts to contain a Covid-19 outbreak.Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday, Roche, president of Independent Strategy, suggested that evidence of atrocities committed against civilians in Ukraine by Russian forces will prevent any possibility of a swift peace negotiation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.As such, the West's only option is to seek regime change in Russia, he said, given that Putin cannot be seen domestically to withdraw from Ukraine without a ""victory.""""He is not going to trade withdrawal for any ratcheting down of sanctions, so the sanctions stay in place and I think the implications for Europe are that you will see recession, because the sanctions will actually increase and move towards a total energy blockade,"" Roche said.EU countries last week agreed to a suite of new sanctions on Russia, in light of reported cases of sexual violence and the torture and executions of civilians, including a full embargo on Russian coal imports. Europe is also considering additional measures including a full embargo on imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel and gas. A rocket attack on a crowded train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk on Friday killed more than 30 people and injured more than 100. It comes after Russian forces switched their assault to eastern Ukraine following their withdrawal from towns around the capital of Kyiv.Ukrainian officials have warned that further atrocities are likely to be uncovered in towns recaptured from retreating Russian soldiers, and Roche argued that investors will no longer be able to separate politics from markets.""This is an enormous supply-side shock that will continue in food, in energy, in metals and I can go on. That will go on while at the same time, we're dealing with inflation worldwide, we're dealing with rising interest rates – I think the 30-year [Treasury yield] will be at least 3.5% in a year's time – and we're looking at, of course, supply disruptions in China due to what is happening on Covid, which people are not talking about, but which are obviously another supply side to the global system,"" he said. Roche suggested that this will be too much for stock markets to overcome in order to continue grinding higher, and argued that historically high inflation will not fall off as economic growth slows, as would ordinarily be the case in a normal recession.""In a normal recession, output and demand go down, inflation goes down. In this sort of a recession, a 'war-cession,' you actually have output which falls at the same time as costs and inflation rise,"" he explained.""You're seeing that in the mismatch in the labor market, you're seeing that in the price of commodities, and I think that will continue to push through, so you're faced with a very strange situation where central banks have to choose between their inflation target and growth.""Investors have been closely monitoring central bank comments to assess the likely pace of monetary policy tightening as policymakers try to contain inflation, but Roche suggested any talk of policy rates going ""over the hump"" in the coming years is ""premature.""""When the pain does become extreme on the output and performance, growth side of the economy, of course they will slip back, but I think it's going to take a lot longer to happen than the equity market assumes,"" he said."
2022-04-11,"Few areas of the country have seen inflation as bad as in the South, where prices have risen across the 16-state region by an average of 8.4% from a year ago.But prices aren't the only thing heating up in the South and West, as Georgia and Arizona voters find themselves in a fierce 2022 midterm election cycle.Some residents say rising food, gasoline and housing costs are likely to play a factor in how they vote later this year.The Labor Department's March 2022 CPI consumer price report is due out Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Matthew Rice doesn't have to look hard for signs of inflation in Savannah, Georgia.A gallon of gas cost $2.79 a few months ago, he said. Now it runs him more than $4.""And, of course, when the price of gas goes up, the price of products goes up,"" the 45-year-old added. ""So yeah. It's played a role in our household.""Rice, a longtime fan of MLB's Atlanta Braves and a graduate of Armstrong State University, now known as Georgia Southern University, is one of the tens of thousands of Americans who say rising prices are straining their household budgets and shaping how they think about this year's elections.Gradual but steady jumps in the costs of groceries, housing and gas have forced consumers like Rice, who manages reservations for an RV park on nearby Tybee Island, to change how they spend money.While his work has been busy as more Americans take long-delayed vacations following Covid pandemic-era shutdowns, Rice said inflation has made him choosier when he, his mother and 10-year-old daughter shop for groceries every other Friday. ""We have, at times, made substitutions based off what's available because of the supply chain,"" he said. ""And at times, due to the price, we maybe try other brands of products that we normally would not have tried before.""Few areas of the country have seen inflation as bad as in the South, where prices have risen across the 16-state region by an average of 8.4% from a year ago. That compares with year-over-year inflation of 8% in the Midwest, 8.1% in the West and 6.6% in the Northeast, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Inflation is particularly bad in Tampa, Florida, Miami and Atlanta where consumer prices have jumped by an average of 9.6%, 9.8% and a whopping 10.6%, respectively, over the last year.But prices aren't the only thing heating up in the South and West, as Georgia again finds itself in the middle of a fierce election cycle. Inflation has vaulted to the top of the minds of both voters and candidates across the state.At the federal level, several Republicans hope to unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who defeated Republican Kelly Loeffler in a special election in 2020. Loeffler was appointed in 2019 by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to finish the term of former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned for health reasons.Warnock is Georgia's first Black senator, and his win gave Democrats a razor-thin majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, the state's gubernatorial race pits Kemp against fellow Republican and former Sen. David Perdue, who's been endorsed by former President Donald Trump.In an already bitter primary competition, Perdue hopes to tap into Georgia Republicans' frustrations with Kemp after the governor refused to overturn the 2020 election results that favored then-candidate Joe Biden. Trump falsely claimed widespread fraud led to Biden's win, and asked the state's top elections official to ""find"" enough votes for him to reverse his loss.The GOP winner is all but certain to face another tough challenger in the November general election from Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the 2018 governor's race to Kemp.But as different as Georgia's candidates and elections are, voters are unified by their shared fatigue over rising sticker prices for gasoline, groceries and housing.For the past several months, Labor Department data has shown that year-over-year price jumps have been hitting levels not seen since the Ronald Reagan administration. In its most recent update last month, the department said its benchmark consumer inflation index rose 7.9% over the last 12 months, the hottest reading since January 1982.The Labor Department's March 2022 consumer price report is due out on Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET.Those familiar with the White House's thinking say the administration expects to see a hot headline March CPI figure given that the prior print failed to fully capture a dramatic uptick in petroleum prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began in late February.The CPI, or consumer price index, is the department's tool for measuring the price changes of a basket of goods and services that everyday Americans buy each month.Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy prices, could be more modest by comparison in the March report. The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank tasked with keeping prices stable, considers inflation around 2% a healthy byproduct of economic growth. But too much can signal overheating and a disconnect between the economy's broadest forces of supply and demand.For consumers, unruly inflation can erode what economists call purchasing power, or the total quantity of goods and services they can buy at their current income.But as fast as prices rise in Savannah, Rice said some grocery purchases aren't up for debate.""We try not to make too many adjustments because my daughter — she likes certain brands,"" he laughed, saying they can't substitute cheaper brands for Kraft Macaroni & Cheese or Quaker Oats' Peaches & Cream flavored instant oatmeal among his daughter's favorites. ""Kids usually have a certain taste."" Economists say the country's inflation woes began in the spring of 2021 as Covid vaccines arrived and then was exacerbated by a variety of seemingly unrelated factors.The inoculations stoked demand for all the things consumers gave up to stay safe during the worst of the pandemic — travel and dining out. Demand also surged for new cars, paid for in part with all the money saved by staying in for months.Factory shutdowns during the pandemic left automakers like Ford and General Motors behind on production. The surge in demand, combined with a shortage of computer chips, further reduced vehicle inventory and sent prices soaring on cars and electronics.

Tim Scott of South Carolina files paperwork to run for presidentG-7 leaders commit to more Russia sanctions with Ukraine's Zelenskyy set to attend summit Labor shortages — due in part to people calling out sick with Covid or quarantining because of an exposure — led to freight backlogs at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, and higher shipping costs that were passed on to consumers.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent oil prices spiking, and soaring real estate values have driven up the cost of housing.Caroline Fohlin, an economics professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said Arizona and Georgia are both seeing steep home price jumps as people leave the country's largest cities for cheaper locales. The pandemic opened up the prospects of working from home — from anywhere — for city dwellers who could buy expansive homes with yards for the cost of a one-bedroom apartment in New York or San Francisco.Online listing website Apartment List shows that Atlanta rents climbed by about 18% over 2021, with the average per-month cost for a one-bedroom apartment at $1,831.""They're moving in droves to places like Savannah, Charleston – you know, the coastal South,"" Fohlin said. ""Take a look at the real estate market in, say, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina"" where ""shacks"" are selling for millions.""That's great news for the old-timers who are able to sell their previously $50,000 shacks for $3 million,"" she said. Roger Ferguson, former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, attributed most of the rise in consumer prices in Georgia and Arizona to the increase in housing costs.""There might be some differences in terms of your labor force, compensation composition,"" Ferguson, a CNBC contributor, said last month. ""But my hypothesis is that it's primarily around housing.""In New York City, where renters comprise about 67% of all households, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment fell from about $1,920 per month in February 2020 to $1,510 by January 2021 as residents fled congested cities, according to Apartment List.Rents have more than rebounded since then as bosses increasingly insist on workers returning to their offices. The monthly cost of a one-bedroom apartment in New York City is now around $2,068. The mismatch between supply and demand, and the resulting inflation, has blossomed into a critical issue for Biden and Democrats hoping to retain control of Congress this year.Nearly 1 in 5 Americans, 17%, said in March that inflation is the most important problem facing the U.S., according to polling site Gallup. That figure represents a 7 percentage point climb from the 10% of Americans who in February said inflation was the country's chief headache. As inflation has climbed, Biden's polling has fallen: Just 36% of those surveyed by Gallup in a recent poll say they approve of his handling of the economy, down from 54% in February 2021.Republicans hoping to win back control of Congress have seized on rising prices as evidence of economic mismanagement and frivolous spending by Democrats, who control the White House and both chambers of Congress. They have focused on the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, the Democratic coronavirus relief law passed in March 2021, as vaccines were starting to boost demand in the U.S.One such Republican is former pro football player Herschel Walker, who's running against Warnock in Georgia's Senate race. Walker, a longtime Trump ally, echoed the frustrations of many Georgia Republicans earlier this year when he shared on Twitter an image of a near-barren grocery store shelf and blamed Democrats' economic agenda for the frothy inflation.""Our shelves are empty, the supply chain is a mess, and inflation is at the HIGHEST in 40 years,"" Walker wrote in a Jan. 19 Twitter post. ""President Biden's approval ratings continue to drop. Why is he focused on social spending? People just want affordable gas and groceries on the shelves!""Democrats attribute the price spikes to a combination of overwhelmed supply chains, the war in Ukraine, labor shortages and unprecedented demand. Warnock specifically has met opponents' inflation barbs by blaming corporate profiteering.""While corporations are seeing record profits, Georgia consumers are seeing record prices,"" Warnock said in a Twitter post from February. ""Whether it's working to ease supply chain issues, or capping out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, I'm fighting for hardworking Georgians every day."" Across the country in Arizona, prices have also affected consumer spending — and the political landscape.Aaron Spector, a 28-year-old Tempe resident, said his landlord's move to hike rent by nearly 20% led him to make some changes — he bought his own home.""Honestly, it just didn't make sense to rent anymore with the increase that I was seeing,"" Spector, who works in sales for a logistics firm, told CNBC. ""I did want to buy a house – it was on the timeline. But it was definitely expedited – almost necessary – when I saw what the rent was increasing to.""In nearby Phoenix, Kevin McElwain said signs of housing cost hikes are everywhere.McElwain, who works sourcing labor and materials for homebuilders, said more expensive raw materials are fueling prices for new homes.""Anything from framing, concrete, electrical – you name it. Prices have risen probably by at least 50%,"" he said. A lot of the problem, he explained, comes from shortages of supply for workers and raw commodities.""You have people that will turn down bids for new projects because either they don't have the necessary parts and materials, or they don't have the crews,"" McElwain, 29, said. Those shortages are likely a main culprit in Phoenix's high prices, which have risen 10.9% over the last 12 months. Over the last year in the city, meat prices have jumped 16.2%, clothing costs have climbed 15.5% and restaurant bills are up 5.9%.Spector said that inflation, and the state of the economy more broadly, will influence him at the ballot box come Election Day.""It will definitely impact how I vote,"" the graduate of the State University of New York at Geneseo said. ""It will obviously have an impact. When people's bank accounts are affected like this, it changes people's minds.""Phoenix resident McElwain, who said he's not registered to vote with either party, said inflation is on his mind this election year.""I'd like to see it be addressed by the candidates that are running,"" he continued. ""But I'm still going to take everything that they have to say with a grain of salt one way or the other."" Votes from McElwain and Spector this fall will help determine whether Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly will hold on to the seat he won in Arizona's 2020 special election against then-GOP incumbent Martha McSally to finish out the remainder of former Sen. John McCain's term.Like Warnock, Kelly has tried to convince voters that he and his fellow Democrats are working to check unruly prices.The retired astronaut in March detailed ""6 Things"" he is doing to try to cool inflation in Arizona. Those efforts include a bill to suspend the federal gas tax for the rest of 2022, his contributions to the CHIPS semiconductor bill and a deal to cap out-of-pocket prescription costs for seniors.""We're in the middle of a global microchip shortage that's driving up prices on everything from cars to appliances,"" Kelly said in a Twitter post April 2. ""Our bill to boost U.S. microchip manufacturing will help end that shortage, create thousands of high-paying jobs for Arizonans, and grow our state's economy.""The strain soaring inflation has put on Americans — and the anxiety it has caused incumbents running this fall — has shown up repeatedly in the policy choices made by swing-state lawmakers this year. On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., named both Kelly and Warnock to a conference committee that will hash out a final microchip bill with House members.Both senators have also tried to show voters they can address an issue that has vexed Rice in Georgia and people across the U.S.: high gas prices. Kelly and Warnock co-sponsored legislation that would suspend the U.S. gas tax for the rest of the year. The bill has not moved forward since senators unveiled it in February.""This bill will lower gas prices by suspending the federal gas tax through the end of the year to help Arizona families struggling with high costs for everything from gas to groceries,"" Kelly said in a statement at the time.Warnock added in his own statement: ""Hardworking Georgians being squeezed at the pump understand that every penny counts.""Correction: Quaker Oats has a Peaches & Cream flavored instant oatmeal. An earlier version misstated the name of the product. "
2022-04-12,"Official measures of producer and consumer prices in China rose in March by more than analysts expected, according to data released Monday.""Rising food and energy price inflation limits the space for the PBoC to cut interest rates, despite the rapidly worsening economy,"" Nomura's chief China economist Ting Lu and a team said in a note.The yield on China's 10-year government bond fell below that of the U.S. for the first time in 12 years on Monday, according to Reuters. BEIJING — Persistent inflation in China narrows the window for when the People's Bank of China can cut interest rates and support growth, economists said.Official measures of producer and consumer prices in China rose in March by more than analysts expected, according to data released Monday.""Rising food and energy price inflation limits the space for the PBoC to cut interest rates, despite the rapidly worsening economy,"" Nomura's chief China economist Ting Lu and a team said in a note Monday.Lu referred to his team's report earlier this month that noted how China's 1-year benchmark deposit rate is only slightly above the rate of consumer price increases. That reduces the relative value of Chinese bank deposits.On an international level, higher U.S. interest rates narrows the gap between the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield and its Chinese counterpart, reducing the relative attractiveness of Chinese bonds. Cutting rates in China would reduce that gap further.The yield on China's 10-year government bond fell below that of the U.S. for the first time in 12 years on Monday, according to Reuters. Previously the Chinese bond yield tended to trade at a 100 to 200 basis point premium to the U.S. ""We think April could be the last chance for China to have a rate cut in the near term before [the] Fed's potential balance sheet shrink,"" said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance.Fed meeting minutes released last week showed how policymakers generally agreed to reduce the central bank's holdings of bonds, likely starting in May, at about double the rate prior to the pandemic.The U.S. consumer price index out overnight showed prices rose by 8.5% in March from a year ago, the fastest pace since December 1981. Food, energy and airline fares saw some of the biggest increases in price.China's consumer price index rose by 1.5% in March, up from 0.9% in February and the fastest since consumer prices rose by the same pace in December, Wind data showed. A sharp, 41.4% year-on-year decline in pork prices continued to drag down food inflation. Vegetable prices rose by 17.2%.""Rising inflation, if [it] continues, could further limit China's room for policy maneuvers,"" Pang said.He noted how Chinese investors increasingly expect the PBOC to act after high-level government comments this month.China will adjust monetary policy ""when appropriate"" to support growth, Premier Li Keqiang said at a meeting last week of the State Council, the top executive body. The producer price index rose by 8.3% in March, slower than the 8.8% increase in February and the lowest since April 2021, according to Wind data. Coal and petroleum products contributed some of the largest gains.Within the consumer price index, the largest increase was in transportation fuel, up by 24.1% year-on-year in March. The global price of oil has surged since the Russia-Ukraine war began in late February.""China's inflation dynamics implied a continued margin pressure on Chinese corporates,"" said Bruce Liu, Beijing-based CEO of Esoterica Capital, an asset manager.""March inflation was not the only force that brought down Chinese equity markets [on Monday], and the rising-real-yield-induced equity sell-off last Friday in the U.S. spilled over,"" Liu said. ""More Covid worries in multiple places outside Shanghai (Guangzhou, Beijing, etc.) also weighed on market sentiment, and investors got their hands full at the moment.""The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed to a three-year high Friday and rose further overnight on Monday to 2.793%, its highest since January 2019. China's 10-year government bond yield held around 2.8075% Tuesday, according to Wind Information.

2022-04-12,"Headline CPI in March rose by 8.5% from a year ago, the fastest annual gain since December 1981 and one-tenth of a percentage point above the estimate.Surging food, energy and shelter costs helped account for the gain.Real worker earnings fell by another 0.8% during the month as the cost of living outpaced otherwise strong pay gains. Prices that consumers pay for everyday items surged in March to their highest levels since the early days of the Reagan administration, according to Labor Department data released Tuesday.The consumer price index, which measures a wide-ranging basket of goods and services, jumped 8.5% from a year ago on an unadjusted basis, above even the already elevated Dow Jones estimate for 8.4%.Excluding food and energy, so-called core CPI increased 6.5% on a 12-month basis, in line with the expectation. However, there were signs that core inflation appeared to be ebbing, as it rose just 0.3% for the month, less than the 0.5% estimate. That in turn sparked some hope that inflation overall was easing and that March might represent the peak.Markets reacted positively to the report as stocks rose and government bond yields declined.""The big news in the March report was that core price pressures finally appear to be moderating,"" wrote Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Hunter said he thinks the March increase will ""mark the peak"" for inflation as year-over-year comparisons drive the numbers lower and energy prices subside.Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the slowing increase in core CPI is a ""welcome"" development in the effort to bring down inflation.""""I'll be looking to see whether we continue to see moderation in the months ahead,"" Brainard told the Wall Street Journal.The data reflected price rises not seen in the U.S. since the stagflation days of the late 1970s and early '80s. March's headline reading in fact was the highest since December 1981. Core inflation was the hottest since August 1982.Due to the surge in inflation, worker wages, despite rising 5.6% from a year ago, weren't keeping pace with the cost of living. Real average hourly earnings posted a seasonally adjusted 0.8% decline for the month, according to a separate Bureau of Labor Statistics report.The inability of wages to keep up with costs could add to inflation pressures. The Atlanta Federal Reserve wage tracker for March indicated gains of another 6% which is ""symptomatic of inflation pressures continuing to broaden,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. Coulton pointed out that the core inflation deceleration was due largely to a drop in auto prices, while other prices continued to show increases.Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, increased another 0.5% on the month, making the 12-month gain a blistering 5%, the highest since May 1991.To combat inflation, the Fed has begun raising interest rates and is expected to continue doing so through the remainder of the year and into 2023. The last time prices were this high, the Fed raised its benchmark rate to nearly 20%, pulling the economy into a recession that finally defeated inflation.Economists generally don't expect a recession this time around, though many on Wall Street are raising the probability of a downturn.""Overall, this report is encouraging, at the margin, though it is far too soon to be sure that the next few core prints will be as low; much depends on the path of used vehicle prices, which is very hard to forecast with confidence,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""We're sure they will fall, but the speed of the decline is what matters.""Price increases came from many of the usual culprits.Food rose 1% for the month and 8.8% over the year, as prices for goods such as rice, ground beef, citrus fruits and fresh vegetables all posted gains of more than 2% in March. Energy prices were up 11% and 32%, respectively, as gasoline prices popped 18.3% for the month, boosted by the war in Ukraine and the pressure it is exerting on supply.One sector that has been a major driver in the inflation burst subsided in March. Used car and truck prices declined 3.8% for the month, though they are still up 35.3% on the year. Also, commodity prices excluding food and energy fell by 0.4%.Those declines, however, were offset by gains in clothing, services excluding energy and medical care, each of which increased 0.6% for the month. Transportation services also rose 2%, bringing its 12-month gain to 7.7%.In a sign of economic recovery from a sector hard-hit during the Covid pandemic, airline fares jumped by 10.7% in the month and were up 23.6% from a year ago."
2022-04-12,"Inflation is quickly raising prices for households in core areas of their monthly budgets — energy, food and housing. That's making it hard for consumers to avoid a financial hit, even as wages are also rising at their fastest clip in years.But there are levers Americans can pull — relative to their jobs, investments and spending — that may help, according to financial advisors.""I liken the situation to being out at sea in a tiny little boat in the midst of a horrible storm,"" said Andy Baxley, a Chicago-based certified financial planner at The Planning Center. ""You just have to control what you can control.More from Invest in You:As inflation rises, where to find opportunities to make and save moneyYour financial wrap-up: 4 savvy money moves to make before year-endHere's what Americans plan to cut as prices continue to rise""You can't control the storm or ocean, but you can control what you're doing on your little boat.""The Consumer Price Index jumped 8.5% in March 2022 from a year earlier, the fastest 12-month increase since December 1981, the U.S. Department of Labor said Tuesday.The index is a gauge of rising prices across a swath of U.S. goods and services. A basket of items that cost $100 a year ago would cost $108.50 today, on average.Gasoline, shelter and food were the biggest contributors to rising costs last month, the Labor Department said. Those categories have a big impact on the typical American: Housing, transportation and food accounted for almost two-thirds of the average household budget in 2020.""Households are having to make very difficult [financial] decisions day in and day out,"" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said of inflation. Specifically, ""food at home"" prices (i.e., grocery bills) are up 10% over the last 12 months, the biggest annual increase since March 1981. Costs were up across all major food categories, the Labor Department said.Shelter costs such as rent, meanwhile, rose 5% in the past year, the fastest annual pace since May 1991.And household energy costs such as electricity and natural gas rose 11.1% and 21.6%, respectively, in the last year. Meanwhile, prices at the pump are up 48%. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a big contributor to inflation in March, especially for gasoline prices. (Gasoline accounted for more than half of overall inflation last month, though prices have fallen recently as oil prices have come down.)Russia and Ukraine are also big agricultural exporters, and their conflict likely plays at least a small role in higher food prices, McBride said.But inflation had been high even before the war in Europe, a function of demand outstripping supply since the U.S. economy ramped up in early 2021.  Initially, consumers had lots of money to spend and global supply chains couldn't keep up.That dynamic is still present, as Covid cases abroad cause lockdowns and halt production, for example. Labor supply also hasn't yet fully recovered, and businesses have raised wages to compete for workers; they may pass those labor costs on to consumers via higher prices, for example.Some economists are optimistic inflation peaked last month. So-called ""core"" inflation figures (which strip out the volatile food and energy categories) fell for the second consecutive month, perhaps an early sign of a broader deceleration.""There seem to be clear signs of a slowdown there,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But it's likely to remain high by past standards for the next year to 18 months because the economy is so strong.""There are a few steps households can take to blunt inflation's financial impact. For one, high prices may be eclipsing some good news for workers: The job market is hot. Job openings are near record highs, layoffs are near historic lows, and employers are raising wages quickly.Instead of focusing on how much more money is being spent due to inflation, workers can use their newfound leverage to make more money, Baxley said.Workers should ask for a raise or hunt for a higher-paying job if their employer is unwilling to pay that raise, Baxley said. This is also a good time to negotiate work-related costs — for example, asking to work from home more often can reduce transportation time and, therefore, gasoline expenses.Taking home thousands of extra dollars in a paycheck will likely have a much bigger impact on a consumer's bottom line than other still useful actions such as buying generic brands instead of ""premium"" counterparts.""Power has shifted to employees in a major way,"" Baxley said. ""Take advantage of this rare moment to make sure you're getting what you're worth."" Second, consumers saving for a purchase in the next two to three years (maybe a car or a down payment on a home) can buy ""I bonds.""These nearly risk-free investments pay a rate that rises and falls according to the Consumer Price Index and therefore protects the purchasing power of consumers' savings, Baxley said. Investors can save up to $10,000 a year. This should be a bucket separate from emergency savings, since I bonds lock up your money for at least a year, Baxley added. Lastly, consumers should examine how they're spending money to gauge their personal inflation rate, Baxley said. (Online calculators can help determine this rate.)The Consumer Price Index is a national average that may not reflect an individual's situation such as their wage growth and household expenses. Households that use public transit may be insulated from high gas prices, just as vegetarians might also be from the higher relative cost of meat and poultry.""Figure out how inflation is hurting your household the most,"" Baxley said. ""Then you can start to look for substitutes and replacements.""SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

2022-04-13,"Recent years have seen companies like GE, Vestas and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy announce plans to develop huge wind turbines.The sheer scale of these turbines may pose a number of mid-to-long term challenges for the sector.Huge turbines are being designed at a time when countries around the world are laying out plans to expand wind energy capacity. In the not too distant future, waters 15 miles off Martha's Vineyard will be home to a potentially crucial part of America's energy future: the 800-megawatt Vineyard Wind 1, a project that's been described as ""the nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm.""Construction of Vineyard Wind 1 started last year, and the facility will use 13 MW versions of GE Renewable Energy's Haliade-X turbines. With a height of up to 260 meters (853 feet), a rotor diameter of 220 meters and 107-meter blades, the Haliade-X is part of a new generation of turbines set to be installed in the years ahead.In addition to GE, other companies are getting in on the big turbine act. In Aug. 2021, China's MingYang Smart Energy released details of a 264-meter tall design that will use 118-meter blades.Elsewhere, Danish firm Vestas is working on a 15-megawatt turbine that will have a rotor diameter of 236 meters and 115.5-meter blades while Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy is developing a turbine that incorporates 108-meter blades and a rotor diameter of 222 meters.The reasons for these increases in size are clear. When it comes to height, the U.S. Department of Energy says the towers of turbines ""are becoming taller to capture more energy, since winds generally increase as altitudes increase.""

This global stock with 55% upside offers uranium price exposure, BoA says A bigger rotor diameter isn't just for show either, with the DOE noting that they ""allow wind turbines to sweep more area, capture more wind, and produce more electricity.""It's much the same with blades. The DOE says longer blades can ""capture more of the available wind than shorter blades—even in areas with relatively less wind.""Having huge turbines arrive on the market is all well and good, but their sheer scale may pose a number of mid-to-long term challenges for the sector, creating pinch points that could cause headaches.ShipshapeTake installations. In February, research from Rystad Energy honed in on some of the possible issues related to the ships used to install offshore wind turbines out at sea.Not counting China, it said wind turbines had seen what it called ""a growth spurt in recent years, rising from an average of 3 megawatts (MW) in 2010 to 6.5 MW today.""This shift, it explained, was likely to be sustained. ""Turbines larger than 8 MW accounted for just 3% of global installations between 2010 and 2021, but that percentage is forecast to surge to 53% by 2030.""The above data relates to offshore wind turbines only. According to the energy research and business intelligence firm, demand for vessels able to install larger offshore turbines is set to outstrip supply by the year 2024.Operators, it said, ""will have to invest in new vessels or upgrade existing ones to install the super-sized turbines that are expected to become the norm by the end of the decade, or the pace of offshore wind installations could slow down."" ""When turbines were smaller, installation could be handled by the first-generation fleet of offshore wind vessels or converted jackups from the oil and gas industry,"" Martin Lysne, senior analyst for rigs and vessels at Rystad Energy, said in a statement at the time.With operators continuing to favor bigger turbines, Lysne said a ""new generation of purpose-built vessels"" would be needed to satisfy demand.These specialized vessels don't come cheap. U.S. firm Dominion Energy, for example, is heading up a consortium building the 472-foot Charybdis, which will cost around $500 million and be able to install current turbines and next-generation ones of 12 MW or greater. More vessels like the Charybdis will be needed in the future as turbines grow.""Out of the current fleet of purpose-built vessels, only a handful of units can install 10 MW+ turbines, and none are currently able to install 14 MW+ turbines,"" according to Rystad Energy's analysis. ""This will change towards 2025 as newbuilds start to be delivered and existing vessels get crane upgrades."" PortsThe ships that transport and install turbines will be important in the years ahead, but the ports where they dock are another area where investment and upgrades will likely be needed to cater to wind energy's growth.In a comment sent to CNBC via email, Rystad Energy's Lysne described port infrastructure as being ""very important"" from a vessel perspective. Going forward, it would appear that a lot of money will be needed. Last May, a report from industry body WindEurope said Europe's ports would have to invest 6.5 billion euros (around $7.07 billion) by 2030 in order ""to support the expansion of offshore wind.""The report addressed the new reality of bigger turbines and the effect this could have in relation to ports and infrastructure. ""Upgraded or entirely new facilities are needed to host larger turbines and a larger market,"" it said.Ports, WindEurope said, would also need to ""expand their land, reinforce quays, enhance their deep-sea harbours and carry out other civil works.""

In relation to ports, Rystad Energy's Lysne told CNBC that the U.S. — whose current offshore wind market is small — would ""require more work as they do not have the same infrastructure in place as Europe.""Change on that front does appear to be forthcoming. At the beginning of March, BP and Equinor — two businesses better known as oil and gas producers — signed an agreement to convert the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal into an offshore wind port.In an announcement, Equinor said the port would become ""a cutting-edge staging facility for Equinor and bp's Empire Wind and Beacon Wind projects."" The site, it claimed, would be ""a go-to destination for future offshore wind projects in the region."" Investment in infrastructure upgrades is expected to come in at $200 to $250 million.The road aheadAll of the above feeds into the importance of infrastructure and logistics. Shashi Barla, who is global head of wind supply chain and technology at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC that while companies had the technological capabilities, logistical challenges were proving to be ""very difficult.""""It's not that it is something new … we have been talking about logistics challenges since day one of the industry,"" Barla said. ""It's that ... we are kind of now, today, approaching the tipping point.""Around the world, major economies are announcing plans to ramp up wind energy capacity in a bid to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. While these goals are ambitious, it's clear they face a number of hurdles. Notwithstanding the issues related to turbine size, it will require a gargantuan effort to bring all these installations online. There's work to be done.   ""Increasingly, a lack of facilitating infrastructure is seen as a major limiting factor in the wind industry's growth,"" the GWEC's report noted.""In many countries,"" it added, ""lack of infrastructure, such as grid and transmission networks, logistics highways and ports, is curtailing the expansion of wind power and stifling the very innovation needed to transform the energy system.""Alongside these issues, wind turbines' interaction with wildlife is likely to be another area of major debate and discussion going forward.Only last week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that a firm called ESI Energy Inc had ""pled guilty to three counts of violating the MBTA,"" or Migratory Bird Treaty Act.As the 21st century progresses, wind energy is set for a massive expansion, but the road ahead looks far from smooth. With the U.N. secretary-general recently warning the planet was ""sleepwalking to climate catastrophe,"" the stakes couldn't be much higher."
2022-04-13," President Joe Biden’s approval rating slid to a new low of 38%, according to CNBC’s All-America Survey.His approval rating on the economy dropped for a fourth consecutive survey.As inflation rises, 47% of participants say the economy is “poor,” the highest number in that category since 2012. Americans harbor some of the most downbeat views on the economy since the recovery from the Great Recession, and some of their attitudes are in line with those seen only during recessions, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey.Amid soaring inflation, 47% of the public say the economy is ""poor,"" the highest number in that category since 2012. Only 17% rank the economy as excellent or good, the lowest since 2014.Only one in five Americans describe their personal financial situation as ""getting ahead,"" the weakest showing in eight years. Most say they are ""remaining in place,"" and one in 10 say they are ""falling backward."" Meanwhile, 56% say they expect a recession in the next year — a level only achieved in the survey during an actual recession. ""The angst was previously more about what was going to happen in the economy, and we've now shifted into a new place where we're much more much pessimistic about what's currently happening,"" said Micah Roberts, a partner at Public Opinion Strategies and the Republican pollster for the survey. ""There's no overwriting the pessimism in this survey. It is on every page, and it is inescapable.""The survey of 800 Americans nationwide was conducted April 7 through April 10 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. The pessimism is clearly dragging on Americans' opinions of President Joe Biden. In fact, nothing looks to be working in the Biden presidency from the public's viewpoint.The president's approval rating sank to a new low of just 38%, with 53% disapproving. Biden's -15% net approval rating is measurably worse than his -9% approval in the CNBC December survey. What's more, his approval rating on the economy dropped for a fourth straight survey to just 35%, with 60% disapproving, putting the president a deep 25 points underwater. The president also saw double-digit declines, on a year-over-year basis, in economic approval among key constituencies who helped to put him in office: women aged 18-49, people of color and young Americans aged 18-35.The president's handling of the war in Ukraine barely fares better with 40% approving and 49% disapproving. His new proposal to tax unrealized gains splits the country in half with 43% in favor and exactly as many opposed to the measure. Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research and the Democratic pollster for the survey, said the problem for Biden is that the inflation issue is bipartisan.""Cost of living has just blown everything else, including Covid, out of the water. And part of the reason for that is, there are attitudes about the economy that are largely a partisan phenomenon,'' he said. ""That is not the case with inflation, or at least not right now. It is the top issue for Democrats, independents and Republicans."" Inflation was chosen by 48% of participants as the top one or two issues facing the country, up 9 points from October. The war in Ukraine came in second place with 31%, followed by immigration and border security, jobs, crime and climate change. The coronavirus, which not long ago was by the far the most important issue, came in at just 14%.There's plenty of blame to go around when it comes to inflation and seemingly almost no one is spared, except for maybe former President Donald Trump.Indeed, 69% of the public blame supply chain disruption, while 66% say it's the result of corporations taking advantage of the situation. Meanwhile, 55% point to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and 49% blame Biden's policies. Just over three in 10 participants say it's the Federal Reserve and 28% cite President Trump's policies.Meanwhile, Americans are economizing like never before because of higher prices with 84% cutting back on spending in some form to make ends meet.Some 62% reported reducing entertainment spending like going to movies, concerts and restaurants, while majorities also said they are traveling or driving less and dipping into savings. Just 16% said they've been motivated by higher gas prices to buy an electric car.The only good news comes for homeowners. Just over half of participants (52%) expect their home prices will rise in the next year, the highest level since 2017. That optimism could be challenged, however, in coming months by higher mortgage rates. Some 37% see their wages rising by an average of 5% over the next 12 months, the best number since 2019. Unfortunately, 82% see their cost of living going up."

Many goods are stuck in China right now as a result of the Covid lockdowns and it could become a ""big problem"" for the global economy, according to business consultant Richard Martin.""Many of the things that we use around the world that're manufactured, have components from China and we're about to see a logistics snarl that'll dwarf anything in 2020 or 2021,"" Martin, managing director at IMA Asia, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Tuesday.""China is 20% of global demand but its role in supply chains is much bigger than that.""Since the early months of the pandemic, the global economy has struggled with supply chain challenges due to a mix of factors — such as logistics services struggling to keep up with trade volume, or Covid surges in parts of Asia that threatened to disrupt the flow of goods.The war in Ukraine, which broke out in late February after Russia invaded the country, has further fueled those concerns.""The outlook you've got for the global economy is getting pretty dim now — Europe faces a war on its doorstep, United States has got big interest rate hikes coming through which could hit the U.S. consumer and in China, they're really slowing the economy down,"" Martin said. China has in the last few weeks been battling its most severe Covid outbreak on the mainland since the initial shock of the pandemic in early 2020.""China is very vulnerable right now,"" said Rob Subbaraman, chief economist and head of global markets Research for Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.Referring to Nomura's survey on the extent of the lockdowns across China, he said: ""If we look at provinces where there's partial or full lockdowns we estimate it covers around 40% … of China's GDP."" The city of Shanghai is among the places that have been hardest hit, as local authorities put in place strict stay-home measures and travel restrictions. The northern province of Jilin, home to many automobile factories, has also been badly hit though infections appear to be starting to level out.""The problem Beijing has got is right across the country — not just Shanghai but down in the south in Guangzhou and of course, up in Jilin where there's been a lot of manufacturing,"" Martin said.Local officials are ""closing down entire cities"" due to fear of punishment from Beijing if there's a Covid outbreak in their jurisdictions, he added.Supply disruptions are happening at a increasingly rapid rate right now, Subbaraman said. ""We think China's retail sales will probably fall outright in March, China is looking extremely weak right now and really needs more policy stimulus,"" he added.

2022-04-14,"""In the sequence of priorities, we have now put inflation before growth. Time is appropriate to prioritize inflation ahead of growth,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das told reporters on April 9.Inflation will continue to trend higher and remain above the RBI's 2% to 6% target over the next 12 months, predicted Sonal Varma, Nomura's chief economist for India and Asia. Inflation in India is up sharply and signs point to a continuing upward trend, analysts told CNBC.Figures released by India's Statistics Ministry on Tuesday show retail inflation rose 6.95% in March from a year ago. That marked the third consecutive month that retail inflation breached the central bank's upper tolerance margin of 6%. The Modi government has mandated the Reserve Bank of India keep retail inflation at 4%, with a margin of 2%, for a five-year period ending March 2026.Last week, India's central bank revised its inflation forecast upwards — from 4.5% to 5.7% — for the current fiscal year ending March 2023. The RBI also signaled it would pivot from supporting economic growth to containing inflation. ""In the sequence of priorities, we have now put inflation before growth. Time is appropriate to prioritize inflation ahead of growth,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das told reporters on April 9. The RBI also lowered India's economic growth forecast for the current fiscal year from 7.8% to 7.2%, citing escalating geopolitical tensions. Inflation will continue to trend higher and remain above the RBI's 2% to 6% target over the next 12 months, predicted Sonal Varma, Nomura's chief economist for India and Asia.""Policy rates are ultra accommodative.

The rise in inflation was anticipated, chief economic advisor to the Indian government V. Anantha Nageswaran told CNBC.""The central bank has very clearly signaled that it is now committed to prioritizing inflation containment rather than to supporting growth,"" he said. Nageswaran also said the government had taken measures like reducing import duties on palm oil imports to help combat food inflation.""But we should not forget that what we are dealing with is a global phenomenon,"" Nageswaran told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Wednesday.Sign of a 'maturing' economyAsked if the government would reduce taxes on fuel to offset rising crude prices, he said the government will monitor the situation for now.""If prices sustain at high levels for a quarter or two or longer, beyond $110 [a barrel], there has to be some sort of burden-sharing between the government and households,"" he said, though he added fuel consumption should come down through wider use of public transport. Nageswaran said the current anxiety over inflation was a sign of a maturing economy.""The fact that India is now getting exercised about inflation rates that are around 6% to 7% is a sign of a maturing of the Indian economy… because earlier, India's average inflation rate used to be around 7% for the best of five decades or so, until 2010. But the fact that now we are getting very concerned about 7% as a sort of a big inflation rate shows that expectations are indeed shifting."""
2022-04-14,"To boost its economy, Indonesia wants to move away from exporting raw materials, to focus instead on developing its downstream industries.Downstream activities involve processing raw materials into finished products to provide added value. For instance, crude oil can be refined into petroleum, diesel and plastics.Indonesia hopes to transform raw nickel into higher end products like lithium batteries for electric cars — a move the country's investment board said will eventually bring economic growth. Indonesia may be rich in mineral resources, but its mining sector contributes only a fraction to the country's economy. It's something the country is looking to change.related investing newsUBS sees a big gain for this chemical stock as lithium prices in China stabilizeBrian Evans20 hours agoThe Southeast Asian nation boasts of natural deposits including tin, nickel, cobalt and bauxite — some of which are important raw materials for electric vehicle production.Despite large exports, the mineral and coal sector alone contributed only 5% to Indonesia's GDP in 2019, according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiatives.To boost its economy, Indonesia wants to move away from exporting raw materials, to focus instead on developing its downstream industries.Downstream activities involve processing raw materials into finished products to provide added value. For instance, crude oil can be refined into petroleum, diesel and plastics.President Jokowi Widodo has said: ""Indonesia always exports raw materials, while it is better to process and consume them through downstream industry or domestically.""As part of that plan, Indonesia banned the export of nickel ore in January 2020, and the government has pledged to the gradually stop exporting other raw materials too.""I think we can reap many benefits of stopping nickel ore export,"" Widodo said in late 2021. ""Therefore, next year, we will stop raw materials export for bauxite ore, and next, gold and tin ores.""The move downstream is expected to create jobs, increase profit margins for the sector, as well as cut down on carbon emissions. ""The impact is supposed to be positive, since value-added products potentially reduce coal mining companies' financial performance at the risk of coal price volatility,"" according to William Simadiputra, analyst at DBS Group Research.Going downstream also reduces exposure to fluctuating commodity prices and the reliance on imports.Widodo has said Indonesians will eventually stand to benefit.""Subsequently, it will create jobs ... it will generate tax income for the country, and new business opportunities, for instance, domestic companies that will export nickel ore,"" the president said. Indonesia has set its sights on three key sectors for downstreaming: the mining and mineral industry, the coal and fuel industry, and the agroindustry.According to Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board, BKPM, the country has the largest nickel reserve in the world and possesses 21 million tons of nickel.Indonesia hopes to transform raw nickel into higher end products like lithium batteries for electric cars — a move the investment board said will eventually bring economic growth.""The Government is working on research regarding lithium-ion battery innovations and it is expected that within two to three years ahead we can produce lithium battery,"" Widodo said in late 2020. Indonesia is the world's fourth-largest coal producer, and the top thermal coal exporter globally.The Southeast Asian nation is also making a push for downstream coal projects, according to Simadiputra, who said coal mining companies receive royalties from the government when such projects succeed.Coal mining is vital for Indonesia, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Shirley Zhang.""Not only does it help ease the current global energy crisis, the country — a key exporter of thermal coal — also benefits from the high seaborne coal prices,"" she told CNBC.""It also ensures energy security for the country's domestic economic growth.""Indonesia's coal production reached 564 million tonnes in 2020, according to the IEA. The country exported 405 million tonnes of coal in the same period — or 31.2 % of world's coal exports that year.Thermal coal is a key driver of Indonesia's economy, Zhang said, adding that manufacturing, the country's biggest GDP contributor at 26%, is also driven by coal power. Indonesia — the fourth largest LPG importer in Asia — plans to ""reduce dependence on costly LPG imports which took up Rupiah 50.6 trillion ($3.6 billion) in subsidies,"" according to S&P Global.For instance, Bukit Asam, an Indonesian state-owned coal miner, has initiated a $2.3 billion coal gasification project with state energy firm Pertamina and U.S. industrial gas and chemicals firm, Air Products.The project is expected to absorb 6 million tonnes of coal and produce 1.4 million tonnes of dimethyl-ether (DME), a form of renewable fuel that can be used to replace diesel and propane. This will help reduce annual LPG imports by 1 million tonnes, according to Simadiputra.""Downstream activities will help to detach Indonesia from energy imports such as LPG. We expect lower energy imports to positively impact Indonesia's trade balance, especially amid the current trend of high energy prices,"" the analyst said.The Southeast Asian country also stands to benefit from the overall trend of clean and renewable energy too, said Zhang from Wood Mackenzie.In fact, Indonesia has the potential to become a leader in decarbonization too, she added.For example, Indonesia could establish itself as a regional authority in decarbonization by demonstrating large-scale carbon capture utilization and storage, or CCUS — a technology that captures carbon dioxide from industrial users of fossil fuels and compresses it so that it can be transported or stored for other uses.""Indonesia is also a key resource base for electric vehicle raw materials such as nickel,"" said Zhang. ""Its production outlook will drive the pace and scale of decarbonizing the transportation sector internationally."" Still, some challenges remain and will have to be addressed before value-added downstream efforts can be ramped up, analysts said.For instance, dimethyl-ether is considered a new type of biofuel with a small market, which makes it expensive compared to fossil fuels.""Support from the central government on replacing existing LPG with DME is crucial, and it needs strong coordination between multi-stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition ahead,"" according to Simadiputra.Bukit Asam's partnership with Pertamina and Air Products ""is a good start in our view,"" he said, pointing out that Pertamina is Indonesia's largest LPG distributor.Indonesia's government plans to attract DME development through some incentives, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Arifin Tasrif said, according to S&P Global.Zhang said that government funding and policies are needed to ensure Indonesia's resource sector is ready for a carbon-free future. For instance, the government could provide funding for upskilling and retraining in decarbonization technologies, she added. But that's assuming the world is still on track to meet its decarbonization targets of at least 43% reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2030, said Zhang, who pointed out that energy security concerns have surged as a result of the war in Ukraine which may derail plans to retire coal for good.This is particularly true for developing nations, as coal continues to be a cheap source of energy for them, she noted."
2022-04-14,"In a biannual Joint Economic Forecast, published Wednesday, Germany's biggest economic institutions reduced their GDP forecasts as the war in Ukraine slows the recovery from Covid-19.The RWI in Essen, the DIW in Berlin, the Ifo Institute in Munich, the IfW in Kiel and the IWH in Halle now expect German GDP to grow by 2.7% in 2022 and 3.1% in 2023.""If gas supplies were to be cut off, the German economy would undergo a sharp recession,"" said Stefan Kooths, research director for business cycles and growth at the Kiel Institute. German economists are forecasting a recession in Europe's largest economy if Russian gas supplies were to stop, and the effects could spread through the continent.In their biannual Joint Economic Forecast, published Wednesday, Germany's five biggest economic institutions sharply reduced their gross domestic product forecasts as the war in Ukraine slows the recovery from Covid-19.The RWI in Essen, the DIW in Berlin, the Ifo Institute in Munich, the IfW in Kiel and the IWH in Halle now expect German GDP to grow by 2.7% in 2022 and 3.1% in 2023, assuming that there is no further economic escalation related to the war in Ukraine and gas flows to Europe from Russia continue. The institutes had previously projected growth of 4.8% in 2022.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the European Parliament have called for the European Union to impose a total embargo on Russian oil, gas and coal imports in light of atrocities against civilians by Russian forces in Ukraine.The EU plans to ban Russian coal imports and is working on sanctions against Russian oil as it looks to ostracize the Kremlin from the global economy, while Russian President Vladimir Putin has also on numerous occasions threatened to cut off the gas supply to Europe.However, such a move is expected to have dire economic consequences for both sides. Germany bought 58.9% of its natural gas from Russia in 2020, according to the European statistics agency.The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the $11 billion project designed to double the flow of gas between Russia and Germany, is now unused and abandoned. Germany halted certification of the pipeline altogether after Russia officially recognized two pro-Russian regions in eastern Ukraine, setting a pretext for the invasion that would ensue. In the event of a total stoppage of the Russian energy supply, the German institutes predicted a cumulative loss this year and next of roughly 220 billion euros ($238 billion), equivalent to over 6.5% of annual economic output. This would result in growth of just 1.9% this year and a contraction of 2.2% in 2023. ""If gas supplies were to be cut off, the German economy would undergo a sharp recession. In terms of economic policy, it would then be important to support marketable production structures without halting structural change,"" said Stefan Kooths, vice president and research director for business cycles and growth at the Kiel Institute.""This change will accelerate for gas-intensive industries even without a boycott, as dependence on Russian supplies, which have been available at favorable prices up to now, is to be overcome quickly anyway.""Kooths advised governments to avoid providing ""poorly targeted transfers"" in order to cushion higher energy prices.""If such support schemes are handed out on a wide front, it will further drive up inflation and undermine the important signaling effect of higher energy prices. This in turn exacerbates the problems of low-income households and increases overall economic costs,"" he said.The European Central Bank faces the uniquely conflicting challenge of reining in record-high inflation without stomping out already weakening economic growth, which is likely to be hit further by supply shocks as the war in Ukraine persists.Euro zone inflation came in at 7.5% for March on an annual basis, according to Eurostat, and the German institutes forecast a full-year average in 2022 of 6.1%, the highest print in 40 years. In the event of an energy supply cut-off, they forecast an increase to a post-war record high of 7.3%. Next year's projected rate of 2.8% will also remain well above the average since reunification, and would rise to 5% in the event of an energy blockade, the report said.""The shockwaves from the war in Ukraine are weighing on economic activity on both the supply side and the demand side,"" Kooths said.""Government stimulus packages during the pandemic already had an inflationary effect. Increasing prices of critical energy commodities following the Russian invasion further fuel the upward pressure on prices."" Geraldine Sundstrom, portfolio manager at PIMCO, told CNBC on Friday that the risk of recession in Europe is far greater than that in the U.S. at this stage.""The European economy is not in the same strong position as the U.S. one and potential industrial recession could be on the doorstep of Europe, depending on the disruption from the conflict, from what is happening certainly in Asia, and we have seen – especially in the automotive sector – a number of factories having to shut down, because of lack of parts and this has reintroduced furlough of some workers in Germany,"" Sundstrom said.""Europe is also facing a very important supply shock and inflationary shock, and if anything, the ECB seems to be more willing to normalize policy despite the fact that the risk of a recession in Europe is way bigger than in the U.S."""
2022-04-15,"China's latest Covid lockdowns are a greater risk for global inflation today than they were in 2020, Bernstein analysts said.The world has become more reliant on Chinese goods since the pandemic started in 2020, which means the latest round of lockdowns have a greater impact on global growth and inflation, they said.Over the last several weeks, mainland China has tackled its worst Covid wave in two years with lockdowns and travel restrictions that foreign business leaders have described as tougher than in early 2020. BEIJING — China's latest Covid lockdowns are a greater risk for global inflation today than they were in 2020, Bernstein analysts said.That's because the world has become more reliant on Chinese goods since the pandemic began, the analysts said in an April 8 note.China's share of exports globally rose to 15.4% in 2021, the highest since at least 2012.China's exports have surged in the last two years as the country was able to control the initial Covid outbreak within weeks and resume production, while the rest of the world struggled to contain the virus. China has maintained its zero-Covid policy, while other countries have relaxed controls in the last year.Over the last several weeks, mainland China has tackled its worst Covid wave in two years with lockdowns and travel restrictions that foreign business leaders have described as tougher than in early 2020. The stay-home orders and virus testing requirements have particularly affected coastal economic centers like Shanghai.""We believe, the macro impact of China lockdowns could be quite high and something which the market is not yet pricing in,"" Bernstein's Jay Huang and a team said in a report. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, Shanghai export container costs are five times higher and air freight rates are two times higher, the report said, noting similar strains on supplier delivery time. ""Hence, there would be higher export of inflation, especially to China's large trading partners but at the same time delay China's own demand recovery.""Reflecting supply chain disruptions, Chinese electric car company Nio announced production halts over the weekend, with some production resuming Thursday. German automaker Volkswagen said its factories on the outskirts of Shanghai and in the northern province of Jilin remained closed through at least Thursday. Bernstein's analysis found that China manufactures the majority of overseas demand for containers, ships, rare earths and solar modules — along with the bulk of mobile phones and PCs.Chinese factories no longer only complete the final assembly for those electronic products but also manufacture components like LCD panels and integrated circuits, the report said, pointing to faster growth in 2021 in exports of those parts.China's first quarter trade data showed steady growth in exports. The country's producer price index and consumer price index rose faster-than-expected in March, according to data out Monday. Since the pandemic began, China has become a significant manufacturer in the auto industry, especially in the electric vehicle supply chain, the Bernstein report said.The analysts noted how automobile and component exports grew an average 119% in 2021 from the previous year, exceeding the 30% growth in China's exports overall. The country accounts for roughly 74% of global battery cell production, the report said.China is the world's largest auto market and began to promote electric vehicle development and purchases in the last several years, primarily through subsidies. Foreign automakers attracted to the market have accordingly begun to launch electric vehicles for China in the last few years. Now, Tesla, BMW and other automakers are increasingly making electric vehicles in China to export to other countries, the Bernstein report said. Including fuel-powered cars, Chinese state-owned automakers SAIC and Chery are the top exporters from China of passenger vehicles by volume, the report said, noting growing sales of China-made cars to Chile, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.While the report did not discuss the specific impact of Covid lockdowns on auto-related supply chains, the analysts pointed out a number of Korean and Japanese automakers faced production disruptions in 2020 when Covid forced Wuhan to lockdown.

2022-04-15,"The first two stimulus checks have come and gone, but the third Economic Impact Payment worth up to $1,400 per person is still up for grabs if you haven't received it yet.Most of the payments authorized by the American Rescue Plan in March 2021 have already been delivered to eligible recipients via direct deposit or mailed checks, as of January 2022.But if you haven't received yours, or qualified for additional money, your last chance to get these funds is through a 2021 tax return, which is due April 18 for most people.Technically, the third stimulus check was an advance on the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit credit, even though it was based on the income and the number of dependents listed in your 2020 or 2019 tax return. That means you could be owed more money if your income dropped or you added new dependents in 2021. Likewise, you could be entitled to the full credit if you never filed a tax return in 2019 or 2020. The third round of stimulus payments is worth up to $1,400 per person if your adjusted gross income is $75,000 or less as a single filer, or $160,000 or less as a joint filer. Families are entitled to $1,400 per dependent for dependents of any age. Before claiming the funds, make sure they weren't sent to you already. You can confirm the amount of the third payment and whether it was sent to you by logging into your IRS online account or the Get My Payment app. You can also refer to a letter sent to you by the IRS, known as Notice 1444-C, which will tell you how much is owed to you. If you lost your stimulus check or suspect it was stolen, you can request the IRS to trace your payment and get the amount automatically reimbursed to you as a tax refund. If you're filing your 2021 tax return before your trace is complete, do not include the payment amount on the Recovery Rebate Credit Worksheet, the IRS says.Otherwise, you'll need to complete the Recovery Rebate Tax Credit worksheet and submit it as part of your 2021 tax return. The worksheet will help you calculate how much you can claim. Then, claim it on line 30 in Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR of your 2021 tax return. Tax software will also guide you through this process and automatically add all the information to your tax return. If you realize later that you made a mistake calculating the Recovery Rebate Credit, don't bother filing an amended return. The IRS will automatically change it for you. They should notify you of any changes in a letter, with a way to dispute the change if you think it was done incorrectly. And remember, you can file your tax return for free if your income is $73,000 or less, using the IRS Free File Program.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Here's an item-by-item look at how much more expensive your groceries are, due to inflation"

BEIJING — China's first-quarter GDP grew faster than expected despite the impact of Covid lockdowns in parts of the country in March, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics Monday.First-quarter GDP rose by 4.8%, topping expectations of a 4.4% increase from a year ago.Fixed asset investment for the first quarter rose by 9.3% from a year ago, topping expectations for 8.5% growth. Investment in manufacturing rose by 15.6% in the first quarter from a year ago, and infrastructure saw an 8.5% increase over the same period.Industrial production in March rose by 5%, beating the forecast for 4.5% growth.However, retail sales in March fell by a more-than-expected 3.5% from a year earlier. Analysts polled by Reuters anticipated a 1.6% decline.Beginning in March, the country has struggled to contain its worst Covid outbreak since the initial phase of the pandemic in 2020. Back then, lockdowns across more than half the country resulted in a 6.8% contraction in first quarter growth from a year earlier.""We must be aware that with the domestic and international environment becoming increasingly complicated and uncertain, the economic development is facing significant difficulties and challenges,"" the bureau said in a statement. The unemployment rate across 31 major Chinese cities rose from 5.4% in February to 6% in March — the highest on record according to official data going back to 2018.""This indicates the unemployment problem in the large cities has become more severe than when the Covid Pandemic started in 2020,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.""The Covid outbreaks only forced Shanghai and some other cities to enter lockdowns in late March and early April. Therefore the economic slowdown likely worsened in April,"" he said. As Covid stretches into a third year, China again faces the challenge of ensuring a record high number of graduates find jobs. This year, the number of higher education graduates are expected to rise by 1.67 million from 2021 to 10.76 million.In March, the unemployment rate for those from 16 to 24 years old remained far higher at 16% — the highest since August 2020.Overall, the national urban unemployment rate ticked higher in March to 5.8%, up from 5.5% in February.That rise ""reflects greater difficulties for businesses' production and operations, and greater pressure on employment,"" Fu Linghui, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a briefing Monday in Chinese, according to a CNBC translation.He noted that since March, some people have had a harder time finding jobs due to the impact of Covid domestically. That contrasts with a historical seasonal trend in which the unemployment rate tended to fall in March, after rising in January and February as workers changed jobs around the Spring Festival, Fu said. ""To achieve this year's 5.5% economic growth target, consumption must not be dragged down by the pandemic, real estate investment must stop falling and stabilize as soon as possible, fiscal spending must be strong enough and imports and exports cannot contribute negatively,"" Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said in Chinese, translated by CNBC.Since retail sales and trade have a limited ability to contribute to growth, the market has greater expectations for real estate to play a role, he said. Real estate, which has struggled since Beijing's crackdown on developers' high use of debt, saw investment rise by 0.7% in the first quarter from a year ago. That's despite double-digit declines in the floor space and total sales of commercial buildings sold.Although economic figures released for January and February beat expectations, figures for March have begun to reflect the impact of stay-home orders and travel restrictions around economic centers like the coastal metropolis of Shanghai.Exports, a major driver of China's growth, rose by a more-than-expected 14.7% in March, but imports unexpectedly fell, down by 0.1% from a year ago, according to data released last week.

2022-04-18,"The largest single factor in the reduced growth forecast was a projected economic contraction of 4.1% across Europe and Central Asia.Other factors behind the slowdown in growth from January's forecast include higher food and fuel costs being borne by consumers in developed economies.Supply disruptions to Ukrainian agricultural exports are also cited as contributing factors to driving prices higher. WASHINGTON -- The World Bank lowered its annual global growth forecast for 2022 on Monday by nearly a full percentage point, down from 4.1% to 3.2%, citing the impact that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is having on the world economy.World Bank President David Malpass told reporters on a conference call that the largest single factor in the reduced growth forecast was a projected economic contraction of 4.1% across Europe and Central Asia, according to Reuters.Other factors behind the slowdown in growth from January's forecast include higher food and fuel costs being borne by consumers in developed economies across the world, said Malpass.These are partly the result of Western sanctions on Russian energy, which have driven up the price of oil and gas worldwide. Supply disruptions to Ukrainian agricultural exports are also cited as contributing factors to pushing prices higher.Russia has blockaded Ukraine's major Black Sea ports, making it extremely dangerous for shipping vessels carrying grain and other products to travel the key maritime pathway connecting Ukraine to the rest of the world.The World Bank is ""preparing for a continued crisis response, given the multiple crises,"" Malpass told reporters. ""Over the next few weeks, I expect to discuss with our board, a new 15-month crisis response envelope of around $170 billion to cover April 2022 through June 2023.""This Ukraine crisis financing package is even larger than the one the World Bank organized for Covid-19 relief, which topped out at $160 billion.Still, the damage that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused to the global economy pales in comparison to the catastrophic effect it has had on the economy of Ukraine, and to a lesser extent that of Russia.Earlier this month, the World Bank projected that Ukraine's annual GDP would fall by 45.1%, an astonishing figure for a country of more than 40 million people.Before the war, analysts had predicted that Ukraine's GDP would rise sharply in the coming years.Russia's economy is also taking a major hit, largely due to the impact of NATO- and Western-backed sanctions and trade embargoes.

2022-04-19,"Chinese real estate developer bond prices have ticked higher as investor confidence gets a boost from policy support for the battered industry.Since March, due to weakening market demand, banks in more than 100 cities in China have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points, Zou Lan, director of the People's Bank of China's financial markets department, told reporters Thursday.But analysts point out Beijing's emphasis that ""houses are for living in, not speculation"" means the property market won't resume the high growth of the past. The tide may be turning on China's battered real estate market.Investor confidence in the sector appears to be improving, as bond trading volumes and prices rose in recent weeks, in part boosted by the government's promise to support the sector and some loosening of policies.related investing newsSlowdown, recession or boom?

""We anticipate fewer developers will be able to employ the highly leveraged, fast-churn strategy that brought past success.""Recent reports show that some cities and banks are willing to support real estate again after a plunge in home sales in the last few months.Since March, due to weakening market demand, banks in more than 100 cities in China have lowered mortgage rates by an average of 20 to 60 basis points, Zou Lan, director of the People's Bank of China's financial markets department, told reporters Thursday.He also noted how Covid had affected some people's income and their ability to pay mortgages on time. ""The government's stance [is] trying to prevent the contagion, preventing the spillover from the real estate sector spillover to the real economy,"" Gary Ng, Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis, told CNBC in a phone interview earlier this month.Any change in China's real estate industry has significant implications for the economy since property and related sectors account for roughly a quarter of GDP, according to Moody's. The latest wave of Covid restrictions has added pressure to growth that was already slowing.""The measures may have been too tight. Now we see this fine tuning of the policy,"" Ng said. ""The worst time is over basically for those developers who are broadly in line with the current regulatory target or framework."" The problems of real estate developers in China came to a head after the authorities rolled out the so-called ""three red lines"" policy in August 2020, aimed at reining in developers after years of growth fueled by excessive debt. The policy places a limit on debt in relation to a firm's cash flows, assets and capital levels.While many developers reduced their debt levels accordingly, a result of the policy was that banks became less willing to lend to the sector.Against this backdrop, Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, fell into default for the first time late last year. As the debt crisis unraveled, other Chinese developers also started showing signs of strain – some missed interest payments, while others defaulted on their debt altogether. The bond issuance in Asia's high yield bond market, dominated by Chinese real estate developers, slumped in the first quarter of this year. The region issued only $4.4 billion worth of debt, about 85% lower than a year ago, according to data from Dealogic.""This was a result of Chinese property developers largely being cut off from the bond market amid a growing number of stressed and distressed situations in the sector,"" said Dealogic.However, sentiment turned around slightly in mid-March after China signaled support for its companies, and indicated that authorities would work toward stability in its struggling real estate sector.Bond trading volumes in the real estate debt market jumped to nearly $700 million in mid-March, a nearly 20% increase from over $583 million traded in the beginning of the month, according to data from electronic fixed income trading platform MarketAxess.By late March, volumes increased further to cross $700 million, before falling back slightly again in April. Bond prices also rose correspondingly. The Ice Bofa Asian dollar high-yield corporate index has climbed more than 15% in the period between mid-March to the beginning of April.Three provinces have also loosened their policies, which include removing restrictions on home purchases for those without full local residency status — and that should lift short-term sentiment, said Nomura in a report on April 4.""These policy relaxation measures are in line with our expectation and confirm the local governments' increasing awareness and efforts to counter the rapid deterioration in the physical property market,"" Nomura said, citing government data that sales across 30 major cities were down 47% year-on-year in March.Natixis' Ng said more large developers, especially state-owned ones, can buy land or acquire other real estate assets at cheaper prices now. He noted the firm's analysis found that seven out of 10 land acquisitions year-to date were by state-owned enterprises, in a sign that the private sector was still struggling.Earlier this month, developer Kaisa announced it entered a strategic cooperation with China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings and China Great Wall Asset Management, both of which are state-owned. The agreement is set to include joint ventures and asset acquisitions, a Hong Kong exchange filing showed. Despite the optimism, the situation ahead for developers could deteriorate further, according to analysts.S&P pointed out that so far the policy relaxation has applied to the demand side, and not for supply of units.""Supply may be limited even if homebuyer sentiment improves because funds are prioritized to complete presold homes and repay debt,"" it said in a briefing last week. ""Defaults will rise as [the] down cycle persists under the shadow of sluggish sales, [continued] narrower funding channels due to lack of confidence.""The ratings agency said it believed that 20 developers are now facing a liquidity crunch – and another 4% could be at risk under the joint venture model.Earlier this year, several developers announced they would not be able to release financial results on time. Despite news of more support for real estate, Ng said Beijing's tone remains focused on preventing speculation in the once-hot market, which means home prices aren't going to increase that much.As a result, companies that once profited from surging home prices are going to need to adapt, he said. ""We will see developers not [be] able to repay their debt.""The fundamental takeaway from recent developments is that China's policy toward property investment has changed, the analysts said.

2022-04-19,"Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic expressed concern about the impact that rate hikes could have on the U.S. economic recovery.Bostic said the fed funds rate could be as low as 1.75%. Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic on Tuesday expressed concern about the impact that rate hikes could have on the U.S. economic recovery, saying the central bank shouldn't move so fast that it chokes off growth.Bostic did not commit in a CNBC interview to what pace the Fed should take in increasing benchmark rates. Instead, he said policymakers should be measured in their approach and watch how what they do impacts conditions.""I think I'm in the same areas as my colleagues philosophically,"" he told CNBC's Sara Eisen in a ""Closing Bell"" interview. ""I think it's really important that we get to neutral and do that in an expeditious way.""""Neutral"" is considered the rate at which the economy is running on its own with rates that are neither boosting nor restricting growth. Bostic said that neutral rate could be between 2% and 2.5% and the funds rate could be as low as 1.75% by the end of 2022. That puts him near the median of the Fed's ""dot plot"" of individual members' projections released each quarter.""I really have us looking at one and three-quarters by the end of the year, but it could be slower depending on how the economy evolves and we do see greater weakening than I'm seeing in my baseline model,"" he said. ""This is one reason why I'm reluctant to really declare that we want to go a long way beyond our neutral place, because that may be more hikes than are warranted given sort of the economic environment.""That puts him in contrast with some of the other Federal Open Market Committee members.On Monday, St. Louis President James Bullard said he sees the fed funds rate, which serves as a benchmark for many consumer debt instruments, rising to 3.5%. He said the Fed needs to go beyond neutral if it has hopes of taming inflation running at its fastest pace in more than 40 years.But Bostic said the Fed ""needs to be cautious as we move forward."" Inflation could be topping, he said, though he noted that real incomes adjusted for the cost of living have been falling.""We do need to get away from zero, I think zero is lower than we should be right now,"" he said. ""But at the same time, we need to just pay attention.""Market pricing is for rate hikes that would bring the funds rate to 2.5% and the Fed ultimately hiking to around 3.2% before cutting rates in late 2024.The Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth in the first quarter of just 1.3%, though Bostic said he expects the annual pace in 2022 to be around 3%.""My goal is to have there not be a recession while I sit in this chair, and I'm just going to do all I can to make that be true,"" he said.Correction: Bostic said the neutral rate of interest is between 2-2.5% and the fed funds rate could be as low as 1.75%. An earlier version misstated his position on the neutral rate."

This represents a 0.8 and 0.2 percentage point drop, respectively, from its forecasts published in January.""Global economic prospects have been severely set back, largely because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, economic counsellor at the IMF, said in a blog post Tuesday, marking the release of the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report.Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 with officials like NATO's Jens Stoltenberg noting that Moscow is hoping to gain control of the whole of its neighbor.""The effects of the war will propagate far and wide, adding to price pressures and exacerbating significant policy challenges,"" Gourinchas said in his blogpost.The World Bank also cut its global growth expectations on Monday, now estimating a growth rate for 2022 of 3.2%, down from 4.1%. The United States, Canada, the U.K. and the European Union have imposed several rounds of sanctions targeting Russian banks, oligarchs and energy.The IMF said these penalties will have ""a severe impact on the Russian economy,"" which estimated that the country's GDP will fall by 8.5% this year, and by 2.3% in 2023.However, the fund has forecast an even bleaker assessment for the Ukrainian economy. ""For 2022, the Ukrainian economy is expected to contract by 35%,"" the IMF said in its latest economic assessment, while adding that more precise analysis on the economic hit was ""impossible to obtain.""""Even if the war were to end soon, the loss of life, destruction of physical capital, and flight of citizens will severely impede economic activity for many years to come,"" the organization said. More broadly, Russia's decision to invade Ukraine has intensified supply shocks to the global economy, while also bringing about new challenges.""Russia is a major supplier of oil, gas, and metals, and, together with Ukraine, of wheat and corn. Reduced supplies of these commodities have driven their prices up sharply,"" the fund said Tuesday.This is expected to hurt lower-income households globally and lead to higher inflation for longer than previously anticipated. The IMF estimates the inflation rate will reach 7.7% in the United States this year and 5.3% in the euro zone. ""The risk is rising that inflation expectations drift away from central bank inflation targets, prompting a more aggressive tightening response from policymakers,"" the fund said.The U.S. Federal Reserve expects to hike interest rates six more times in 2022, while the European Central Bank confirmed last week it is ending its asset purchase program in the third quarter.However, this monetary tightening could be accelerated if inflation remains high.The latest IMF economic outlook also points to concerns about the 5 million Ukrainian refugees who have sought support in neighboring countries, such as Poland, Romania and Moldova, and the ensuing economic pressures for these nations from supporting them.Speaking to CNBC Tuesday, Tobias Adrian, director for monetary and capital markets at the IMF, said that the current string of crises hitting the global economy reminded him of the euro sovereign debt crunch which followed the 2008 crash.""Many commentators and policymakers hoped that the 2008 crisis was over but they were just about to enter this new sovereign debt crisis. Today, we had the pandemic, the pandemic caused tremendous stress in the financial markets … It has left the financial system with certain vulnerabilities and so on top of this pandemic, in this phase of pandemic recovery comes the war in Ukraine and that has caused further stresses in some segments,"" he told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore."

2022-04-20,"San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly acknowledged that a series of rate hikes over the coming months could tip the economy into a recession.The central bank official noted she doesn't expect that to happen, and said any period of negative growth likely would be mild. San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly acknowledged Wednesday that a near-certain series of interest rate hikes over the coming months could tip the economy into a shallow recession, though she noted that isn't her expectation.Responding to the worst inflation the U.S. has seen in more than 40 years, the central bank official said she foresees ""an expeditious march"" through the year toward benchmark interest rates that would neither stimulate nor repress growth — the ""neutral"" rate, in Fed parlance.related investing newsMarkets next week may keep thinking about what could go rightScott Schnipper17 hours ago""Accounting for the risks of being too fast or too slow, I see an expeditious march to neutral by the end of the year as a prudent path,"" she said.The moves, Daly said, would help slow down an overheated economy that now has consumer price inflation running at an 8.5% annual pace. She cited research from Princeton economist and former Fed vice chair Alan Blinder, who asserted that in 11 previous Fed hiking cycles, seven ""were followed by a mild recession or none at all — basically a smooth landing,"" she said in remarks at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. ""Now, since I'm in Las Vegas, I will offer that I think those are pretty good odds.""Asked later whether she considered a mild recession to be the equivalent of a soft landing or acceptable outcome, Daly said her outlook is for the economy to slow to ""something that looks like below-trend growth, but not tip into negative territory, but could potentially tick into negative territory.""That likely would mean a shallow recession, unlike those associated with, for instance, the financial crisis of 2008 or the stagflation days of the late 1970s and early '80s, when then-Chairman Paul Volcker jacked up rates so much that the economy fell into a double-dip recession. Some Wall Street economists see recession risks rising. Deutsche Bank recently said it sees a near-certainty of negative growth, while Goldman Sachs indicated about a 35% chance over the next two years.""Recession is one word, but it describes a whole range of outcomes,"" Daly said in response to a CNBC question. ""It can be a couple of quarters of a tiny bit below zero. That's a very different beast than something like the financial crisis or the Volcker disinflation period.""""That's not something that I'm forecasting or something I think would derail the long-run expansion,"" she added.Markets currently expect the Fed to enact a series of aggressive interest rate hikes between now and the end of the year. Following a 25 basis point, or quarter percentage point, increase in March, the expectation is a series of 50 basis point moves then a slowdown that will take the benchmark fed funds rate to about 2.5% by the end of the year, according to CME Group data.Earlier in the day, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said ""I'm open to doing 50 basis point increases in order to front-load this a little bit."" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Monday said he'd like to move even faster and thinks a 75 basis point move next month would be appropriate, though traders are pricing in no chance of that happening.For her part, Daly said she doesn't want the Fed to slam on the brakes too quickly as that could endanger the pandemic-era recovery, which has been strong outside of the historic inflation move.""If we ease on the brakes by methodically removing accommodation and regularly assessing how much more is needed, we have a good chance of transitioning smoothly and gliding the economy to its long-run sustainable path,"" she said."

The U.S. Treasury Department announced Wednesday that it expanded its wide raft of sanctions to include businesses and individuals that are seen to be helping Russia evade the impact of economic penalties imposed on Moscow.Treasury officials said the department is now targeting Russian commercial bank Transkapitalbank, as well as a network of more than 40 people including oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev it believes aided the Kremlin skirt a wave of economic punishments.The Biden administration also said it's cracking down on companies operating in Russia's virtual currency mining industry, including Bitriver, that help the country monetize its exports and other natural resources.""Treasury can and will target those who evade, attempt to evade, or aid the evasion of U.S. sanctions against Russia, as they are helping support Putin's brutal war of choice,"" said Brian Nelson, the department's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.""The United States will work to ensure that the sanctions we have imposed, in close coordination with our international partners, degrade the Kremlin's ability to project power and fund its invasion,"" he added.The latest sanctions represent new areas into which Washington is expanding its financial war against Russia.The bank cited in the new sanctions, Transkapitalbank, has allegedly been marketing its own proprietary-payment system to banks in Asia and the Middle East as a Russia-friendly alternative to SWIFT, the international payment system from which Russia was banned at the start of the war.Earlier this year, the U.S., European Union, Canada and U.K. cut a handful of Russian banks off the SWIFT financial network, one of Washington's most powerful moves to date to isolate Russia from the global marketplace and cripple its economy.That move effectively prevented Russia from communicating securely with banks beyond its borders.Treasury also said that it is stepping up its efforts to quash a global ""sanctions evasion and malign influence"" network led by Malofeyev, the Russian oligarch. Individually, Konstantin Malofeyev has been subjected to U.S. and European sanctions for nearly a decade for his alleged bankrolling of violent armed separatists in eastern Ukraine.But on Wednesday, Treasury called out and sanctioned not only his business network, but an additional layer of nonprofits he funds, which it accused of disseminating extreme anti-Western and anti-Ukrainian propaganda.One of them, the ""Analytics Center of Katekhon,"" presents itself as a think tank but is in fact ""a proliferator of anti-Western and pro-Kremlin disinformation and propaganda that clearly targets fringe audiences in the West,"" according to the Treasury Department.Also sanctioned was a Malofeyev-linked firm that purports to offer African governments financial consulting. In reality, the International Agency of Sovereign Development (IASD) works with the government of Russia to find business opportunities for sanctioned Russian companies and to enrich Malofeyev himself, Treasury alleged.""In recent years,"" Treasury said Wednesday, ""Malofeyev, covertly or through intermediaries, supported pro-Russian activities that undermine democracy, interfere in elections, and degrade security and stability in a host of countries.""The announcement also represents the Biden administration's first-ever attempt to jab Russia's virtual currency mining industry.Among the companies targeted by U.S. sanctions is Bitriver, a company founded in 2017 that operates its mining facilities with hydroelectric power.The Office of Foreign Assets Control named 10 Russia-based subsidiaries of Bitriver in its latest wave of sanctions.""Russia has a comparative advantage in crypto mining due to energy resources and a cold climate,"" Treasury officials said Wednesday. ""However, mining companies rely on imported computer equipment and fiat payments, which makes them vulnerable to sanctions.""""The United States is committed to ensuring that no asset, no matter how complex, becomes a mechanism for the Putin regime to offset the impact of sanctions,"" they added.Virtual currencies are thought to be a potential avenue through which the Kremlin under Russian President Vladimir Putin could participate in global markets as more Western economies refuse to do business in rubles.— CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this report.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell affirmed the central bank's determination to bring down inflation and said Thursday that aggressive rate hikes are possible as soon as next month.""It is appropriate in my view to be moving a little more quickly"" to raise interest rates, Powell said while part of an International Monetary Fund panel moderated by CNBC's Sara Eisen.

A basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.However, as Powell spoke, market pricing for rate increases got somewhat more aggressive.Expectations for a 50 basis point move in May rose to 97.6%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. Traders also priced in an additional hike equivalent through year's end that would take the fed funds rate, which sets the overnight borrowing level for banks but also is tied to many consumer debt instruments, to 2.75%.Stocks also fell, sending the Dow industrials down more than 400 points and the Nasdaq, with its rate-sensitive tech stocks, lower by more than 2%.

""I don't think you'll hear anyone at the Fed say that that's going to be straightforward or easy. It's going to be very challenging. We're going to do our best to accomplish that."" ""It's absolutely essential to restore price stability,"" he added. ""Economies don't work without price stability.""The Fed had resisted raising rates through 2021 even though inflation was running well above the central bank's 2% longer-run target. Under a policy framework adopted in late 2020, the Fed said it would be content with letting inflation running hotter than normal in the interest of achieving full employment that was inclusive across income, racial and gender demographics.Until several months ago, Powell and Fed officials had insisted that inflation was ""transitory"" and would dissipate as Covid pandemic-related factors such as clogged supply chains and outsized demand for goods over services abated. However, Powell said those expectations ""disappointed"" and the Fed has had to change course.""It may be that the actual [inflation] peak was in March, but we don't know that, so we're not going to count on it,"" he said. ""We're really going to be raising rates and getting expeditiously to levels that are more neutral and then that are actually tight ... if that turns out to be appropriate once we get there.""These will be Powell's last remarks before the May 3-4 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. He is the latest Fed official to say rapid action is needed to take down inflation.Along with the rate hikes, the Fed is expected soon to start reducing the amount of bonds it is holding. The central bank's balance sheet now stands at close to $9 trillion, primarily consisting of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.Discussions at the March meeting indicated the Fed eventually will allow $95 billion of proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off each month.Powell noted that the other than pernicious inflation, the U.S. economy is ""very strong"" otherwise. He characterized the labor market as ""extremely tight, historically so.""Earlier in the day, he referenced former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, who battled inflation in the late 1970s and early '80s with a series of rate hikes that ultimately led to a recession. Volcker ""knew that in order to tame inflation and heal the economy, he had to stay the course,"" Powell said.The Volcker Fed ultimately took the benchmark rate to nearly 20%; it currently sits in a range between 0.25% and 0.50%."

WASHINGTON — The United States will send another $800 million security package and an additional $500 million in direct economic assistance to Ukraine as its military fights off a renewed Russian assault, President Joe Biden said Thursday.""This is money the government can help use to stabilize their economy, to support communities that have been devastated by the Russian onslaught and pay the brave workers that continue to provide essential services to the people of Ukraine,"" Biden said from the Roosevelt Room of the White House.""With this latest disbursement, I've almost exhausted the draw-down authority I have that Congress authorized for Ukraine and a bipartisan spending bill last month,"" Biden said, adding that he would send lawmakers a supplemental budget request next week.Biden said he discussed the new assistance package in person with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal at the White House. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Biden for the additional aid in a tweet. ""This help is needed today more than ever! It saves the lives of our defenders of democracy and freedom and brings us closer to restoring peace in Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy wrote.At the Pentagon, a senior U.S. Defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to share new details, said the new weapons package was tailored to meet an intensified fight in eastern and southern Ukraine.

For nearly eight weeks, Russian forces have faced a slew of battlefield logistics that stalled advances on Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Western intelligence indicated that Russian forces were leaving key positions near Kyiv and relocating to areas in the east of Ukraine.The latest security package, the eighth such installment, includes 72 howitzers, 144,000 artillery rounds, 72 tactical vehicles to tow howitzers, and more than 121 Phoenix Ghost tactical drones.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the Phoenix Ghost drones were ""rapidly developed by the Air Force, in response, specifically to Ukrainian requirements.""The drones are tactical unmanned aerial systems manufactured by Aevex Aerospace in Solana Beach, California. Once the drones are in the region, U.S. troops will have to train Ukrainian forces on how to operate them, Kirby added.""It provides similar capabilities to the Switchblade series of unmanned systems, similar capabilities but not exact,"" Kirby said. ""There are other differences in the scope of capability for the Phoenix Ghosts, but I'm just not going to be able to get into more detail about those capabilities right now.""Biden's remarks follow a Wednesday afternoon meeting with his military commanders and national security officials, who gave him assessments on global threats as well as the ongoing war in Ukraine.Ahead of the meeting, Biden said that U.S. security assistance is flowing into the region daily and that allies are ""stepping up and amplifying the impact of our response.""Last week, following a phone call with Zelenskyy, Biden authorized a separate military assistance package worth $800 million.Since Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the Biden administration has deployed more than 100,000 U.S. troops to NATO-member countries and authorized $3.4 billion in security assistance.

2022-04-22,"Shanghai, China's largest city, has struggled to contain a Covid outbreak and began large-scale lockdowns in late March.In the last week, authorities announced a whitelist of 666 companies that would get priority for resumption of work.Foreign business organizations said the list is a step in the right direction, but it's difficult to get more than half of workers to factories due to lockdown restrictions. BEIJING — Foreign businesses are struggling to bring workers back to factories after weeks of lockdowns in Shanghai, as the country battles its worst Covid outbreak since the pandemic began.Nearly a month since Covid restrictions began in earnest in Shanghai, U.S. and European businesses say that less than half of their employees are able to return to work.Since March, mainland China has imposed travel restrictions and stay-home orders in economic hubs from the southern city of Shenzhen to the northern province of Jilin. The extent of Covid controls has varied by region.Lockdowns in the southeastern metropolis of Shanghai, which began at scale in late March, have been among the most disruptive — to daily life, and to foreign businesses and their supply chains. The city accounts for about 3.8% of China's GDP but is home to the world's busiest port.Last Friday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced it sent a team to Shanghai. The ministry called for prioritizing resumption of work at 666 major businesses in industries such as chips, biopharma and auto and equipment manufacturing. A ""significant"" number of members of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China are on the whitelist, particularly in sectors of manufacturing, chemicals and autos, said Bettina Schoen-Behanzin, the chamber's vice president and Shanghai chair.But ""many companies still face the challenges of labor shortages and logistical difficulties,"" she told CNBC in a statement, estimating that less than 30% of members' workforce are eligible to return to work due to lockdowns.Being on the list means a factory could resume operations if workers live at the production site and contact is limited to people with valid negative virus tests — what's known locally as ""closed-loop management.""""Some estimate that with the re-opening whitelist, the requirements to achieve closed-loop status may not be attainable, or maybe can only recall 30-40% of staff back to manufacturing facilities,"" Matthew Margulies, senior vice president of China operations for the US-China Business Council, said in an email.The difficulty of getting workers into factories means companies cannot easily bring in new staff for other shifts, foreign business organizations said. Before the list was released, some companies in Shanghai and other regions subject to Covid lockdowns were able to maintain minimal operations under the closed-loop protocols.When companies try to bring in new workers, it will usually ""fail with the local communities who don't want to let people out,"" said Johan Annell, partner at Asia Perspective, a consulting firm that works primarily with Northern European companies operating in East and Southeast Asia. Another challenge for workers who do get permission to leave their apartments is Covid-related restrictions on travel, at which point the process of returning to work ""usually fails,"" he said.Transport restrictions can also affect delivery of parts.There's a “fear among truck drivers, if you risk a 14-day quarantine going to that factory maybe you skip that delivery and do something else,” Annell said.For a business to be able to operate at 30% capacity in a week or so is ""a really good outcome,"" he added.""The only good thing about the current situation is it's so obviously unsustainable for the economy and all the companies that it will not last too long,"" he said. ""I would not expect the situation to be nearly as bad as now when we come to the second half of May or June."" Local restrictions vary from province to province, and can range from blanket travel bans to virus test requirements for drivers.The differing measures have taken an uneven toll on businesses, whether foreign or Chinese.A measure of China's road freight transport turnover fell by 27.2% nationwide from April 1 to 17 from a year ago, Nomura's chief China economist Ting Lu pointed out in a report Wednesday. For Shanghai, that same transport measure plunged by 82.6% over the same time period, the report said.China's central government has more than once called on local authorities to support transportation services and remove constraints, such as making drivers wait for virus test results before they could move on.Last week, Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu warned in a WeChat post — akin to a Facebook update — that if work and production in Shanghai cannot resume by May, all the industrial and tech companies with supply chain ties to the region will need to stop production, especially automobiles.

Yu's post came around the same time the government announced the whitelist.Asked about such warnings and staffing issues, the ministry of industry told reporters Tuesday that the problems were only ""temporary,"" and that authorities would improve the whitelist system.""On the one hand, we think the government does understand how important Shanghai is. On the other hand, 600 manufacturing companies — it's a good first step but there are thousands of manufacturing companies in Shanghai that are shut down,"" Michael Hart, Beijing-based president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said in a phone interview Wednesday.""We had some of our companies in northern China contact us, their key suppliers in Shanghai are not among those allowed to restart,"" Hart said. Foreign businesses in China have reported varying states of returning to work. Shanghai still reports new daily Covid cases of around 20,000, with and without symptoms.Tesla's Shanghai factory was ""back up and running"" as of Wednesday, according to CEO Elon Musk's comments during a quarterly earnings call, per a StreetAccount transcript. ""They really had significant challenges due to the Covid shutdowns and nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles."" On the other hand, American chemicals company DuPont told CNBC late Tuesday that while most of its China manufacturing sites were operating normally or under closed-loop management, those in Shanghai remained shut.""Our manufacturing sites in Shanghai will resume production as soon as we receive government approval and when our colleagues are allowed to leave from community health management,"" the company said. ""We are assessing supply chain logistics challenges and are seeking alternative routes and systems to transport products and materials to meet our customers' needs.""As of Monday, Volkswagen said it was evaluating how feasible it was to resume production at its plant in Anting on the outskirts of Shanghai, while its factories in the northern city of Changchun in Jilin province ""have gradually resumed production.""German chemicals giant BASF said Wednesday that its sites in Shanghai have operated under local management restrictions since late March, with some producing at reduced levels.""There have been individual raw material supply issues, logistic disruptions and labor shortages, that are impacting our operation and business,"" the company said, noting that most of its production sites in China remain in operation.Correction: This story has been updated to address an editing error and accurately reflect that U.S. and European businesses say less than half their factory employees have been able to return to work."
2022-04-22,"Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she's in favor of raising interest rates by 50 basis points, perhaps multiple times, but wouldn't favor going higher than that.Mester called the Fed's pivot from the historically high levels of accommodation during the pandemic era ""the great recalibration of monetary policy."" Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Friday she's in favor of raising interest rates quickly to bring down inflation, but not so quickly as to disrupt the economic recovery.That means a strong likelihood of backing a 50 basis point rate hike at the next Fed meeting and perhaps a few more after, but not going to 75 basis points, as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard suggested earlier this week. A basis point is 0.01 percentage points.""My own view is we don't need to go there at this point,"" Mester said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" when asked by host Sara Eisen about the 75-basis-point move. ""I'd rather be more deliberative and more intentional about what we're planning to do.""Mester said she would like to see the Fed get its benchmark overnight borrowing rate to 2.5% by the end of this year, a rate that she and many Fed officials see as being ""neutral,"" or neither stimulating nor repressing growth.The fed funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight borrowing, while also serving as a benchmark for many forms of consumer debt. It currently is set in a range between 0.25%-0.5%, following a quarter-percentage point increase in March.""I would support at this point where the economy is a 50 basis point rise and maybe a few more to get to that 2.5% level by the end of the year,"" Mester said. ""I think that's a better path. ... I kind of favor this methodical approach, rather than a shock of a 75 basis point [increase]. I don't think it's needed for what we're trying to do with our policy.""Her comments mesh with what Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday.Though the statements from both officials also were in line with recent Fed communications, they coincided with a fresh round of selling on Wall Street in both stocks and bonds.Mester called the Fed's policy pivot from the historically high levels of accommodation during the pandemic era ""the great recalibration of monetary policy.""""We are trying to let the markets know where we see the economy going and why monetary policy needs to move off of that real extraordinary level of accommodation that was needed at the start of the pandemic,"" she said.""Of course, our goal is to do that in a way that sustains the expansion and sustains healthy labor markets,"" Mester added.According to the CME Group's FedWatch tracker, market pricing currently indicates the Fed taking the funds rate a bit past where Mester indicated — possibly to 2.75% following anticipated hikes of 50, 75, 50, 25, 25 and 25 basis points respectively at its six remaining meetings through the end of the year."
2022-04-25,"Concerns about stagflation are weighing on Wall Street sentiment Monday morning, noted economist Mohamed El-Erian told CNBC in an interview before the opening bell."
2022-04-25,"As the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury pushes ever closer to 3% — a symbolic level not seen since late 2018 — financial analysts have described how it could affect people's finances in a number of ways.Last week, the 10-year rate hit 2.94%, its highest point in more than three years. That's also a big jump from where the 10-year started the year, at around 1.6%. It's significant because it is considered the benchmark for rates on all sorts of mortgages and loans.Soaring inflation, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war, has led to concerns that this could hurt consumer demand and drag on economic growth. In addition, there are fears that the Federal Reserve's plan to curb rapidly rising prices by aggressively hiking its own funds rate and generally tightening monetary policy could also tip the economy into a recession.As a result, investors have been selling out of bonds, which pushes yields higher as they have an inverse relationship. So what would it mean for your money if that rate hits 3%? One consequence of rising yields is higher borrowing costs on debt, such as consumer loans and mortgages.For instance, Schroders Investment Strategist Whitney Sweeney told CNBC via email that the effect of a higher 10-year yield on college loans will be felt by those students taking federal loans for the upcoming school year.""The rate is set by Congress who approves a margin applied to the May 10-year treasury auction,"" she said, but highlighted that the rate is currently zero for existing federal student loans due to pandemic relief measures.In addition, Sweeney said private variable-rate student loans would be expected to rise as the 10-year Treasury yield climbs.Sweeney said mortgage rates tend to move in line with the 10-year Treasury yield. ""We've already seen a significant uptick on mortgage rates since the start of the year,"" Sweeney added. Meanwhile, ING Senior Rates Strategist Antoine Bouvet told CNBC via email that higher interest rates on government debt would also mean higher returns on savings placed in fixed-income securities.""This also means pensions funds have less difficulties investing to pay future pensions,"" he added.In terms of stock market investments, however, Bouvet said that higher bond interest rates would likely make it a more challenging environment for sectors with companies that tend to hold more debt. This is something that has been associated with technology companies and part of the reason this sector has seen more volatility recently.Similarly, Sweeney pointed out that when yields were closer to zero, investors had little choice but to invest in riskier assets such as stocks to generate returns.But as the 10-year Treasury yield approaches 3%, she told CNBC via email that both cash and bonds were becoming ""more attractive alternatives as you are getting paid more without taking on as much risk.""Sweeney said that shorter-dated bonds, in particular, can look more attractive, given this is where significant interest rate hikes have already been priced in. Wells Fargo Senior Macro Strategist Zach Griffiths told CNBC on a phone call that it was also important to understand what higher yields would mean for companies' future cash flows, when looking at investing in stocks.He said that one way to value stocks was to project forward the level of free-cash flow the company is expected to generate. This is done by using a discount rate, which is a type of interest rate, informed by Treasury yields. Discounting back to the current cash-flow level comes up with an intrinsic value for a company.""When the rate used to discount those future cash flows back to the present is low, then the present value of those cash flows (i.e. intrinsic value of the company) is higher than when rates are high due to the time value of money,"" Griffiths explained via email.  Nevertheless, Griffiths said stocks had broadly managed to withstand the uncertainty presented by higher inflation, geopolitical tensions and a more hawkish tone on policy from the Fed.Griffiths also highlighted that a 3% yield on the 10-year Treasury yield was very much a ""psychological level,"" given it wouldn't represent much of an increase from the current rate. He said Wells Fargo expected that the 10-year yield could finish the year above 3%, and didn't rule out it hitting 3.5% or 3.75%, but stressed that wasn't the firm's ""base case.""Check out: How to protect your savings as inflation soars"

2022-04-26,"President Biden's proposal to limit 1031 exchanges would severely limit the property values investors can use and also adversely impact the overall U.S. economy.If the proposal is approved, savvy wealthy investors would likely just hold on to property in response — expecting that the tax code will change once again.Taxes paid and related to businesses using like-kind exchanges were already projected to produce $7.8 billion for the IRS last year, according to a May 2021 study by Ernst & Young. As part of President Biden's 2023 budget, the administration proposed severe limitations to so-called 1031 exchanges.A 1031 exchange is part of the IRS tax code, allowing real estate investors to defer taxes by exchanging ""like-kind"" properties. The term ""like-kind"" refers to the nature or character of the property. These properties must only be used for business purposes or held as investments.The proposal would allow the deferral of gains up to an aggregate amount of $500,000 for each taxpayer ($1 million in the case of married individuals filing a joint return) each year for real property exchanges that are like-kind. Any gains from like-kind exchanges in excess of $500,000 (or $1 million in the case of married individuals filing a joint return) a year would be recognized by the taxpayer in the year the taxpayer transfers the real property subject to the exchange.

For instance, an apartment building can be exchanged for a warehouse, which could then be exchanged for an investment in a senior living facility. President Biden's proposal would not only severely limit the property values that investors can use in an exchange, but also adversely impact the overall economy. While this proposal is intended to generate $1.95 billion in revenue for the government through taxing the sale of real estate, many people don't realize that taxes paid and related to businesses using like-kind exchanges were already projected to produce $7.8 billion for the IRS last year, according to a May 2021 study by Ernst & Young.Additionally, the proposal's effective date of Dec. 31, 2022, for completed exchanges is problematic. Because an owner has 180 days to identify and exchange a property, anyone considering a like-kind exchange in 2022 would essentially need to initiate the process within the next couple of months to receive the full benefit of the traditional time frame.Some advocates of President Biden's proposal might argue that 1031 exchanges primarily benefit the wealthy, and it wouldn't impact middle-class investors because they're unlikely to exceed the respective $500,000 and $1 million limitations. However, if the proposal is approved by the House of Representatives and Senate, wealthy investors who are savvy would likely just hold on to property in response — expecting that the tax code will change once again in the future and restore a more expansive environment for 1031 exchanges. Their reluctance to sell property in the meantime would slow transaction volume and create an unintended ripple effect within the real estate sector. The Ernst & Young study projected that businesses related to 1031 exchanges would produce 568,000 jobs, create $27.5 billion of labor income and add $55.3 billion to GDP during the course of last year.There are numerous parties involved throughout the 1031 exchange process, including real estate investors, escrow specialists, qualified intermediaries, finance companies for lending, attorneys who negotiate agreements, Delaware Statutory Trust brokers, sponsors who create DSTs and third-party reporting professionals responsible for aspects like appraisals, property conditions, title checks, surveys and due diligence. As a result, if exchanges are limited as President Biden proposes, the negative impact would extend far beyond prospective sellers. Finally, small businesses — which compose 80% of companies in the U.S. — would be adversely affected, as well.For example, if a company owns a smaller property and wants to purchase a larger one (or numerous properties) to allow for continued growth, it wouldn't be able to benefit from the real estate appreciation and tax deferral provided by a like-kind exchange, thus stalling potential business expansion.Attempting to cap 1031 exchange tax deferral isn't new. To that point, President Obama's 2016 budget proposal included limiting the deferral on real property to $1 million annually. Since section 1031 of the tax code hasn't seen a major change since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, it's a natural target for the Biden administration to generate additional revenue for the IRS.However, in this case, the extensive drawbacks of President Biden's proposed limits on 1031 exchanges clearly outweigh any possible benefits.— By Edward Fernandez, president and CEO of 1031 Crowdfunding "
2022-04-26,"In just about a week, several economists at major investment banks have cut their China growth expectations.The new median forecast among nine financial firms tracked by CNBC expects 4.5% China GDP growth for the full year. Nomura had the lowest forecast, while UBS cut its estimates the most. BEIJING — In just about a week, several investment banks have cut their China growth forecasts as Covid lockdowns drag on in the economic hub of Shanghai.The new median forecast among nine financial firms tracked by CNBC predicted 4.5% China GDP growth for the full year. That's well below the official government target for a 5.5% increase.At the low end of predictions was Nomura with a forecast of 3.9%, down from 4.3% previously.""The stringently enforced [zero-Covid strategy] causes a big supply shock to the overall economy, especially to cities under full and partial lockdowns,"" the Japanese investment bank's chief China economist Ting Lu said in a report on Wednesday.""This supply shock may further weaken demand for homes, durable goods and capital goods due to falling income and rising uncertainty,"" he said. Since March, mainland China has battled its worst Covid outbreak since early 2020. Shanghai, home to the world's busiest port, has been one of the hardest-hit regions. A citywide, two-part lockdown that began about a month ago has dragged on with no clear end in sight.A major business district in Beijing, the national capital, began three days of mass testing on Monday and closed non-essential businesses in one area to control a spike in cases over the weekend. Among nine financial firms, UBS cut its China GDP growth target the most, down by 0.8 percentage points to 4.2% based on ""intensified downward pressure on the economy.""Despite expectations for more policy support, economist Wang Tao said in an April 18 report her team does not expect Beijing to do ""whatever it takes"" to achieve the official 5.5% target since it was set before the latest wave of Covid and the Russia-Ukraine war. ""We also do not believe that economic impact of Covid policy alone will change the government's Covid policy shift soon, as minimizing Covid cases and death will likely remain the top priority,"" Wang said.As of Tuesday morning, Shanghai had recorded more than 150 Covid-related deaths. Bank of America's China economist Helen Qiao made the second-largest cut, down by 0.6 percentage points to 4.8%.""Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions imposed in Shanghai and neighboring cities are not only hitting local demand but also causing logistic breakdowns and widespread supply-chain disruptions within and outside of the area,"" the bank said in an April 19 report.""In our view, even if such control measures will ultimately be rolled back and economic activities will gradually normalize by mid-year, a heavy toll on growth already seems inevitable,"" the report said. Allianz Trade's forecast reduction marked the second cut in just a few months.On Wednesday, the firm lowered its GDP forecast to 4.6%, down from 4.9% — which itself was a revision from the 5.2% estimate set around the start of the year.The first downgrade came after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, and the second downgrade assumes the Shanghai lockdown lasts for a month before a return closer to pre-pandemic levels in May, said Françoise Huang, senior economist at Allianz Trade.If the lockdown in Shanghai lasts for two months and other large cities are affected, she expects China's GDP would only grow by 3.8% this year.Last week, the International Monetary Fund also lowered its China GDP forecast for the second time this year. The new estimate is for 4.4% growth, down from a cut in January to 4.8%, versus the IMF's expectations in October for 5.6% growth in 2022. China reported on April 18 that first-quarter GDP grew by a greater-than-expected 4.8%, with industrial production and fixed asset investment also topping forecasts. But retail sales contracted by a more-than-expected 3.5%.Later that day, JPMorgan cut its forecast for full-year GDP to 4.6%, down from 4.9% previously. The bulk of the downgrade came from reduced expectations for consumption growth, with that for exports unchanged and investment trimmed by 0.1 percentage points.""It should not be surprising [the] Omicron drag on economic activity will be larger in April than in March,"" said the bank's emerging markets Asia economic and policy research team. They estimated parts of China accounting for about 25% of national GDP were in full or partial lockdown as of early April.

Economist Robin Xing and his team said China would not likely end its zero-Covid policy until after a scheduled political reshuffle in the fall.""This means that sporadic lockdowns across the nation in the coming two quarters would constrain consumption, even as production would be sheltered by closed loop management systems,"" the report said.

BEIJING — As Covid controls drag down growth, China plans to boost its economy with more infrastructure investment.That's the same approach the government has used in the past, and one that analysts say adds to problems for sustainable growth in the long term.Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for an ""all-out"" effort to construct infrastructure. Proposed projects range from waterways and railways to facilities for cloud computing.Xi was speaking at a meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, a group he heads.""The meeting suggests to us that Chinese policymakers have been increasingly aware of the strong growth headwinds from Covid restrictions and continued property downturn, and thus becoming more determined to ramp up policy easing measures,"" Lisheng Wang and a team at Goldman Sachs said in a note Wednesday.""We believe infrastructure investment should be one key policy lever to stabilize growth,"" the Goldman analysts said, noting expectations for slowing growth in exports, weak private investment and the zero-Covid policy remaining in place for much of the year and hurting consumption and services. Since March, mainland China has faced its worst outbreak of Covid-19 since the initial shock of the pandemic in early 2020.Although first-quarter GDP topped expectations with 4.8% year-on-year growth, several investment banks have cut their full-year growth forecasts as travel restrictions and stay-home orders disrupt supply chains, especially in and around the metropolis of Shanghai, home to the world's busiest port.Economists have pointed out how zero-Covid affects consumer spending far more than factories, which can sometimes maintain limited production under the policy.Retail sales fell by 3.5% from a year ago in March — more than the 1.6% decline forecast by a Reuters poll.Fixed asset investment for the first quarter grew more than expected, with that in infrastructure up by 8.5% from a year ago. ""An even more forceful infrastructure push would help dampen some of the downward pressures on growth that are severely challenging China's ability to meet its 5.5% growth target,"" Louis Kuijs, APAC chief economist at S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.However, ""currently, China's Covid policy is the key bottleneck to growth."" he said. ""It will be really hard to get close to 5.5% growth this year without some easing of the Covid stance.""Xi's call for more infrastructure investment comes as local stocks have plunged on worries about growth in the world's second-largest economy. Among nine financial firms tracked by CNBC, the median GDP forecast is 4.5%, a full percentage point below China's official GDP target of around 5.5% announced in early March. ""The extent of the lockdown and continuing weakness in the property sector are making it increasingly difficult for China to meet the GDP growth target this year, but I expect them to make a major effort in the second and third quarters,"" Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University in Beijing, said in an email.Ahead of the official target's release, Pettis accurately predicted Chinese officials would set a GDP target between 5% and 5.5%.""The problem is that the more the country's growth relies on government-led spending on infrastructure, the more vulnerable it is to a slowdown,"" he said, noting how infrastructure investment feeds into a cycle of higher growth expectations, which in turn requires more investment.Pettis said in a report in March there are limits to the extent infrastructure investment can boost developing countries' growth. He said he believes China passed that point more than a decade ago and what's now needed is much harder institutional change.

This is more than 1 percentage point lower than a previous forecast made before Russia invaded Ukraine. ""The main channel through which the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia affect the euro area economy is rising global energy prices and energy security. Because they are net energy importers, higher global prices represent a negative terms-of-trade shock for most European countries, translating to lower output and higher inflation,"" the IMF said at the time.Europe's dependence on Russian energy is clearly a widespread economic concern.

However, natural gas, which is the commodity that the EU imports the most from Russia, is what investors are sharply focused on.When asked if oil and natural gas sanctions on Russia could pose an economic risk for Europe, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC Tuesday: ""Of Russian oil not so much, of Russian gas that's a different — a much bigger challenge and that is really because large part[s] of industries are dependent on gas as their base commodity to make their product ... so that's what could cause the second order effect, specifically in the European economy."""
2022-04-28,"The following commentary is co-authored by William R. Rhodes, CEO of William R. Rhodes Global Advisors, former chairman and CEO of Citibank, and author of ""Banker to the World: Leadership Lessons from the Front Lines of Global Finance""; and by Stuart Mackintosh, executive director of nonprofit The Group of Thirty.We should all care what happens in China, because it will affect us all.Economic dangers and Chinese President Xi Jinping's responses to them will affect China first and foremost — but trouble in China could spell trouble everywhere this year and next.The world is rightly focused on the atrocities being committed by Russia in Ukraine, and China's choice to stand with Russia is straining globalization's links.But China's economic challenges go beyond the war. Threats to China's outlook are rising in four distinct but overlapping areas: at home, in health, in debt, and in a fracturing globe. Chinese real estate defaults continue. Last year saw a record number of defaults among Chinese developers, from Evergrande on down. S&P estimates that between 20% and 40% of property developers may face default.Property development accounts for 25-30% of China's economy, according to a January report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank. A stumble in real estate bodes ill for the economy as a whole. Economists have demonstrated that most recessions are either equity- or housing bust-related. Once home prices shake, and start falling, we know the effect of debt on declines in home prices: The former amplifies the latter and can cause a collapse in wider consumption. Underwater homeowners stop spending as their house prices fall.China is not at that dangerous juncture yet. But the signs are ominous. We would be naive to think that normal economic boom-bust rules never apply in China, or to assume that Chinese authorities can always effectively control prices across the entire country indefinitely. Yet we have to hope they can manage housing better than the West did in 2007-2008. As China's housing markets shake, the effects of the pandemic policy are making economic matters worse.China's zero-Covid policy, by far the toughest medical and public health response to the pandemic anywhere, is in trouble. China's rigid stance on prevention paid huge dividends — the country continued to operate largely free of the virus in 2020 and 2021. Today however, as the virus mutates and spreads rapidly, those measures may be more costly. An uptick in cases in Shanghai to about 20,000 a day last week caused the city to shut down, triggering citizens' anger and the quarantining of 26 million residents. Shanghai alone contributes 4% of China's gross domestic product and is its largest port.Lockdowns are being imposed in cities across China. The negative economic effects of its hard-to-sustain Covid policy will become visible in the months ahead. Already, economists are cutting growth forecasts for the country.If demand in China weakens, everyone outside the country may feel it too. It's unclear whether the central government is willing or able to pivot from zero tolerance to a new approach — even though such a shift appears increasingly necessary to outsiders. Interest rates are rising as the developed world tries to contain inflation. Many loans made by Chinese entities as part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative are not only straining balance sheets in low-income countries across the globe, but will also burden China's banks with nonperforming loans. That, in turn, will affect the economic performance of those banks, which are key conduits for Chinese domestic investment, businesses and the economy.Belt and Road has saddled developing states with at least $385 billion in debts, according to a 2021 report from AidData, an international development research lab based at the College of William and Mary in Virginia. There, China faces three negative dynamics: debt defaults, nonperforming loans on the books of its largest banks and state lenders, and collateral damage to diplomatic and geopolitical interests if it seizes nations' assets as part of sometimes onerous loan terms.In 2022, China's leadership will learn that not all lending is smart policy. Even if the contract appears beneficial at first glance, China needs solvent borrowers and happy customers and allies, not bilateral sleight of hand, defaults and angry citizens. Globalization — the engine that powers China's economy — risks stalling under the pressure of the pandemic and Russia's war with Ukraine. Supply chains are stretched and broken, or else being reconstituted with new routes and links.China's leaders must ask whether their political support for a declining, weak, and unpredictable Russia is worth more to China than an interlinked world in which all competitors agree to general rules and norms. Everyone benefits from such a global architecture.Choosing Russia over the globalization in which their country is so deeply embedded is a shortsighted, damaging economic bargain, one which could result in secondary sanctions on Chinese firms, as the U.S. has warned. Read morePutin's strength now looks like his main weakness, with people too scared to challenge him Russia may continue the war, diminished, shrunken, fueled by its oil and gas, but ostracized by most countries in the world. China too may pay a heavy price if it continues to back Russia at the expense of engagement with the trading system the country relies on for economic growth.All those tough challenges suggest that the Chinese government's official forecast of a 5.5% growth rate in 2022 is too optimistic. Indeed, it now seems more likely than not that China will grow at below 5% in 2022 — a rate not seen since the crisis of 1989 in Tiananmen Square.Such an economic outcome would be bad news for China, and bad news for the rest of the globe, even as we sometimes distrust one another.Let us hope the right choices are made — choices that are globally framed rather than narrowly constructed."
2022-04-28,"Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, alone imports 80% of its wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Lebanon, already years into a crippling debt and inflation crisis, imports 60% of its wheat from the two warring countries, which provide 80% of Tunisia's grain.     Inflation surged to 14.8% in the MENA region in 2021, according to the International Monetary Fund.  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — For centuries, bread has been the lifeblood of civilization. Riots and revolutions have been sparked over the availability of this basic dietary staple — and over food prices more broadly, particularly when it comes to the Middle East and North Africa. Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine now threatens a huge proportion of the wheat and grain that these countries rely on. Together, Russia and Ukraine account for roughly one-third of the world's global wheat exports, nearly 20% of its corn, and 80% of its sunflower oil — and they provide the majority of the MENA region's supply. Wheat futures are up 30% since the invasion began in late February.Before the war, more than 95% of Ukraine's total grain, wheat and corn exports was shipped out via the Black Sea, and half of those exports went to MENA countries. That vital conduit is now shut, choking off Ukraine's maritime trade after its ports came under attack from Russia's military.  The country is now trying to export some of its produce by rail, which has enormous logistical limits, while Ukrainian farmers whose infrastructure hasn't been destroyed attempt to till their fields wearing bulletproof vests. Russia is the world's number one exporter of wheat, as well as – crucially – the top exporter of fertilizer. Fears of getting caught up in western sanctions on Moscow have already disrupted Russia's exports, too.  All of this is turbocharging the rising inflation that's hitting the population of roughly 500 million people, particularly its poorest and those already facing high unemployment and worsening economic prospects. ""Inflation and economics, more than political freedom, are key"" for the region's stability, Kamal Alam, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told CNBC.Alam pointed to the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, the young Tunisian street vendor whose act of protest set off the Arab Spring protests of 2011.  ""Even the vendor who burned himself in Tunis did so because of economic indignation, not (then-Tunisian president) Ben Ali,"" he said. ""One would argue the first and foremost reason for unrest in the Arab world is always lack of economic mobility.""   Inflation surged to 14.8% in the MENA region in 2021, according to the International Monetary Fund. Already at that point, higher food prices were the main driver — making up about 60% of the increase in the region, excluding the oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council states.  That was before the war in Ukraine began. Now, the U.N. says that food prices as of April are 34% higher than they were one year ago. ""We've got now 45 million people in 38 countries that are knocking on famine's door,"" David Beasley, executive director of the U.N.'s World Food Programme, told CBS in an interview last week. ""And you may see a general price increase of food, let's say 38 to 40%, but in some of the very tough places, it's going to be 100, 200% like in Syria.""  While countries will be looking for alternative sources for their crucial food imports, surging global inflation and potential export restrictions make switching expensive. And water scarcity across the MENA region means local agricultural production is very limited. Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, alone imports 80% of its wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Lebanon, already years into a crippling debt and inflation crisis, imports 60% of its wheat from the two warring countries, which provide 80% of Tunisia's grain.     Egypt ""has a lot to lose from the war as its bread subsidies program reaches over half of the population and forms a pillar of the social contract that maintains stability in the most populous Arab state,"" said Amer Alhussein, economic development expert and advisor for the post-conflict initiative Plant for Peace. This, he says, could explain why Egypt's wealthy Gulf allies have rushed to its aid with billions of dollars in funds for its central bank and other investments to boost its economy. While Egypt's government can keep borrowing money, rising interest rates in major economies and weak appetite for emerging market bonds will weigh heavily on the country ""and may become a sovereign risk factor and lead to a default that would have a catastrophic impact on its population,"" Alhussein added. Lebanon, meanwhile, is facing ""many warnings of an impending famine,"" Alhussein said. ""The current situation could very soon develop into protests and riots like the ones that took place in 2019, but with a much more violent impact given the ever-worsening standard of life and food security in the country."" Further, higher wheat prices alone ""can increase (the Middle East's) external financing needs by up to $10 billion in 2022,"" the IMF wrote in its latest Middle East and Central Asia Regional Economic Outlook released Wednesday. ""Supply shortages originating from Russia and Ukraine can endanger food security, particularly for low-income countries, as they may also suffer from potential aid diversion."" About a quarter of Ukraine's latest pre-invasion wheat harvest is still available on markets, but that will last roughly three months, analysts say. This fall, the WFP's Beasley warns, is when the war's impact will really hit MENA, in a crisis that he believes could trigger mass migration.   ""If you think we've got hell on earth now, you just get ready,"" Beasley warned in an interview with Politico in March. ""If we neglect northern Africa, northern Africa's coming to Europe. If we neglect the Middle East, the Middle East is coming to Europe."" Taufiq Rahim, a Dubai-based senior fellow in the international security program at think tank New America, agreed that the worst may be yet to come. ""At a time of rising inflation, increased commodity prices and supply chain gridlocks, the wider region could be in for an unprecedented economic shock this summer,"" Rahim told CNBC. ""A new political Pandora's box will be opened by the rising economic discontent and we will see governments under increasing pressure."""
2022-04-28,"Gazprom announced that gas supplies to two Eastern European countries would cease after they refused Moscow's demand to pay for gas in rubles.Gas accounts for around a quarter of the European Union's energy generation, and Russia typically supplies around 40% of the bloc's natural gas imports.Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding and Senior Economist Kallum Pickering said a sudden stop to gas supplies to Europe would push Europe into a recession. Europe could be pushed into recession if Russia's gas squeeze widens, economists have suggested, after Gazprom cut off flows to Poland and Bulgaria.The state-owned energy giant on Wednesday announced that gas supplies to the two Eastern European countries had ceased after they refused Moscow's demand to pay for gas in rubles. Gazprom said that supplies would resume once these payments were made, prompting accusations of ""blackmail"" from Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov.With deadlines approaching in the coming weeks for payment from a host of other European countries that are unlikely to acquiesce to the Kremlin's demands for ruble payment, concerns over President Vladimir Putin's previous threats of a broad blockage of gas supplies to ""unfriendly"" nations have returned to the fore.In a research note Wednesday, Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding and Senior Economist Kallum Pickering said the switch-off appeared to be a warning from Moscow that it could make good on this threat.Gas accounts for around a quarter of the European Union's energy generation, and Russia typically supplies around 40% of the bloc's natural gas imports. Europe faces concurrent economic shocks from the war in Ukraine and a surge in food and energy prices exacerbated by the conflict, which has prompted concerns about ""stagflation"" — an environment of low economic growth and high inflation.Berenberg suggested that the current headwinds will likely maintain stagflationary pressures in the second quarter of 2022.""A sudden stop of Russian gas supplies to Europe could push Europe into a recession. The precise impact of such an immediate gas embargo is hard to predict,"" Schmieding and Pickering said.""Calculations that it would lower the level of euro zone GDP in 2023 by 3 percentage points relative to a baseline call ... seem to be slightly too pessimistic, in our view, but it would certainly be a major hit to activity until the end of the next cold season in the spring of 2023.""However, such a move would also be costly for Russia and tricky to implement, and although the decision to stop flows to Poland and Bulgaria may strengthen the EU's resolve to end its dependency on Russian gas, many member states oppose an immediate embargo of imports. While Poland had announced plans to phase out all Russian fuel imports by the end of this year, the EU plans to drastically reduce gas purchases by the end of 2022 while working toward a total phase-out by 2030.As such, Berenberg's base case is that the EU will reduce gas imports as quickly as is feasible without risking a physical shortage, likely resulting in an end to imports in 2024.""In such a case, energy prices would remain high but would likely not rise further. Europe could gradually digest the energy price shock, likely returning to significant growth over the summer unless Chinese COVID-19-related lockdowns and the resulting supply shortages were to get much worse beyond Q2,"" the economists added.However, they noted that the cessation of Russian gas flows remains a tail risk that would probably force some European countries to ration gas supplies to certain areas of industry in late 2022 or early 2023. Euro zone inflation surged to a record-high 7.5% in March as the war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions against Russia drove up energy prices. Russia's move increases the upside risks to the inflation forecast, but Capital Economics Commodities Economist Edward Gardner noted on Thursday that any further rise would likely be small in comparison to those that have already occurred since the Russian invasion.""We are currently forecasting euro-zone inflation of 7% and 3% this year and next. If European natural gas prices rose to €150 per MWh and remained there, rather than falling to €75 by the end of next year as we currently forecast, headline inflation would be 0.2ppts higher than in our forecasts,"" Gardner said.He added that Wednesday's announcement from Gazprom increased the risk of outright gas shortages, which would ""exacerbate the recession"" that Capital Economics is already projecting for the euro zone in 2022.""If Russia cut off gas exports to Germany, the government would probably ration gas consumption. Households would probably be protected, so industry (especially chemical and metallurgy) would be worst hit, causing a deep recession,"" Gardner said."

The Bank of Japan may be limited in its ability to deal with recent weakness in the yen, but experts who spoke with CNBC noted the currency is not really the central bank's main focus anyway.The Japanese yen went above 130 against the dollar on Thursday after the BOJ reiterated its ultra-easy monetary policy stance, a stark contrast to peers in other developed economies where central banks have expressed concerns over inflation.As of Friday afternoon during Asia trading hours, the Japanese currency traded at 130.21 per dollar, a sharp weakening from levels near 115 it was trading at against the greenback in early March. The yen has for weeks weakened sharply against the greenback as the monetary policy outlook between Japan and the U.S. continues to diverge.On Thursday, the Japanese central bank vowed to buy unlimited amounts of bonds daily to defend its yield target.In contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve's leader has affirmed the central bank's determination to take aggressive action against inflation. The CME FedWatch tool shows markets largely expect a 50-basis-point rate hike in May.""Many people are talking in that context where the BOJ might be tweaking their … policy framework,"" said Kazuo Momma, executive economist at Mizuho Research & Technologies. ""I think it is inconceivable or very difficult for the BOJ to do anything about that.""Firstly, the differential between Japanese and U.S. rates will remain ""huge"" even if the BOJ decides to ""tweak a little bit of the interest rate,"" Momma said.Furthermore, any move in the Bank of Japan's yield curve control policy could wind up being counterproductive and introduce market speculation regarding the central bank's next moves, he warned. Yield curve control is a BOJ policy meant to stimulate the country's economy by keeping the 10-year Japanese government bond yield at around 0%.""Just one move will be very dangerous step for the BOJ to do so ... they're cautious about sending any message to responding to the market pressure,"" Momma said. ""They're going to continue to send a strong signal that they will be staying the same in terms of yield curve control."" Meanwhile, two experts told CNBC that the Bank of Japan had made the ""right move"" as its current mandate is to help the economy reach an ever-elusive inflation target.""The exchange rate is not in the mandate of Bank of Japan,"" said Takatoshi Ito, who formerly served as Japan's deputy vice minister of finance. Concerns about yen weakness should be dealt with by Japan's finance ministry instead, he said.""The interest rate yes has a impact on the exchange rate but it has also impact on [capital expenditure] and housing loans, the mortgage and other long-term assets,"" said Ito, who is currently a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. ""It's a very indirect way to have the impact on the exchange rate.""Agreeing with Ito, RMB Capital's Masakazu Hosomi said the Bank of Japan's current policy stance is in line with its focus of fighting deflation.Since 2016, the Japanese central bank has adopted negative interest rates in an attempt to reverse decades of deflation through encouraging borrowing and spending. Those efforts have had had limited impact in reaching the BOJ's 2% inflation goal, preventing it from raising interest rates.""The biggest issue in Japan has been deflation, not inflation, unlike U.S. and Europe,"" said Hosomi, a partner and portfolio manager at the firm.

2022-04-29,"China's top leaders gave little indication Friday the country would loosen its zero-Covid policy soon.Some businesses have resumed production in Shanghai and northern China. But the capital city of Beijing temporarily closed Friday a major luxury mall and non-essential businesses in one area to control an ongoing spike in cases stemming from the highly transmissible omicron variant.Specific virus control measures may ""sacrifice"" the convenience of life for some regions and people, affecting the economy in the short term for some localities, Liang Wannian, head of the Covid response expert group under the National Health Commission, said at a press conference Friday. BEIJING — China showed few signs of loosening its zero-Covid control policies as the country continued to battle its worst outbreak in two years.  Some businesses have resumed production in Shanghai and northern China. But the capital city of Beijing temporarily closed Friday a large luxury mall and non-essential businesses in one area to control an ongoing spike in cases stemming from the highly transmissible omicron variant.China's top leaders said at a meeting Friday that Covid and the Ukraine crisis have increased challenges and uncertainties for the domestic economy, according to state media. Chinese President Xi Jinping headed the economic meeting, held regularly with China's leadership, known as the Politburo.The leaders noted the mutation's new characteristics and said the country should stick to its ""dynamic zero-Covid policy,"" state media said. That implies the Covid policy will not ease in the near term, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance. He said the meeting reflects how headwinds for growth are stronger than previously expected, and noted leaders called for more policy support in order for China to achieve its GDP target of around 5.5%. Many investment banks have cut their China GDP forecast, one as low as 3.9%, in the wake of new Covid cases and controls. Mainland China reported more than 5,600 new confirmed Covid cases with symptoms for Thursday, with the majority resulting from cases in Shanghai that had previously showed no symptoms. The southeastern metropolis, home to the world's busiest port, has kept residents mostly in lockdown for more than a month in an attempt to control the local outbreak. Other parts of the country, including Beijing, have locked down neighborhoods, conducted mass virus tests and restricted travel in an attempt to control new spikes in cases.Beijing reported two new Covid cases without symptoms and 47 with symptoms — similar to the daily count for much of the last week. More than 15 other province-level regions reported new cases, including the export-heavy Shandong, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces.Specific virus control measures may ""sacrifice"" the convenience of life for some regions and people, affecting the economy in the short term for some localities, Liang Wannian, head of the Covid response expert group under the National Health Commission, said at a press conference Friday. But that will allow the largest area and number of people to work and live normally, for a cost-effective balance, he said.Liang on Friday described the virus situation in Shanghai and Beijing as seeing significant improvement. He said the dynamic zero Covid policy does not mean zero infections, as variants such as omicron mean authorities cannot ensure that no single case appears.  Shanghai has tried to allow some major businesses to resume production by releasing a list about two weeks ago with 666 companies that could get priority for restarting work.Just over a third, or 247, of the companies are foreign-funded businesses, the Ministry of Commerce said Thursday. German automaker Volkswagen and U.S. electric car company Tesla have resumed production, the ministry said, noting other foreign businesses have applied to join the second batch of whitelisted companies. The ministry said it would make every effort to ensure resumption of work.American chemicals company DuPont said Thursday all its manufacturing facilities in China were either operating under normal conditions or in a bubble. Early last week, the company said its manufacturing sites in Shanghai had yet to resume production.German chemicals giant BASF said most of its employees in Beijing have been working from home since Monday, and that most of its production sites in China, including in Shanghai, remain operational albeit with some reduced production volumes.On Monday, German automaker Volkswagen said it started to resume production at its factory on the outskirts of Shanghai, and that its factories in Changchun in northern China were ramping up production volume. The company did not respond to an update request from CNBC Thursday.Changchun city in the northern province of Jilin began resuming normal operations Thursday after weeks of lockdown, according to an official announcement.Getting truck shipments between ports and factories remains a challenge.Merchants have had to pay more for logistics costs — now about 25% of selling prices, up from 15% or 20% at the start of the pandemic — Diane Wang, founder and chairperson of Chinese e-commerce site DHgate, told CNBC on Thursday. The company primarily works with small Chinese companies selling abroad.But with existing inventory, stay-home and lockdown orders would have to last for at least three months in order to really affect the businesses, she said.  Schools in Beijing closed Friday, beginning the upcoming Labor Day holiday one day earlier. The last day of the long-weekend holiday in China is Wednesday, May 4. Many of the Covid cases in the city in the last week have been traced to schools.Major luxury goods mall Beijing SKP said Friday it would close — with no reopening date specified — after the city confirmed three Covid cases in an apartment community nearby. Beijing city government has claimed the department store's sales reached 17.7 billion yuan ($2.72 billion) in 2020 to rank first in the world.

The Central Bank of Russia has cut its key interest rate to 14% from 17% as it looks to mitigate the impact of international economic sanctions.In the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing unprecedented Western sanctions, the central bank is juggling a sharply shrinking economy and skyrocketing inflation. Economists expect a double-digit contraction for the economy, and inflation in excess of 20% in 2022.Russian inflation reached 17.6% as of April 22 and the central bank said on Friday that it expects annual inflation of between 18% and 23% this year, before slowing to between 5% and 7% in 2023 and returning to its 4% target in 2024.The central bank implemented an emergency hike of the key rate from 9.5% to 20% in February, days after the invasion of Ukraine, in a bid to support its plunging ruble currency.However, with the ruble now returning to pre-war levels, policymakers are turning their attention to recalibrating the economy in an effort to absorb the impact of punitive sanctions from international powers.

With price and financial stability risks no longer on the rise, conditions have allowed for the key rate reduction,"" the central bank said in a statement Friday.""Recent weekly data indicate a slowdown in current price growth rates on the back of a strengthening of the ruble and a cooling of consumer activity.""The bank said its inflation outlook is set to be impacted by the future of its imports and exports, as it looks to navigate the stinging sanctions, along with future fiscal policy decisions.It added that it will ""take into the account the need for a structural transformation of the economy and will ensure a return of inflation to target in 2024.""The CBR estimates that economic activity began to decline in March, as sanctions began to take effect, with high-frequency data indicating a slide in consumer and business activity.""The decline in imports due to the introduction of external trade and financial restrictions is outstripping the decline in exports,"" the CBR statement said.""Despite the gradual change in the country and commodity structure of exports and imports as new suppliers and sales markets emerge, businesses are experiencing considerable difficulties in production and logistics.""Although medium-term inflationary risks have decreased slightly, the CBR added, there are still considerable risks associated with any further escalation of external trade and financial restrictions that may be imposed on Russia by Western powers. ""The decline in the potential of Russia's economy driven by restrictions may turn out to be more pronounced than the baseline scenario assumes,"" it said.""Over a short-term horizon, the effect of proinflationary factors is likely to be accentuated by high and unanchored inflation expectations.""The central bank added that there is room for further easing this year if inflation risks continue to fall, however. Governor Elvira Nabiullina has previously stated that the CBR ""will not seek to return inflation to target at any cost,"" indicating that policymakers are willing to accept hotter inflation while focusing on restructuring the economy in the face of sanctions.""We think it's too early to read into this as a sign that the CBR is putting less emphasis on inflation targeting as the center of its policy framework, but it's clear that the central bank is thinking about how the economy will adapt to a new growth model and that it should not keep interest rates too restrictive it if hinders this transition,"" said Liam Peach, emerging Europe economist at Capital Economics, adding that further interest rate cuts toward 10% by the end of the year now look ""likely."""

2022-05-02,"The Federal Reserve plans to hike interest rates to a neutral rate in 2022, estimated to be between 2 and 3.5%The central bank hopes that swift tightening will prevent the risk of stagflation.Stagflation describes the duel threat of stagnant economic growth and persistent inflation. The Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates in an effort to defuse an explosive year of price inflation. But global forces could neutralize the effects of that tightening of monetary policy, and keep inflation high.Some observers believe the U.S. government may have misread the looming threat of inflation. During the pandemic, Uncle Sam dispersed historic sums of cash to blunt widespread economic damage. Analysts say this stimulus produced strong household savings. A boom in demand for durable goods followed.This surge in demand came as global supply chains stalled out, and a persistent bout of inflation followed. In March 2022, prices across all categories rose to historic levels, 8.5% year over year. And investors believe the price hikes aren't over yet, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey.""The only way to break the back of inflation that's running out of control is for very tight monetary policy, "" says Richard Fisher, former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ""It slows things down because everything becomes expensive.""Today's inflation isn't spiraling in the way it did in the recent past, however. From 1965 to 1982, inflation soared, at times reaching double-digit rates. In 1979, the central bank, under Chair Paul Volcker, kicked off a tightening cycle that resulted in interest rates of nearly 20%. Strong monetary policies killed inflation, but also led companies to offshore labor costs. As a result, American workers saw their labor income stagnate relative to productivity for four decades.This period in U.S. economic history is remembered for stagflation, which describes the duel threat of stagnant growth and persistent inflation.Today's Federal Reserve leaders hope to avoid such a dramatic turn of events. But their plan could backfire, as many of the root causes of inflation are outside of the bank's control.Watch the video above to learn more about the central bank's fight against stagflation."
2022-05-02,"Inflation is taking a toll on the American economy, with everything from gas to groceries seeing a steep price increase.There is little that individuals can do to avoid inflation at the cash register, but Berkshire Hathaway CEO and legendary investor Warren Buffett says that people can make certain moves to protect against its effects.Speaking at the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, Buffett repeated his long-held advice that one of the strongest protections against inflation is sharpening your skills and working to be at the top of your field.""The best thing you can do is to be exceptionally good at something,"" the 91-year-old said Saturday. Mentioning professions like doctors and lawyers as examples, Buffett said that ""[people] are going to give you some of what they produce in exchange for what you deliver."" Buffett added that skills, unlike currency, are inflation-proof. If you have a skill that is in demand, it will remain in demand no matter what the dollar is worth.""Whatever abilities you have can't be taken away from you. They can't actually be inflated away from you,"" he said. ""The best investment by far is anything that develops yourself, and it's not taxed at all.""

2022-05-03,There's a big debate obsessing global markets right now: Is a U.S. recession imminent?
2022-05-03," The Fed will hike by half a percentage point on Wednesday and again in June, according to the CNBC Fed Survey.A majority in the survey believe the Fed's tightening campaign will not achieve a soft landing, instead causing a recession.Respondents to the CNBC Fed Survey include economists, fund managers and strategists. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike interest rates and cut its balance sheet aggressively over the next 16 months, according the May CNBC Fed Survey, and most respondents believe the process will end in a recession.A rate hike of half a percentage point (50 basis points) is expected to be announced Wednesday by the Fed, the first in 22 years, followed by another one in June. After that, the panel of 30 respondents differs from fed fund futures market pricing in mostly seeing 25 basis point rate hikes.But they still see a sharp rise in rates. Respondents, who include economists, fund managers and strategists, see the funds rate hitting 2.25% by year end and rising to a terminal rate of 3.08% by August 2023. The terminal rate is 72 basis points higher than the March survey and is hit three months earlier. Rates come down after that, ending 2023 at 2.6%. The Fed is forecast to run a total of $2.7 trillion off its near $9 trillion balance sheet over 2 years and 5 months, more quickly than previously forecast. And 57% believe the fed will eventually sell assets, rather than just allowing the balance sheet to runoff.""I don't think markets appreciate that (quantitative tightening) is very aggressive, and this double-barreled tightening will be disruptive,"" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. ""A lot of rate hikes have, of course, been priced in, but we've also not yet priced in the economic impact of the most aggressive monetary tightening cycle in the post-Volcker world."" The quick pace of tightening and the stubbornness of inflation leads a majority to believe the Fed will not achieve a soft landing. Asked if the effort to bring down inflation to 2% will create a recession, 57% said it would, 33% said it would be avoided and 10% didn't know. August 2023 is the average starting month among those who think a recession is coming and 53% say it will be moderate while 43% believe it will be mild.       ""I still expect that a recession will be needed to get inflation back down to the Fed's 2% target, but the recent increase in market interest rates, in anticipation of expected tightening by the Fed, has reduced the likely severity of that recession and has slightly increased the slim chance that the Fed can pull off a soft landing,"" wrote Robert Fry, chief economist, Robert Fry Economics LLC, in response to the survey.Joel Naroff of Naroff Economics writes: ""The likelihood is that things will be worse and last longer than in most models, meaning that the Fed's ability to fashion a soft landing is highly unlikely. If it happens, it will be through sheer luck only.""For the next 12 months, the recession probability ticked up just a bit to 35% from 33% in the prior survey. The probability of recession over the next year also rose two points for Europe and stands now at 53%. Europe has been much harder hit by the economic fallout from the Ukraine war. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's overall rating has taken a hit as a result of the recent sharp change in policy and inflation outbreak. During the pandemic, respondents gave him straight A's for his economic leadership. His overall grade now is a B-. Powell's rating fell in four of eight categories with the biggest drop coming in economic forecasting. His grade for economic expertise and overall monetary policy both dropped slightly. He received better marks for leadership, transparency, and communications.""It seems incredibly odd to even remotely believe Fed Chair Powell is even a touch hawkish and has any control over inflation,"" wrote Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors. ""Inflation is the highest in 40 years, yet the real fed funds rate is historically negative. You can't fight inflation with a negative real fed funds rate.""On inflation, 74% of respondents believe it has already peaked, up from 7% in the March survey, but most don't believe that the Fed will be successful in hitting its 2% target until 2024. The CPI is forecast to end the year at 5.6%, up 4 tenths from the prior survey, and end 2023 at 3.3%, unchanged from the March survey.The growth outlook has been reduced sharply this year with GDP forecasts averaging 2.2%, down 70 basis points from March while the 2024 average fell 30 basis points to 2%. Those forecasting a recession averaged 1.6% and those who don't think the Fed's inflation fight will contract the economy came in at 2.4%.Despite calls for recession and a downgrade to growth, survey respondents see some equity upside: specifically, 5% this year and 8% next year for the S&P 500 from current levels. For the first time since we've asked the question, the CNBC Risk Reward Ratio — which nets out the possibility of a 10% increase or decrease in stocks over the next six months — is balanced at zero. It's been negative over the past five surveys. On balance, however, the group still sees stocks overvalued relative to their outlook for earnings and growth.""The current decline in equities is a correction in an ongoing bull market and will not be accompanied by an economic contraction,"" said Hugh Johnson of Hugh Johnson Economics. ""We are most likely within 4%-7% of the bottom of the correction and the upside after the correction is finished will be 4.5% -7.5%."""
2022-05-03,"The pandemic-era trend known as the ""Great Resignation"" is still red-hot, as workers enjoy the perks of record-high demand for their labor.However, economic headwinds mean those benefits may not last much longer, according to economists.A record 4.5 million workers quit their jobs in March, edging just above the previous high-water mark set in November, the U.S. Department of Labor reported Tuesday.More from Invest in You:How to know if an adjustable-rate mortgage is right for youWant a 720 credit score? Here are four ways to improve yours3 ways retirees can cope with higher prices amid ongoing inflationVoluntary separations are elevated as workers are enticed by ample choice and better pay elsewhere.There were 11.5 million job openings at the end of March, breaking December's record of more than 11.4 million openings, according to the Labor Department. Job openings reflect business' demand for workers.The layoff rate also hovered near historic lows in March, as employers clung to their respective workforces. The ration of unemployed individuals to job openings also touched its lowest on record (at 0.5 unemployed per job opening in March), according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data dating to 2007.Hourly wages grew at a 6% pace in March, higher than any level dating to at least 1997, according to data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. (The data reflects the three-month moving average of median wage growth.) ""We are seeing massive demand for workers,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at employment site ZipRecruiter. ""This is a labor market that is more of a job seeker's market than any we've seen.""The pandemic created an imbalance between the supply of workers and employer demand for labor.Demand started rising early in 2021 as Covid-19 vaccines were distributed more broadly and the U.S. economy started reopening. But workers didn't rush to fill those open jobs for many reasons, including ongoing health risks.That dynamic led employers to compete for available workers by raising wages. Employees found it easier and financially beneficial to switch jobs. Over 47 million people voluntarily left their jobs in 2021, an annual record. Initially, certain industries like leisure and hospitality experienced the tight labor market conditions most acutely, according to economists. (That industry category includes bar and restaurant jobs, which tend to be in-person and lower-paying.)However, those conditions have broadened to other segments of the economy in the last few months, according to Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at career site Glassdoor.""The high level of demand means job seekers have more opportunity to go find jobs that pay better, offer better benefits or quite simply are a better fit for them,"" Zhao said.The job seeker's market will likely moderate in coming months, though probably at a level that's still beneficial for workers, he said. However, war in Ukraine, the ongoing pandemic and Federal Reserve monetary policy are factors that may rein in the good times. The U.S. central bank is raising interest rates to cool the economy and fight persistently high inflation. Inflation has more than offset the raises many workers have gotten.""In the next few months, the hot job market isn't going anywhere,"" Zhao said.""[But] this is the time to take advantage of the tighter labor market for workers because there's no guarantee these conditions will persist,"" he added."
2022-05-04,"The nationwide quitting spree continues: 4.5 million people, or 3% of the labor force, quit their job in March, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, matching a series high from last year.Workers are feeling confident in a booming market where there are nearly two job openings for every person who wants one. As of March, the U.S. economy posted 11.5 million open jobs — nearly double the 6 million workers who were unemployed and actively looking for a job that month.This makes it the 11th consecutive month where job openings have exceeded the number of unemployed people, says Andrew Flowers, labor economist at Appcast and research director at Recruitonomics.As the U.S. enters its second year of record turnover, Flowers tells CNBC Make It the Great Resignation could be spreading to new sectors where even middle- and high-wage workers are seeking big pay raises to ease the sting of inflation. So far, much of the Great Resignation been powered by lower-wage service workers across sectors like leisure and hospitality, accommodations, food services and retail. These workers also saw some of the highest wage growth of the last year as employers raised pay and bonus offerings to fill the talent shortage.In some cases, those big raises may have been enough to beat creeping inflation, Flowers says. For example, some leisure and hospitality workers are making nearly 15% more today than a year ago, according to The Wall Street Journal, compared with the 8.5% jump in the consumer price index as of March.Now it appears the Great Resignation is spreading to other middle- and high-wage sectors, Flowers says. Quitting picked up steam in professional business services, which includes people who work in marketing and sales, legal administration and management. Inflation could play a role, Flowers adds, if these office workers didn't see big wage growth in recent months through raises or promotions. With inflation pressures continuing to eat away at paychecks, workers may be jumping ship to secure a big enough raise to soften the blow of creeping living costs.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point in an effort to curb inflation, but Flowers expects the job market to remain tight for some time.""The Great Resignation has not been about giving up on work,"" Flowers says. ""It's about getting better opportunities."" The quits rate among state and local education workers, namely public school teachers, is on the rise from 0.8% last year, to 1% in November, and 1.3% as of March.It's a small share but a worrying increase that could become an ""epidemic,"" Flowers says. ""These are typically unionized workers who enter the field and want to stay there,"" he says. The increasing turnover could be an indication of burnout as teachers continue to weather changing Covid policies with in-person, hybrid and remote learning all in flux depending on the state of the virus.More than two years into the pandemic, teachers and educators continue to be stuck in the middle of administrators, public health officials, politicians and parents about how to conduct a classroom during an ongoing viral outbreak. Despite the record level of quits and openings, Flowers says the labor supply is recovering. Roughly 6.7 million people were hired into new jobs in March.Flowers says it's important to look at the prime-age labor force participation rate, or the share of people 25 to 54 years old either working or actively looking for work, which currently sits at 82.5% — nearly a full rebound since it was 83% in February 2020.Flowers says the market disproves the notion that people just don't want to work. Rather, as they've become more comfortable with Covid risks, and at the same time seeing job openings abound, ""the open opportunities in the tight labor market is pulling people in from the sidelines. Nominal wage growth is strong, and that's enticing.""But strong wage growth won't be enough to fill the market. Flowers says addressing the talent crunch will require bigger policy changes on issues like immigration, and in the long run a closer look at worker demographics and birth rates.Check out:Tripled salaries, big bonuses, spot offers: Recruiters go into extreme hiringEven in a tight job market, recruiters say these 4 red flags will cost you the offerMeet the 25-year-old TikToker going viral for asking strangers how much money they makeJob openings and number of people quitting hit record highs—it’s ‘the pit of despair for employers’Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"
2022-05-04,"President Joe Biden touted sizable reductions in the federal deficit in the current fiscal year as part of his administration's economic savvy.While the Treasury Department estimates that this year's budget deficit will decline by $1.5 trillion, the reason for the smaller deficit is a matter of debate.Under former President Donald Trump, the U.S. poured trillions into the economy to support small businesses and help households cope with Covid-19. Many of those programs are now ending. President Joe Biden on Wednesday tried to cast his administration as spending hawks, touting sizable reductions in the federal deficit this fiscal year as a key departure from what he characterized as rampant spending by his Republican predecessor.While the Treasury Department estimates that this year's budget deficit will decline by $1.5 trillion, the reason for the smaller deficit is a matter of debate.Under former President Donald Trump, the U.S. poured trillions into the economy to lessen the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns at the height of the pandemic and to develop and manufacture vaccines, masks and other gear needed to protect health-care workers and others from the virus. As those pandemic-era programs end, the federal government will spend less — even as the Biden administration works with Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, on legislation providing another $10 billion in Covid relief.The president's more-modest budget proposal doesn't include a majority of the cost of Biden's massive Build Back Better agenda, a transportation and technology infrastructure program that Democrats haven't been able to pass. The administration priced the plan at $1.75 trillion, but it phased out some of the programs that would likely be permanent to reduce the price tag on paper. The Congressional Budget Office estimated its costs at around $4.73 trillion if the programs were permanent.The plan also would have included significant tax increases on high-income households to help pay for the programs.""We're on track to cut the federal deficit by another — another — $1.5 trillion by the end of this fiscal year, the biggest decline in a single year in American history,"" Biden said from the White House.The president has recast his economic strategy in recent months to focus on deficit reduction and stricter spending controls as dozens of his fellow Democrats face close midterm elections that will decide the composition of Congress in the final two years of his first term.Comments about the more-frugal budget plan come as the White House looks for ways to sympathize with and assist voters frustrated by skyrocketing inflation rates not seen since the 1980s.""We reduce federal borrowing, and we help combat inflation,"" he added. ""Bringing down the deficit is one way to ease inflationary pressures in an economy where the consequence of a war, and gas prices, and oil and food and — it's a different world right this moment because of Ukraine and Russia.""

2022-05-04,"The economy may be hitting a crucial turning point.Investor Peter Boockvar warns the Federal Reserve will not be able to meaningfully contain surging inflation, and there's not much more consumers can withstand.""It gets to the question: At what point does the consumer blink in the face of these rising prices,"" the Bleakley Advisory Group CIO told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Wednesday. ""On the low-end consumer, they're already beginning to blink.""A TransUnion study out this week reflects trouble among consumers with the ""riskiest credit profiles"" in the form of rising trend credit balances and delinquency rates.Boockvar believes the report is a harbinger of what's ahead. In a note out this week, he warned consumers are at a ""fork in the road.""""The consumer is going to call a timeout on spending because of the continued rise in prices,"" he wrote. ""It is inevitable as price matters to the U.S. consumer who loves discounts.""Boockvar, a Fed critic, believes all income levels are at a breaking point. He warns they're on the cusp of delaying purchases until prices cool — which would have painful consequences on the broader economy. It would put Fed Chair Jerome Powell's view that it's possible to avert a recession at risk.""This is going to be the most aggressive tightening cycle in 40-plus years between the rate hikes and the shrinking of the balance sheet,"" noted Boockvar, a CNBC contributor. ""Considering how dependent economic activity is to cheap money, how dependent markets have been to cheap money, I don't see how it's possible to achieve a soft landing.""Yet, Wall Street appeared to embraced the Fed's half point rate hike and Powell news conference. The S&P 500 saw its best day since May 2020.Boockvar expects the bounce to evaporate.""If there are low odds of a soft landing, which means we're going to have a recession, well that means that earnings numbers are going to have to come down,"" Boockvar said.Disclaimer"
2022-05-05,"  Inflation may have peaked, but it isn't going away.Even with its ""famously blunt"" tools and Fed chair Powell expressing confidence in a ""soft-ish"" landing, the Federal Reserve will not be able to keep markets from being volatile and the economy from a rocky period.The long-term outlook remains positive, but the next 18 to 24 months will be tough for businesses, according to former Fed official and former head of investing giant TIAA Roger Ferguson Anyone who read a Fed chair coining the term ""soft-ish"" for an economic landing, as Jerome Powell did on Wednesday, as a bullish signal, has a transitory understanding of how much significance to give to any single day's trading action. Stocks tanked on Thursday after the relief rally, giving up all of the post-FOMC meeting gains, and more, on pace for the worst day of 2022 for stocks.Now back to the rougher economic reality, on Main Street, small business owners likely weren't fooled by the market head fake at all. They have a sobering view of the rest of 2022. More than 80% of small business owners tell CNBC that a recession will hit the U.S. economy this year. The primary business issue they are facing is inflation, which is driving up prices they pay for raw goods and other inputs, while they are growing increasingly fearful about passing along more price increases to the consumer.The Fed's battle with inflation is not one that Main Street has much confidence in right now. Just 27% of small business owners are confident in the Federal Reserve's ability to control inflation, according to the just-released CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q2 2022, while 70% say the current Fed rate hike plans will have a negative impact on their business over the next six months.For Roger Ferguson, a former Fed vice chair and former head of investing giant TIAA, the Fed is doing what it can, but it can only do so much, and the downturn in market and economic sentiment won't reverse quickly. He recently told CNBC the risk of recession is very high. The reasons for inflation, including the supply chain disruptions, geopolitical shocks from the Russian war in Ukraine, and the strong demand from consumers in the U.S. fueled by pandemic fiscal and monetary policy, can be mitigated by a Fed that is raising rates, but not entirely controlled.Even the Fed's forecast suggests inflation above 2% for at least a couple of more years, Ferguson, who is now vice chair at The Business Council and a distinguished fellow for International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the CNBC Small Business Playbook virtual event on Thursday. ""So there should be the expectation inflation will be bit of a challenge,"" he said.He cited some financial markets indicators which expect inflation to remain ""stubbornly high"" for several years to come, and while he isn't in that camp, he added, ""it would be nice to say inflation will be behind us relatively quickly, but it will be an issue, though of lessening importance, for more than a year, perhaps two years.""He sees signs that inflation might be peaking, but has no expectation it becomes dramatically lower.""We need to get used to inflation at some elevated levels, not getting worse but not getting better,"" Ferguson said.For small businesses, this means there will continue to be specific materials and commodities where supply remains limited, and inflation high, and while it will look like inflation may be getting marginally better, that will be incremental in the macro sense, and not the case with every single input cost. Labor costs will remain high though wage inflation should begin to slow too.""Powell, in his post-meeting conference, observed that the Fed has tools, as he described, 'famously blunt' tools,"" Ferguson said.And while Powell was clear that some factors might be outside their control (such as the supply chain functioning, Covid and war), ""he was clear that he sees a credible path toward bringing inflation back down to the target of around 2%, and doing so in a way that is soft or a 'softish' landing,"" Ferguson said.Inflation will not be back at 2% soon, and the Fed has no illusions about that either, but it will slow and become less of a factor in business decisions, just not across the board, or soon.For small businesses, those who want to start a business today or are already running one, Ferguson said they should be expecting ""a pretty volatile time.""Small businesses are a huge driver of the economy and job growth, he added, and from the supply issues to labor, the long-term outlook is positive if the Fed is successful in combatting inflation. But before we know the answer to that, the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, will ""perhaps be a little rocky,"" he said."
2022-05-05,"CNBC's Jim Cramer urged long-term investors to remain calm during Thursday's stock market plunge, saying inflation appears to be peaking.""Bargains are being created by this panic,"" Cramer said, during his Investing Club's ""Monthly Meeting."" ""If you have cash like we do ... it's time to put more of that money back"" into the market.Stocks were getting crushed on concerns about rampant inflation and whether the Federal Reserve is doing enough to stamp it out.""We're not panicking,"" Cramer said. ""Inflation will not be like this three months from now,"" suggesting that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell might be able to engineer a soft landing for the economy after all.Thursday's sell-off, led by the Nasdaq's more than 4% decline, comes one day after a major rally on Wall Street that was sparked by Powell ruling out for now a potential 75 basis point hike at upcoming meetings.Central bankers increased interest rates by 50 basis points Wednesday, the biggest hike in two decades. The Fed raised rates 25 basis points in March, the first hike in more than three years.At his post-May meeting news conference, Powell also said 50 basis point hikes might be need at the next two meetings in June and July. Rate increases are also seen in the September, November and December meetings.Cramer said he thinks the intensity of Thursday's stock sell-off is related to continued selling in the bond market, which pushed the 10-year Treasury yield solidly above 3% to its highest levels since 2018.Bond yields move inversely to price.Bond investors are likely selling their holdings, Cramer suggested, because they believe Powell was wrong to say the Fed is ""not actively considering"" a 75 basis point hike while the economy faces its hottest bout of inflation since the early 1980s. The bond market moves are, in turn, triggering stock sales by algorithmic traders, Cramer said.""We think that it doesn't matter what [Powell] said. What matters are the machines, these machines that are set to trade off of a bond and we breached 3% on the 10-year. The machines know that we're testing Powell's decision to go against 75 [basis points],"" Cramer said.However, Cramer said he takes a different view and that's why he's remaining constructive during the carnage. ""We see too many instances where inflation is receding,"" Cramer said, pointing to the pullback in copper and aluminum prices as two examples.Energy prices are likely to remain elevated due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, Cramer acknowledged. On the other hand, Cramer said rising mortgage rates should cool the housing market, and he added there's signs used car demand is waning, too. ""The inputs for inflation are coming down,"" he said.Earlier Thursday, Cramer put his money where is mouth is, initiating a position in beer, wine and spirits giant Constellation Brands (STZ).

2022-05-05,"April's employment report is expected to show another month of strong job gains of about 400,000 and wage growth of 5.5% on a year over year basis.Financial markets were rattled Thursday and are worried about inflation, so the wage component could be the most important part of the report.Economists expect to see job growth begin to slow down, which might be welcome in a red hot labor market. The economy is expected to have added another 400,000 jobs in April, reflecting a very tight labor market, but economists say the number of new hires could start to slow from here.A slowdown might be welcome in light of fears that the labor market has become too hot and will only drive inflation higher -- and corporate profits potentially lower -- if wages keep rising. Recent government data show the labor shortage worsening, with the gap between job openings and available workers at a record 5.6 million in March.""The labor market continues to barrel along. We need it, at this point in time, to slow down a bit because we're going to blow past full employment and inflation is going to become a bigger problem than it already is,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""Ultimately, we need to get to something that's closer to no more than 100,000 a month.""According to Dow Jones, the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 3.5% in April, down from 3.6% in March. The April employment report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET Friday.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect employers added 400,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls, down slightly from 431,000 in March. If payrolls reach the forecast level, it would be eleventh month in a row of job creation at 400,000 or better.Wages are expected to grow at a pace of 0.4%, or 5.5% on a year-over-year basis, the same pace as the month earlier.In a turbulent financial market focused on the pace of inflation, the wage component of the report is likely to be the most important factor.Markets were rattled Thursday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that unit labor costs jumped 11.6% in the first quarter as productivity slumped. That reflects a 3.2% increase in hourly compensation on top of a 7.2% drop in productivity and was the largest four-quarter increase in unit labor costs since 1982. The productivity decline was the steepest in 75 years.""I don't think they want to see an upside surprise in wages, particularly on the heels of the labor costs number being at a 40-year high,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Global Advisors. ""I think there's a sense that even if [April's] number is really good, growth is beginning to slow and we know that jobs data is a lagging indicator...If it's weaker, we could say there's not enough workers. I think it's the wage number that people are going to focus on most, and it goes to the whole wage spiral debate.""Zandi said he does not believe wages are yet driving inflation but if the labor market does not cool, that could happen. ""Inflation is 8%. Wage growth is 5%. You don't want to see that for very long,"" he said. ""We'll start to see inflation come in and fall below wage growth as we get into next year...It's fair to say inflation is driving wages. Wages are not driving inflation, at least not yet.""If that were to happen, that's when you get the ""dreaded wage price spiral,"" said Zandi. At that point, the Federal Reserve would have to get even more aggressive with its rate hikes.""Recession risks become even greater then,"" he said. ""You don't want a boom bust economy. You want a steady as she goes economy that's operating at full tilt. That's what the Fed is striving for.""Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said the churn in the job market is one of the factors hurting productivity.""You want a more balanced situation where wages are outpacing inflation because workers are more productive, but that's not where we're at today,"" said Swonk. ""Where we're at today is eroding living standards and that's important.""Swonk said there are 1.9 job openings for every worker, up from 1.2 openings prior to the pandemic.""That's why the Fed has put the labor market in their crosshairs and talked about reducing demand, but it's hard to see how we get from 1.9 to 1.2 job openings per worker,"" said Swonk. ""It's hard to see that happening without hammering demand and increasing supply.""Fed Chairman Jerome Powell commented numerous times on the tightness in the labor market at his briefing Wednesday, following the Fed's half-point interest rate hike.""If wages and jobs are strong in the first quarter, but growth goes down that means unit labor costs go up,"" said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. ""What that starts to show is wage inflation which is what Powell was talking about yesterday.""After the productivity and labor cost data were released Thursday morning, bond yields rocketed higher. The 10-year yield Treasury yield was up about 9 basis points from Wednesday, at 3.05% in afternoon trading Thursday. A basis point equals 0.01%. The S&P 500 was down 3.6%.  "
2022-05-06,"Chinese President Xi Jinping headed a meeting of top leaders on Thursday that emphasized the country should stick to its ""dynamic zero-Covid"" policy, and warned that economic consequences would follow if it doesn't, according to state media.In contrast to a similar meeting in March, the readout did not mention how control measures should reduce the impact on the economy as much as possible, said Ting Lu, chief China economist at the Japanese investment bank Nomura.The latest meeting should be taken in the context of last Friday's Politburo meeting, and seen more as an attempt to unify the country around the zero-Covid policy, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance. BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping headed a meeting of top leaders on Thursday that emphasized the country should stick to its ""dynamic zero-Covid"" policy, and warned that economic consequences would follow if it doesn't, according to state media.The officials called on the country to unify behind the Chinese Communist Party central committee's decisions, and ""resolutely fight"" against all questioning of virus control policies, state media said.The leaders at Thursday's meeting were the central committee's Politburo standing committee — a close group of officials around Xi. Last Friday, the broader Politburo held a regular meeting that upheld the zero-Covid policy, while calling for support for the economic growth target.The last time Xi held a meeting of the standing committee about the virus in March, the readout mentioned how control measures should reduce the impact on the economy as much as possible, said Ting Lu, chief China economist at the Japanese investment bank Nomura.References to balancing such a policy with economic growth weren't included in the latest meeting's readout, he said.Thursday's meeting discussed how relaxing virus prevention and control measures would lead to large-scale infections, serious illness and death, while the economy and the safety and health of people would be seriously affected. ""We have won the battle to defend Wuhan, and can certainly win the battle to defend Shanghai,"" read the official Chinese-language meeting readout, translated by CNBC.The comments should be taken in the context of last Friday's Politburo meeting, and seen more as an attempt to unify the country around the zero-Covid policy, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, a fund manager and investment bank. ""Investors should not overinterpret or ignore either of them.""News of the meeting comes as the country continues to face its worst Covid outbreak since early 2020. The capital city of Beijing, the southeastern metropolis of Shanghai, and several smaller cities have suspended much local business and imposed travel restrictions, prompting investment banks to cut expectations for growth.China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a study in November that said shifting to the ""coexistence"" strategy of other countries would likely result in hundreds of thousands of daily cases and devastate the national medical system.""For us the critical point is really how willing they will want to be to try to implement the zero-Covid policy in a more practical manner,"" said Hong Kong-based Pierre Hoebrechts, chief investment officer at Arowana Asset Management. He said potential solutions include greater use of home quarantine and testing at home, rather than in centralized facilities.""People criticize the policy, which I think is the wrong approach,"" he said. ""If the implementation of the zero-Covid policy can be improved, everybody profits from it."" Earlier this week, Beijing city reduced the quarantine period for international travelers coming to the city by four days.The number of new daily Covid cases in mainland China has dropped significantly in the last few days.For Wednesday, the National Health Commission reported 356 new cases with symptoms, mostly in Shanghai, followed by Beijing with 55 cases. In the United States, as at April 27, the seven-day moving average of new cases was 53,133 — up 25.2% from the prior week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

2022-05-06,"Small business owners have had a few rough years.First, the Covid-19 pandemic caused many to lose revenue. Now, they're dealing with higher costs as inflation rises.The consumer price index, which measures the prices of goods and services, increased 8.5% in March from a year ago, while the producer price index, which measures prices paid by wholesalers, jumped 11.2% year over year in March.For Kate Russell, 40, co-owner of Kentucky-based Hopskinsville Brewing Company, that means everything from equipment and aluminum to grain and fuel has gotten more expensive.On average, her total costs have gone up about 15% to 20%.""We sat on that as long as we could before we finally had to just break down and raise prices,"" she said. ""We felt really bad about that. We still feel very bad about that.""Inflation, as well as supply-chain issues and workforce challenges, are weighing heavily on businesses. Some 91% said these broader economic trends are having a negative impact on their business, according to a survey of 1,107 small business owners from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices. Fully 73% said increasing energy costs are having negative impacts on their bottom lines. However, like Russell, small business owners are hesitant to raise prices, according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q2 2022.Some 75% said they are currently experiencing a rise in the cost of their supplies, yet only 40% are increasing prices. That's down from the 47% of owners who adjusted prices in the first quarter.Still, passing the cost on to consumers is the main tool small business owners are turning to, a separate survey by the National Federation of Independent Business found. They are also absorbing some of the higher costs. Some 31% are taking on debt.""Inflation is a new challenge for most small business owners that are currently operating,"" said Holly Wade, executive director of the NFIB Research Center.""They're finding it incredibly difficult to navigate having to absorb these increased prices, and also anticipating how long these price increases might last,"" Wade added.More from Invest in You:How small businesses can avoid financial misstepsWhat Americans plan to spend more money on prices go higherEmployers boost mental wellness benefits amid the Great ResignationSmall-business owners are also getting creative, looking for alternative solutions, such as reducing the quantity of goods and services offered to help stabilize costs, the survey found.It's something Jennifer Glanville, director of partnerships and collaborations at Boston Beer Company, sees in her role as head of the company's Brewing the American Dream program.The initiative partners with nonprofit lenders to help with access to capital and also offers one-on-one coaching for small business owners. Recently, the focus as been on helping them navigate higher costs.""Consumers are expecting to spend more whether we like it or not, but it's really how we how we can help position these businesses for success around that and keeping some of their other costs down,"" Glanville said.That can mean looking for efficiencies with ordering and networking as a way to find support and perhaps products and services at a reduced cost, she said. For her part, Russell is now looking at possibly cutting back on live entertainment and trivia nights to reduce expenses. She and her partner have also taken pay cuts.Fortunately, costumers aren't really complaining about the increase in prices, she said, since it's happening across the board in the economy. What they do talk about is the incredible run up in gas prices, which were up 18.3% in March from the month prior, and 48% from the previous year, the Labor Department's CPI data show. That's what is really impacting Mindy Godding, co-founder of in-home organization company Abundance Organizing, based in Richmond, Virginia. Her employees can commute up to an hour to a job. They soon found themselves spending $50 to $70 to fill up their tank.""They were really feeling pinched and frustrated,"" said Godding, who co-founded the business in 2010.""I was pretty certain we would start losing employees if we didn't act in a real definitive way,"" she added.As a band-aid, she gave employees $25 gas gift cards. A few weeks later, the company boosted the wages of their workers in the field by 25% to 30%, Godding said. To pay for it, she raised prices to consumers. Not only are there higher prices and labor issues, but rising interest rates are also putting the brakes on some long-term goals she had planned, like buying a new vehicle.""We are really getting the triple whammy right now,"" Godding said. ""It feels like we are being squeezed in every direction.""Yet for those who navigated the pandemic, they've already learned how to pivot and survive.""They've been through so much in the past 24 months,"" Glanville said.""Their ability to be creative and innovative around their business and the business needs have actually set many of these businesses up for success, even with inflation as it is.""SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

2022-05-09,"The Bank of England raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday, taking its base interest rate up to 1%. That's the highest interest rates have been since 2009 and was the BoE's fourth hike in a row. There's an economic idiosyncrasy in the U.K. that makes it ""one of the most vulnerable countries in the world right now,"" according to an investment strategist.Mike Harris, the founder of Cribstone Strategic Macro, argues that a major problem for Britain is that its mortgage market is ""heavily short-term."" While in the U.S. and in other parts of Europe citizens like long-tenure mortgages, many Brits opt for short-term loans of less than five years. Tracker mortgages are also popular which fluctuate with the Bank of England's base rate.Harris told CNBC Friday that this was an issue as rate rises would immediately trigger losses to household incomes, while it might not actually deal with the issue of inflation. He explained that the U.K. was a country that ""imports inflation,"" so the effect of interest rate hikes by the Bank of England wasn't simply a rebalancing of supply and demand that would slowly rein in consumer price growth.""Here we're actually not really dealing with a pure situation where we're trying to slow the economy, we are ultimately trying to rebalance expectations, and the U.K. is a country that imports inflation ... So we're not effectively in a position where we're free effectively to just focus on supply and demand,"" he said.He added: ""We get stuck in a situation where global inflation is driving our inflation at this stage, we have to hit the consumer and instead of just reducing the propensity to spend in the future, we're actually taking further money out of household income, which doesn't happen in the U.S.""The Bank of England raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday, taking its base interest rate up to 1%. That's the highest interest rates have been since 2009 and was the BOE's fourth hike in a row. The central bank also forecast that inflation would hit 10% this year, with soaring food and energy prices exacerbated by Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine. Harris said he had twice requested data from the Bank of England about how much lending in the country was fixed on a two-year term and how much was set for five years, but said that he was told that the central bank did not keep that information.Harris argued that it was ""absolutely insane for a central bank to not appreciate the economic impact associated with every rate hike."" He explained that consumer behavior would unlikely change a lot in five years but it would over two years. According to a data from trade association UK Finance, 1.5 million fixed-rate mortgage deals are due to expire in 2022, with another 1.5 million due to do so next year.In data released on Friday, investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown calculated that someone remortgaging at the end of a two-year fixed term deal, following the latest interest rate hike, could see their monthly payment go up by £61. If the base rate hit 1.5%, Hargreaves Lansdown worked out that could add £134 to their monthly mortgage payments. According to a survey of 2,000 U.K. adults, conducted on behalf of the platform in April, more than a third of people would struggle to afford those extra costs.Harris said that due to the current rate raises ""we're in an environment where we're probably going to destroy more demand than we should have because the Bank of England and [former governor] Mark Carney didn't do their job as they should have.""He said this dynamic was similar to that with the Federal Reserve in 2007, just before the onset of the Global Financial Crisis, as ""they were allowing people to take mortgages when they knew they couldn't repay them if house prices fell because they had to refinance so there's an inherent unsustainability.""Harris added that the U.K. was now in a stage where it was ""facing the music.""""I would say the U.K. is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world right now because of that dynamic and the fact that central bank governors didn't do anything about it, they still might have some time,"" he said, arguing that if policymakers had the means to extend this debt duration now, they should ""actively"" be doing so.A spokesperson for the Bank of England declined to comment but pointed CNBC to recent statements by Governor Andrew Bailey and Chief Economist Huw Pill.In the past, two-year fixed-term mortgage have been popular because they tend to be cheaper due to the shorter lending period. However, UK Finance said that the popularity of five-year agreements had been growing with 50% of fixed-term contracts in place in 2021 having this duration, while 45% were on two-year contracts.Bank of England data from last week showed that the ""effective"" interest rate — the actual interest rate paid — on new mortgages increased by 14 basis points to 1.73% in March — the biggest increase since at least 2016, according to Bloomberg. Speaking on CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe"" on Friday, Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill also pointed out that the spike in inflation was being driven by external shocks.He said it was ""uncomfortable"" for central bank members to be forecasting a 10% rate of inflation, which is well above the Bank's long-term target of 2%.""Of course that discomfort has to be seen in the context of the real impact of the cost of living squeeze on households and firms here in the U.K., it's more painful for them than the discomfort from a policymaker point of view,"" Pill added. He explained that the Bank of England was trying to use monetary policy to try to ensure that those drivers of inflation don't result in persistently higher prices, and create a stagflationary environment like that of the 1970s. But he said the central bank wanted to bring inflation back down to target without introducing ""unnecessary volatility into the economy.""Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore Thursday that the U.K. was seeing an ""unprecedentedly large shock to real income in this country coming from abroad,"" in terms of trade issues.Bailey also defended the central bank's more cautious approach to raising interest rates, with three dissenting members of its MPC having argued that the BOE should be more aggressive with its hikes."

Expedia CEO Peter Kern said he does not see travelers cancelling plans.The question now is if summer 2022 will be as strong as CEOs are envisioning in the face of stock market and economic turmoil. As economic pundits raise fears about a recession, the most powerful names in travel and hospitality are pushing back, pointing to bookings that illustrate a positive picture of the American consumer.""We think this summer is going to be gangbusters for travel,"" Marriott CEO Tony Capuano told last week.Marriott saw an 81% rise in first quarter revenue compared to the same quarter a year ago as more leisure and business travelers got back on the road as Covid restrictions eased.Despite concerns around inflation, Expedia CEO Peter Kern said he does not see travelers cancelling plans because there's so much pent up demand following the pandemic.That demand has driven the average daily rate at U.S. hotels up 40% compared to a year ago, according to hospitality analytics firm Smith Travel Research.""We haven't seen any signs of consumers being impacted in terms of travel spend. We all know there were pent up savings and underspend during Covid,"" said Kern to CNBC.Expedia saw its gross bookings jump 58% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, a significant jump but slightly below Wall Street estimates. As travel rebounds, publicly listed travel giants are starting to spend more on marketing and advertising – setting the stage for a competitive summer.Kern hosted a travel conference last week in Las Vegas, where the online travel operator unveiled a number of new technology updates that empower travelers with new data they can use to make smarter choices when booking a trip. Those enhancements include a price tracking tool and customized hotel scores based on guest reviews.Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel not only joined the chorus of hospitality executives reinforcing the pick-up in travel as restrictions ease, but also shared an eye-popping number: Gross bookings for this summer are tracking 15% above 2019 levels, before Covid shutdown the world.""Travel is coming back, we are all pleased. We went through a hard time for two and half years of people not being able to travel the way they wanted to,"" Fogel told CNBC. The question now is if summer 2022 will be as strong as CEOs are envisioning — or, if consumers rethink travel due to economic constraints or the prolonged volatility in the stock market.The market turmoil could eventually hurt the ""wealth effect,"" Truist Securities lodging and leisure analyst Patrick Scholes told CNBC. ""Basically if we see a sustained bear market, people feel more conservative about their ability to spend."" Things aren't that bad yet, thanks in part to the strength in the housing market, he said. ""For example, personally while my stock portfolio may be down this year, it's probably balanced out by appreciating in the value of my home,"" he added.Prior economic slowdowns have led to a drop in travel bookings. Data from STR shows that following every economic recession, Americans held back on travel leading to a decline in bookings.Pebblebrook Hotel Trust Chairman and CEO Jon Bortz doesn't think history will repeat itself. ""There is so much emotion attached to travel right now... [that] people are not going to cancel a trip to see their family for the first time in two years,"" he argued.While higher interest rates could push consumers to opt for cheaper options, executives are not seeing any evidence of that right now.Some industry experts disagree, saying they're starting to see concern to peak through.Looking beyond bookings, construction of new hotels has fallen in recent months. Over 154,000 rooms were in construction in March, which was down 15.7% from a year ago, according to STR.""Construction costs have gone up substantially due in part to wage inflation, supply constraints and higher interest rates,"" Jan Freitag, national director at the real estate research CoStar group, told CNBC."
2022-05-09,"Southeast Asia will face a ""big risk"" of social unrest if there are ""big surges"" in food prices, an ASEAN economist at Bank of America Securities told CNBC.That's because, relative to other countries, food consumption accounts for a large proportion of what people spend on in countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam, said Mohamed Faiz Nagutha. Southeast Asia will face a ""big risk"" of social unrest if there are ""big surges"" in food prices, an ASEAN economist at Bank of America Securities told CNBC.That's because, relative to other countries, food consumption accounts for a large proportion of what people spend on in countries like the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, said Mohamed Faiz Nagutha on Friday.In 2021, Filipino households spent nearly 40% of their total expenditure on food and non-alcoholic beverages, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.In comparison, U.S. households spent 8.6% of their disposable income on food, the Economic Research Service reported.""Having said this, ASEAN food inflation in particular has been a little bit less volatile (and) more contained than in the past because we depend a lot on intra-regional trade and there is a lot of government support in place to keep food inflation contained,"" Nagutha told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia.""Nonetheless, he warned that prices will eventually have to increase, though the governments are hoping the increment will be gradual.""It's usually the big shock jump that causes a lot of unhappiness on the street,"" he said. Inflation in Southeast Asia has been rising but remains low from a historical perspective, Nagutha said, though he noted the situation will change over the coming months and quarters. Regional inflation rose from 3% in February to 3.5% in March, according to FocusEconomics, an information services firm.With economies reopening and people consuming more services, demand will contribute to a rise in inflation, he said. However, this will add on to cost pressures that businesses are sitting on, and they will be looking to pass on some of these costs to consumers, he added.That, combined with energy and food inflation globally, will push overall inflation in Southeast Asia even higher, he said.However, the longer-term outlook for inflation remains uncertain because it's still unknown what prices oil and other commodities will stabilize at, Nagutha added.""In our baseline, we assume they stay high,"" he said, which will keep global inflation elevated. However, a recession is not in baseline expectations, he added. ""And for ASEAN, that means that inflation may come off from the peak, but it will still remain high relative to the historical context, and should remain high relative to where central banks want to see them,"" he said. With the exception of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, most Southeast Asian central banks have not reacted, Nagutha said.Given how far Southeast Asia has come in its Covid recovery, central banks there should be getting ready to look beyond supporting growth and looking at inflation, he added.""It's about anchoring inflation expectations and sending a signal that the policy rates that we have in ASEAN no longer are warranted given where we in the global inflation cycle,"" he said. That said, Southeast Asian central banks are slowly coming around to the tightening bias, he said, starting with a possible rate hike from the Malaysian central bank next week.""And for other ASEAN central banks, we see rate hikes from the second half of the year,"" Nagutha said.""One exception is Thailand because it has been a big laggard in terms of the growth of recovery — so we do think that they can afford to stay on hold for a bit longer,"" he added.However, Euben Paracuelles of Nomura, a financial services firm, said the Philippine central bank is also unlikely to be hiking rates this month, although it may do so in June if it sees signs of core inflation picking up.""There is no real reason to raise rates because higher interest rates did not solve higher fuel prices or higher food prices,"" Paracuelles told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""""Inflation is high in the headline basis, but if you take out energy and food, core (inflation) is much lower,"" he added."

The Moskva, a guided-missile cruiser carrying a crew of 510, was hailed as the crown jewel of Russia's Black Sea fleet before it sank on April 14.""Since the sinking of the Moskva, they have not moved their ships closer towards Odesa,"" the senior U.S. Defense official said, adding that the Pentagon has indications that Russian forces appear to be risk-averse. ""It's pretty hard to do an amphibious assault if you can't put your Marines ashore and they're not showing any indication or willingness to do that,"" the official added when asked about the strategic port city of Odesa. The official said that Russian forces still have the capability to target Odesa by airstrikes or long-range standoff missiles.— Amanda Macias  Tue, May 10 202212:30 PM EDT Ambassador Cindy McCain said that Russian forces are committing war crimes by attacking Ukraine's food supply and that the world is ""extraordinarily close"" to a new food crisis.McCain, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Food Agencies in Rome, told reporters on a conference call that Russia is using food and access to it as a weapon.""We've heard they've been stealing grain. We've heard that they emptied some of the silos. The critically cruel thing they have done is they've put landmines in most of the agricultural fields,"" McCain said when asked to provide examples of Russian forces attacking Ukraine's food supply.""I stand by what I said I think what they are doing is war crimes,"" she added.McCain said that the targeting of rail lines into Ukraine and the bombardment around the country's ports have further exacerbated food security around the world.— Amanda Macias  Tue, May 10 202211:33 AM EDT The World Health Organization's European chief said  at least 3,000 people have died in Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February because they were unable to access treatments for chronic diseases.So far, the U.N. health agency has documented some 200 attacks in Ukraine on healthcare facilities, and few hospitals are currently functioning, Hans Kluge told a regional meeting of WHO's 53 member states as well as senior agency colleagues.""Forty percent of households have at least one member in need of chronic treatment that they can no longer find, resulting in an estimated at least 3,000 premature avoidable deaths,"" he said in a speech, mentioning diseases such as HIV/AIDS and cancer.Matilda Bogner, head of the U.N. rights monitoring mission for Ukraine, said mortality rates have risen because of lack of access to care. In one cramped school basement in Yahidne, 10 older people died because it was unsafe to leave the shelter, she told a separate briefing.— Reuters  Tue, May 10 202210:58 AM EDT The European Union and U.S. accused Russia of carrying out a destructive cyberattack that crippled the networks of internet satellite company Viasat.""The cyberattack took place one hour before Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 thus facilitating the military aggression,"" the European Union wrote in a statement. ""This attack had a significant impact causing indiscriminate communication outages and disruptions across several public authorities, businesses and users in Ukraine, as well as affecting several EU Member States.""The company wrote in a March 30 statement that the malign cyber activity impacted several thousand customers located in Ukraine and tens of thousands across Europe. The European Union also warned that Russian cyberattacks targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure could ""spill over into other countries and cause systemic effects putting the security of Europe's citizens at risk.""Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote in a separate statement that Russia carried out destructive cyber activities against Ukraine in the months leading up to its invasion.— Amanda Macias  Tue, May 10 202210:34 AM EDT The nation's top intelligence chief told lawmakers that the global sanctions on Russia are crippling its economy and impacting the Kremlin's ability to finance its ongoing war in Ukraine.""We're seeing close to about we predict approximately 20% inflation in Russia that we expect that their GDP will fall about 10%, possibly even more for the course of the year,"" said Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines before the Senate Armed Services Committee.""We're also seeing how things like export controls on semiconductors and so on are affecting their defense industry. So I think that's a very significant impact, although obviously, time will tell as we move forward,"" Haines added.Haines, who oversees the nation's 17 intelligence agencies, said private-sector companies linked to oil production have also contributed to global efforts to apply pressure on Russia.— Amanda Macias  Tue, May 10 202210:13 AM EDT The United States believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long conflict in Ukraine, and a Russian victory in the Donbas in the east of the country might not end the war, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said.""We assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine, during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas,"" Haines told lawmakers.She added that Putin was counting on the Western resolve to weaken over time.— Reuters  Tue, May 10 20229:12 AM EDT From fighter jets to surveillance aircraft, the NATO alliance has placed up to 30 aircraft on patrol over the skies of its eastern flank. So far, the U.S. has committed the most types of aircraft to complement the alliance's security mission. Here's an overview of the NATO member aircraft flying the skies: Since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, NATO has also placed more than 140 warships on heightened alert. In addition, the 30-member-strong group has consistently warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that an attack on one NATO member state will be viewed as an attack on all, triggering the group's cornerstone Article 5.— Amanda Macias  Tue, May 10 20228:37 AM EDT The United Nations has confirmed 3,459 civilian deaths, including at least 238 children, in Ukraine since Russia invaded its ex-Soviet neighbor on Feb. 24.The agency also reported 3,713 civilian injuries in the conflict so far.The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the death toll in Ukraine is likely higher, because the armed conflict can delay reports.The international body said most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, as well as missiles and airstrikes.— Amanda Macias  Tue, May 10 20227:29 AM EDT Images below show first responders working at the site of a missile strike in Odesa, Ukraine. The major port city was hit by Russian missiles on Monday, killing one person and injuring five others, according to Ukrainian armed forces. -Reuters  Tue, May 10 20227:18 AM EDT  Although Russia has so far averted a historic debt default since sanctions were imposed on its foreign currency reserves, analysts believe it is delaying the inevitable.In a note last week, MSCI Research said that despite the rally for Russian bonds, ""probabilities of default implied by the credit-default-swap market were still exceptionally high across the one- and five-year horizons.""Read the full story here.—Elliot Smith  Tue, May 10 20225:46 AM EDT Reuters reported Tuesday, citing two EU officials, that the European Commission in considering new joint debt issuance to help with Ukraine's liquidity gap.The idea would be that Ukraine would get very cheap loans from the EU, with member states providing guarantees that the joint borrowing would be repaid. The anonymous officials said that the EU would be expected to raise some 10 billion euros through the joint borrowing.—Matt Clinch  Tue, May 10 20224:24 AM EDT The major Ukrainian port city of Odesa was hit by Russian missiles on Monday, killing one person and injuring five others, according to Ukrainian armed forces.In an update on Telegram, the operational command for the region said that the casualties occurred when seven missiles were fired at the city and hit a shopping center and a depot. The statement said that ""rare Soviet-style missiles were clearly used."" The attack came on the same day that the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, visited Odesa. Meanwhile in Russia, President Putin and senior Kremlin officials oversaw the ""Victory Day"" parade in Moscow. The event marks the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. — Holly Ellyatt  Tue, May 10 20223:32 AM EDT Russia has no plans to close the embassies of European countries despite the very poor state of relations between Russia and its neighbors, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko has said, according to state news agency Ria Novosti.""This is not in our tradition,"" Grushko said. ""Therefore, we believe that the work of diplomatic missions is important,"" Grushko said, in answer to the question of whether Russia could close European diplomatic missions in the region against the backdrop of Western sanctions.""We did not start a diplomatic war, a campaign of expulsions,"" the deputy head of the Russian Foreign Ministry claimed.Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 after months of building up over 100,000 troops along the shared border. Moscow has tried to justify its invasion by saying it's protecting ethnic Russians in the country and has falsely claimed Kyiv's leadership are ""Nazis.""Ukraine and geopolitical experts say Russia has created baseless justifications for the invasion as it wants to stop Ukraine's pro-Western direction, and to re-assert its power and influence over the country.— Holly Ellyatt  Tue, May 10 20223:10 AM EDT Russia's underestimation of Ukrainian resistance and its ""best case scenario"" planning have led to demonstrable operational failings, the U.K.'s Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday.Those failings prevented President Vladimir Putin from announcing significant military success in Ukraine at the Victory Day parade in Moscow on Monday.""Russia's invasion plan is highly likely to have been based on the mistaken assumption that it would encounter limited resistance and would be able to encircle and bypass population centres rapidly,"" the ministry said in its latest intelligence update on Twitter.This assumption led Russian forces to attempt to carry out the opening phase of the operation ""with a light, precise approach"" intended to achieve a rapid victory with minimal cost.""This miscalculation led to unsustainable losses and a subsequent reduction in Russia's operational focus,"" the ministry said.— Holly Ellyatt  Tue, May 10 20222:37 AM EDT The war in Ukraine is hitting both Russia and Kyiv's economy hard, with both expected to see sharp plunges in economic output, according to research from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) published Tuesday.Russia's economy, hit by international sanctions, is expected to contract 10% in 2022 while the Ukraine invasion — which has caused extensive damage to the agricultural producer's economic hubs and output — is forecast to cause Ukraine's economy to shrink by 30% this year, the EBRD said.""With the 3.4 per cent GDP growth recorded in 2021 no more than a distant memory, the war is putting Ukraine's economy under enormous stress, with the heavy devastation of infrastructure and production capacities,"" the EBRD said. It's estimated that between 30% and 50% of businesses have stopped their operations completely in Ukraine, causing about half of all employees to lose their jobs and income.That latest gross domestic product forecast for Ukraine is a downward revision of ten percentage points compared with the bank's projections released in March.Ukraine's GDP is forecast to bounce back to 25% next year, the EBRD said, but that's assuming that substantial reconstruction work is by then already underway.— Holly Ellyatt  Mon, May 9 202210:39 PM EDT At least a million Ukrainians have been ""forcibly relocated"" and sent to Russia, according to a Ukrainian human rights official cited by NBC News.""Not only are the occupiers hiding their crimes, but also relocating everyone they deem unreliable,"" said Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights.""We have proof that forceful deportation was prepared beforehand,"" Denisova said, according to NBC News. ""There are facts that confirm that Russia had directives for their districts on how many Ukrainians and where to deport them.""NBC News and CNBC were not able to confirm those claims.An estimated 20,000 Ukrainians are in ""filtration camps,"" with most being sent to Russia, while the fate of the rest remains unknown, Denisova added, NBC News said.Last month, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine documented about 109 cases of suspected detention or enforced disappearances among civilians since the invasion began.However, local officials said the figure does not represent the tens of thousands of Ukrainians who have been deported via ""filtration camps.""— Chelsea Ong  Mon, May 9 20226:24 PM EDT Just hours after the U.S. announced it would suspend tariffs on Ukrainian steel for a year, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal expressed his appreciation for the speed with which the Biden administration moved on the issue.Shmyhal said he first spoke about the tariffs with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo when he visited Washington on April 21.Less than 3 weeks later, the U.S. announced that the current 25% tariff would not be applied to steel from war-torn Ukraine for at least a year.The tariff suspension is the latest example of the White House and federal agencies slashing bureaucratic red tape in Washington in order to get money, weapons and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine.--- Christina Wilkie  Mon, May 9 20225:32 PM EDT President Joe Biden has very publicly shifted course in his quest to pass a $33 billion emergency funding package for Ukraine through Congress.""Previously, I had recommended that Congress take overdue action on much needed funding for COVID treatments, vaccines and tests, as part of the Ukraine Supplemental bill,"" Biden said in a statement.Recently, however, Biden says he was informed that Republicans in Congress are not prepared to vote to pass a Covid bill anytime soon.Given the reality of the situation, linking the two funding requests — as he had initially proposed — would have in practice meant slowing down the desperately needed money for Ukraine in order to give Congress time to debate the Covid funding.""We cannot afford delay in this vital war effort,"" Biden said. ""Hence, I am prepared to accept that these two measures move separately, so that the Ukrainian aid bill can get to my desk right away.""Biden's change of strategy was also adopted by Democratic leaders in Congress, who have said they are prepared to move quickly on a standalone Ukraine bill. It is expected to be relatively easy to pass with bipartisan support.— Christina Wilkie  Tue, May 10 20222:10 AM EDT Biden presses Congress to pass more military aid; U.S. will suspend tariffs on Ukrainian steel "
2022-05-10,"""Her Majesty's Government's priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families,"" Prince Charles told Parliament on Tuesday.Prince Charles also said the government will drive economic growth to ""improve living standards and fund sustainable investment in public services."" LONDON — The U.K. government on Tuesday vowed to focus on economic growth in order to address the country's spiraling cost of living crisis, in a Queen's Speech delivered by the monarch's son and first in line to the throne, Prince Charles.The Queen's Speech is written by the government and read out by the monarch as part of the official state opening of parliament, the formal beginning of each new parliamentary session.Prince Charles was standing in for 96-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, who was forced to pull out of the event due to mobility problems.""Her Majesty's Government's priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families,"" Prince Charles told Parliament on Tuesday.""My government will level up opportunity in all parts of the country and support more people into work. Her Majesty's ministers will continue to support the police to make the streets safer and fund the National Health Service to reduce the Covid backlogs.""""Leveling up"" was a key manifesto pledge from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and refers to efforts to address geographical inequalities across the U.K.The government also vowed to repeal and reform business regulations following the U.K.'s departure from the European Union, introducing a new Brexit Freedoms Bill that ""will enable law inherited from the European Union to be more easily amended."" An Energy Bill will be introduced with the aim of transitioning toward ""cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy,"" the speech outlined, while draft legislation will also be published to ""promote competition, strengthen consumer rights and protect households.""Prince Charles also said the government will drive economic growth to ""improve living standards and fund sustainable investment in public services.""""This will be underpinned by a responsible approach to the public finances, reducing debt while reforming and cutting taxes,"" he added.Members of Parliament on Tuesday will return to the House of Commons for a supplementary statement from Johnson, expanding on the legislative announcements included in the Queen's Speech, and a debate at 2:30 p.m. London time.ReactionThe Confederation of British Industry said companies looking to the government to address the cost of living crisis by growing the economy would be ""encouraged"" by Tuesday's announcements.""The focus on infrastructure, energy security, and skills all lay the foundations for sustainable, longer-term growth. And reaching for smarter, better regulation will ensure the U.K. remains world-leading in finance and put us at the front of the pack to make the most of emerging technologies,"" said CBI Chief U.K. Policy Director Matthew Fell. ""But alongside ambition, what's needed now is a relentless focus on delivery. Ahead of the Autumn Budget, the Government should remain laser focused on unlocking the investment needed to grow the economy and address the cost-of-living crisis.""The Resolution Foundation, a British think tank focusing on improving living standards for those on low to middle incomes, agreed with the focus on stronger economic growth, but said the U.K. needs a new economic strategy to address its present challenges.The think tank highlighted that economic performance among advanced economies has been poor over the past decade, but ""particularly so for the U.K.,"" which has fallen further behind the U.S., France and Germany.""Second, the economic stagnation we've experienced has led to a lack of real wage growth. By the end of this parliament, average earnings are forecast to be just £2 a week higher than they were before the financial crisis,"" the foundation said in a series of tweets.""Third, this all amounts to a terrible parliament for living standards (as measured by real household disposable incomes). The worst parliament on record in fact. This has to be turned around.""The Resolution Foundation argued that a new economic strategy would need to address the challenges over the next decade of moving to net zero, along with the current stagnation, and suggested that neither the Government nor any major political party has yet outlined such an overall strategy."
2022-05-10,"President Joe Biden said that cooling prices are his top domestic priority, even as Wall Street braces for another inflation report north of 8%.The president also said that the White House is in the middle of a review of tariffs imposed against China during former President Donald Trump's tenure and could opt to drop them.Wall Street is eager to read the Labor Department's upcoming report on April inflation , which the government will publish Wednesday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET. President Joe Biden said he could drop some of the tariffs imposed against Chinese imports to help control rising consumer prices in the U.S. — just as Wall Street braces for another inflation report north of 8%.The White House is reviewing the penalties imposed under former President Donald Trump — which raised prices on everything from diapers to clothing and furniture — and could opt to remove them altogether, Biden said in addressing the nation from Washington on Tuesday.""We're looking at what would have the most positive impact,"" Biden said, adding that removing the tariffs was currently under discussion.Trump levied a raft of financial penalties on Chinese goods in a long-running tit-for-tat trade war with Beijing in an effort to bolster American-made goods.The extent to which removing Trump's taxes on Chinese products would cool inflation is a matter of debate among economists, but many say easing or removing the tariffs altogether is among the few options available to a White House eager to pull every lever available to ease costs.The president reiterated that a combination of Covid-19 protocols at home and abroad and Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has caused prices in the U.S. to jump at their fastest pace since the early 1980s.""I want every American to know that I am taking inflation very seriously,"" Biden said. ""The first cause of inflation is a once-in-a-century pandemic. Not only did it shut down our global economy, it threw supply chains and demand completely out of whack."" ""And this year we have a second cause: Mr. Putin's war in Ukraine,"" he added, referring to the dramatic rise in oil prices sparked by Moscow's attack earlier in 2022.While West Texas crude futures are well off highs of over $130 a barrel seen in March, oil contracts for June delivery were last seen trading around $100, about $30 above where they began the year.The president noted that the war has also driven up the prices of contracts for key food products such as wheat and corn, which are up 40% and 30%, respectively, in 2022. Russia and Ukraine together supply more than a quarter of the world's wheat.

Tim Scott of South Carolina files paperwork to run for presidentG-7 leaders commit to more Russia sanctions with Ukraine's Zelenskyy set to attend summit Economists say the combination of the pandemic — especially China's recent, and severe, efforts to curb rising cases there — and the war in Ukraine are both to blame for inflation's 8.5% rise over the last year through March, the highest reading since 1981. Wall Street is eager to read the Labor Department's upcoming report on April inflation, which is scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.Economists polled by Dow Jones expect that report to show inflation rose 8.1% in the 12 months ending in April.Biden's comments the day before the release is the administration's latest attempt to convince the American public that the White House is exploring all options available to quell rising prices. Dozens of polls have indicated that Americans now believe inflation is the chief issue facing the U.S. and a threat to the economic recovery from the Covid recession. While some economic measures have staged remarkable rebounds — the U.S. employment rate held steady at a low 3.6% last month — higher gas and grocery bills continue to erode paychecks and spark angst across the country.Biden has in recent weeks sought to pacify those frustrations through regular speeches.Last week, he touted sizable reductions in the federal deficit this fiscal year as a key departure from what he characterized as rampant spending by his Republican predecessor and a step toward fiscal responsibility and lower prices.Republicans argue that the rash of inflation is, in large part, thanks to the Democrats' ambitious economic policies, including trillions in Covid relief in the American Rescue Plan as well as the bipartisan infrastructure law Biden signed in 2021.The GOP also points out that federal spending might have been higher, and the expected deficit larger, if Biden and his Democratic colleagues had managed to pass a suite of climate, housing and workforce legislation once known as the Build Back Better plan.Those attacks pose a political problem for Democrats as they face an uphill battle to retain control of Congress in November's key midterm elections. The Senate is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, while the House is divvyed 221-209 in favor of Democrats.Biden in his recent comments has countered Republican barbs by trumpeting the administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs and to raise taxes on only the richest Americans.""What's the congressional Republican plan? They don't want to solve inflation by lowering your costs. They want to solve it by raising your taxes and lowering your income,"" Biden said Tuesday. ""Their plan is actually going to make working families poorer."""
2022-05-11,"At last, consumers are starting to see some relief: The rate of inflation for consumer prices declined in April, according to highly-anticipated Labor Department data published Wednesday.The overall year-over-year price of consumer goods and services is now 8.3%, a 0.2% drop from March's 40-year high, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI). That's a slightly slower deceleration than some observers expected: Ahead of the Labor Department's data release, 52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected an median estimated inflation rate of 8.1%.The slowdown is partially driven by energy prices, which declined 2.7% in April after rising 11% percent in March. Gasoline prices fell 6.1%, as did used vehicles and clothing, which dropped 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively.Falling prices on these products is good news for consumers — especially for gas prices, which have nearly doubled in the last year. The CPI numbers suggest that despite recent gas price surges, there are limits to how quickly those prices can grow.Meanwhile, core inflation — which excludes typically volatile food and gas prices — doubled last month, going from 0.3% in March to 0.6% in April. The cost of shelter, food, airline fares, and new vehicles were the largest contributors to the all-items increase, according to the Labor Department.In other words, pandemic-related supply chain issues and labor shortages are likely still a problem. Even if inflation has now peaked, a slower-than-expected slowdown implies that taming inflation will take longer than expected.To reduce inflation down to a benchmark target rate of 2%, the Federal Reserve announced interest rate hikes in March and May, with five more likely to come in 2022. These hikes increase the cost of borrowing, which can slow down economic growth.Hikes also tend to negatively affect the stock market, which is why investors look for signs that inflation is under control. If inflation is slowing, aggressive rate hikes beyond 0.25% increments are less likely — but the Fed has already suggested that 0.50% hikes could happen in June and July.""There's good things and bad things in the report,"" says Tim Mahedy, a senior economist at global accounting firm KPMG. Reduced inflation, especially for gas prices, are good — but increased core inflation is a nagging concern, he says.""For this report, I was holding my breath. And I was left holding my breath for next month's [report], because there's not enough there to make me think [inflation is] going one way or the other,"" he says. ""If we don't get inflation below 8% in May, then I'll start to get concerned.""Barring unforeseen events, Mahedy says, a recession in 2022 is ""very unlikely"" despite widespread concerns. Consumer demand for goods and services remains very strong, and isn't expected to contract for the rest of 2022, according to his projections.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: This is the reason why Kevin O'Leary doesn't hire 'workaholics'"
2022-05-11,"If the Supreme Court chooses to repeal Roe v. Wade — effectively removing nearly 50 years of federal protections for abortion — it could be catastrophic for the economy, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned on Tuesday. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey asked Yellen what the economic consequences of overturning the ruling would be during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, NBC reports. ""I believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades,"" Yellen, who is the first woman to lead the Treasury, said. Yellen added that research has shown how having access to abortion has allowed women to plan ""fulfilling and satisfying"" lives, in addition to improving the well-being of children. Denying women access to abortion, however, could increase their odds of living in poverty or on public assistance. Yellen's comments come one week after a draft Supreme Court decision on Mississippi's strict abortion law was published by Politico. ""We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the 98-page draft decision, according to Politico's report. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed the authenticity of the draft.If the draft is adopted before the court's term ends in about two months, states would be able to restrict when and how people have abortions without the federal courts' say, CNBC reports.Recent research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that women who were denied an abortion experienced ""a large increase in financial distress that is sustained for several years,"" including a substantial increase in the rate of evictions, bankruptcies and other negative financial events. While such research focuses on women, it's important to note that transgender men, gender non-conforming people and others get abortions, too. ""It enabled many women to finish school,"" Yellen said of Roe v. Wade. ""That increased their earning potential. It allowed women to plan and balance their families and careers. And research also shows that it had a favorable impact on the well-being and earnings of children.""Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina challenged Yellen's stance during Tuesday's meeting, saying that framing the abortion debate around economic consequences was ""harsh."" ""I think people can disagree on the issue of being pro-life or pro-abortion,"" Scott said, adding that he was raised by a Black single mother. ""But in the end, I think framing it in the context of labor force participation, it just feels callous to me."" Yellen pointed out that abortions, in many cases, benefit adolescents, ""particularly low-income and often Black, who aren't in a position to be able to care for children"" or have unwanted pregnancies. ""It deprives them of the ability often to continue their education to later participate in the workforce,"" she said. Women are still struggling to recover from the devastating economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic: There are still close to one million fewer women working or actively seeking a new job than in February 2020, and women account for 70% of the jobs lost in the last two years, according to recent research from the National Women's Law Center. ""So there is a spillover into labor force participation, but it means the children will grow up in poverty and do worse themselves,"" Yellen said.

2022-05-11,"Protesters and a key trade group in Sri Lanka called for a new government to take control of the crisis-hit country on Tuesday while the president asked for calm following clashes that claimed eight lives and prompted his brother to quit as prime minister. Sri Lanka has been suffering its worst economic crisis in history, with a severe shortage of foreign exchange stalling essential imports, including drugs and fuel. For months, its tottering economy has been largely supported by India, which has provided assistance of more than $3.5 billion as the country began much-delayed talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a rescue package and also sought help from China.  Protesters and a key trade group in Sri Lanka called for a new government to take control of the crisis-hit country on Tuesday while the president asked for calm following clashes that claimed eight lives and prompted his brother to quit as prime minister. Sri Lanka has been suffering its worst economic crisis in history, with a severe shortage of foreign exchange stalling essential imports, including drugs and fuel. For months, its tottering economy has been largely supported by India, which has provided assistance of more than $3.5 billion as the country began much-delayed talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a rescue package and also sought help from China. China and India have long jostled for influence over Sri Lanka, a strategically located island situated off the southern tip of India with a population of 22 million people. But the public's patience ran out on Monday after ruling party supporters attacked an anti-government protest camp in the commercial capital Colombo, triggering a bout of clashes in which eight people died and more than 200 were injured. Hours after the violence erupted, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned in the hope of forming a unity government and the police imposed a nationwide curfew until 7 a.m. on Wednesday. The country's Cabinet stepped down. Protesters angered by persistent shortages of fuel, cooking gas and electricity defied the curfew to attack government figures, setting ablaze homes, shops and businesses belonging to ruling party lawmakers and provincial politicians. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former prime minister's younger brother, urged an end to the violence and his government outlined broad powers for the military and police to detain and question people without arrest warrants.  ""All efforts will be made to restore political stability through consensus, within constitutional mandate & to resolve economic crisis,"" the president said in a tweet. IMF Sri Lanka mission chief Masahiro Nozaki said that virtual technical talks with Sri Lankan officials over a loan package that started on Monday would continue ""so as to be fully prepared for policy discussions once a new government has been formed."" Nozaki said in a statement that he was concerned about rising violence in the island country but remained ""committed to assist Sri Lanka in line with the IMF's policies.""  The country's defense ministry ordered troops to shoot at any persons damaging public property or threatening lives. But protesters continued rallying for the president to quit, including at the ""Gota Go Gama"" tent village that was attacked by ruling party supporters on Tuesday.  ""Now the whole island is supporting us,"" said Lahiru Fernando, 36, who has camped at the anti-government protest site for weeks. ""They kicked the wrong generation."" Some experts said that if the president decides to step down in the face of growing pressure, the constitution outlines provisions for parliament to vote in a new leader. ""So, there will not be a power vacuum. There are also provisions for parliamentarians to appoint an interim government,"" said Bhavani Fonseka, a senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives think tank. The Joint Apparel Association Forum, which represents the Sri Lanka's economically vital apparel industry, appealed for political stability in Sri Lanka, where the government imposed a state of emergency late last week. ""It is critical that a new government be appointed urgently to fill the current political vacuum,"" the forum said in a statement.  U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters Washington was concerned by the deployment of the military and said the United States was deeply concerned about reports of violence against peaceful protesters. Price called for a full investigation, arrest and prosecution of anyone instigating and involved in acts of violence and urged the government to address the Sri Lankan people's discontent. ""We stress that peaceful protesters should never be subject to violence or intimidation, whether that's on the part of the military force or civilian union units,"" he said.  The attacks on government figures were in apparent reprisal for an incident just hours before the prime minister's resignation. The prime minister spoke to hundreds of supporters gathered at his official residence on Monday following reports he was considering stepping down.  After his remarks, many of them, some armed with iron bars, stormed a camp of those protesting against the government, beating them and setting fire to their tents. Police fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse the skirmishers, after having initially done little to hold back the government supporters, according to Reuters witnesses. Thousands streamed into the streets in celebration after Rajapaksa's resignation, but the mood quickly became tense. Protesters tried to tear down the gates of Temple Trees, his residence in the center of Colombo, where broken glass and discarded footwear littered the surrounding streets on Tuesday, after some of the night's worst clashes. Military troops patrolled the area, where eight torched vehicles lay partially submerged in a lake. Discarded files and smashed equipment littered the ransacked offices of government officials. In all, a police statement said 38 houses and 47 vehicles were set on fire across the country. "
2022-05-12,"Britain's economy shrank by 0.1% in March but expanded by 0.8% for the first quarter of 2022 as a whole, official figures showed on Thursday in what is likely to have been a high point for 2022 as the cost of living crisis increasingly bites.Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected gross domestic product (GDP) to be flat in March and to have grown 1.0% over the first three months of this year, compared with the final quarter of 2021.The fall in GDP was led by a 0.2% fall in output from Britain's dominant services sector.Britain's economy shrank by a historic 9.3% in 2020 and grew by 7.4% in 2021, the sharpest swing in output of any G7 economy during the Covid-19 pandemic.Overall GDP, on a monthly basis is now 1.2% above its pre-COVID level in February 2020.    However economists see Britain at a growing risk of slipping back into recession, as the war in Ukraine exacerbates existing post-pandemic pressures, which the Bank of England has forecast will push inflation above 10% by the end of this year.Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is under political pressure to provide more support to households to tackle soaring bills for energy and other essentials which have already caused a near-record fall in consumer sentiment. On Wednesday, Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), a think-tank, forecast British GDP would fall in the third and fourth quarters of this year, meeting the technical definition of a recession.Last month the International Monetary Fund predicted Britain would see the weakest growth and highest inflation of any major advanced economy next year.

2022-05-12,"The war in Ukraine and a sluggish economy could add to Google's challenges this year.""We definitely see uncertainty ahead, like everyone else,"" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told CNBC.Alphabet's stock has fallen 21% this year, slumping along with the rest of the tech sector. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that while consumers are putting the Covid pandemic in the rearview mirror, the economy is clearly a growing concern for the company and the broader market.""We definitely see uncertainty ahead, like everyone else,"" Pichai told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa in an interview on Wednesday at Google's annual I/O conference in Mountain View, California. ""The good thing is we've been around as a company for a while. [We] have worked through past moments like this, be it 2008 or the early days of the pandemic, and we take a long-term view.""He also said he thought the economy would ""take time to work through"" the current high rate of inflation.""What gives uncertainty is there are so many different factors, be it supply chain issues or be it rising energy prices,"" Pichai said.""I do think people are seeing relief in certain sectors,"" he suggested, pointing to travel as an example. ""But then you have other new areas which are showing problems, maybe due to supply chain constraints. ... Energy has been an issue, as an example. In some cases rentals have gone up, and food prices.""Watch the full interview on CNBC Pro.The Nasdaq is headed for its steepest quarterly drop since the end of 2008, when the economy was in the throes of the housing crisis. Consumer prices jumped 8.3% in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday, higher than expected and close to their 40-year high of 8.5%.Shares of Google parent Alphabet have fallen about 22% this year, plummeting alongside the rest of the tech sector as fears of inflation and higher interest rates push investors into assets that are viewed as safer during a potential downturn.Alphabet's earnings in late April fell short of analysts' estimates, largely due to a big miss at YouTube, which was hammered along with other digital ad companies in the first quarter. Executives pointed to weaker YouTube ad spending in Europe after Russia invaded Ukraine in February.""Obviously, when you're serving [ads] across the economy ... a lot of the macroeconomic factors like GDP growth end up affecting advertiser spend as well,"" Pichai said.He said the economic story isn't all doom and gloom. Building on comments last month from Alphabet Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, Pichai noted that people are again on the move, an important indication for Google's core advertising unit.""We definitely see travel recovering,"" Pichai said. ""There are signs that people are clearly moving post the pandemic, and so there is some return to normalcy. But what gives the uncertainty is there are so many different factors, be it supply chain issues or be it rising energy prices. And so trying to add all of that up together is where uncertainty is.""Pichai pointed to the company's technology investments as a vital way to keep its business strong through times of weakness, and did not indicate the company is planning to slow hiring or draw back in particular areas.""We want to be resilient in moments like this. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead. And so we are investing. We are continuing to hire, bringing in great talent. There are areas where we are seeing a secular transformation, like cloud and the transformation to digital. So [we] are continuing to invest.""Alphabet boosted research and development spending by 22% in the first quarter from a year earlier to $9.1 billion, despite economic uncertainty and market volatility.He also mentioned the company's diversification across many business lines as a source of strength.""We invest in foundational technologies and we are in many areas. So in some ways, we are diversified. Obviously, we have important products like search and YouTube. We have computing products involving Android, Play and our hardware devices. And cloud is a big area of opportunity for us as well. So I think we are exposed to many, many sectors. And we do this globally as a company. And I think that allows us to take a long-term view and think through these phases."" Google kicked off its conference on Wednesday by announcing new smartphones and teasing augmented reality glasses that use artificial intelligence to translate spoken words into text on screen. Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft are also working on AR devices.Google has to spend to keep up with competitors in a market that's rapidly evolving, particularly with the emergence of short video service TikTok, which is immensely popular among younger consumers. Google's response to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, is growing quickly, attracting more than 30 billion daily views as of late April, up from 15 billion in January.""We have to respond to what users are asking for,"" Pichai said. ""We are trying to give them the best experience, and so we feel challenged to do better.""He also highlighted ""things like Snapchat, Pinterest — all of this didn't exist a few years ago,"" and said that smartphones and the mobile ecosystem are creating all sorts of new opportunities.""We always have to be nimble, and we have to adapt, and that's how it feels every Monday when I come to work,"" he said. He also addressed the balance of free speech versus content moderation on the internet, which has come under new attention lately with Elon Musk's planned acquisition of Twitter.""I grew up in a large democracy, and the importance of free speech and giving people a voice I think is really foundational,"" said Pichai, who was born in India. ""Search represents what's on the web today. We only take down stuff that is against the law.""He added: ""In a product like YouTube, where we recommend and where we can amplify content, we do have community guidelines. So we have clearly stated policies. And we take action. And that's what actually allows us to maximize free speech, [to] help keep the platform safe for everyone involved.""He also spoke a bit about the company's approach to content moderation. ""I think it's important to give people a sense of transparency. And there are many ways to accomplish that. For example, we publish our community guidelines, or in the case of search, how our raters evaluate for search quality, we publish that publicly."" He added, ""I think it's important to do it in a way in which spammers and others who are trying to work around your products are not able to do as well.""As far as Musk's plans for Twitter, he said: ""I'm an avid user of Twitter. I think it's an extraordinarily important product for the world. I've gotten a lot out of it. And I think there is value in investing in it for the long term ... I think that is important because it plays an important role in democratic society ... I would like to see the product continue to get better."""

2022-05-13,"The port city of Durban and the wider KwaZulu-Natal province in eastern South Africa were besieged by the country's worst flash flooding for decades in April.The manufacturing PMI — having soared to a record high of 60.0 in March — slumped to 50.7 in April, its lowest reading since the violent riots following former President Jacob Zuma's arrest in July.Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan has cautioned that Eskom could resort to stage 8 load shedding, which would entail blackouts for up to 12 hours a day, in order to avert a total collapse of the country's electricity grid. South Africa's economy picked up momentum in the first quarter of the year, but historic flooding in a key province and the threat of unprecedented power cuts are putting the brakes on its recovery.The port city of Durban and the wider KwaZulu-Natal province in eastern South Africa were besieged by the country's worst flash flooding for decades in April, which killed hundreds and throttled freight operations at sub-Saharan Africa's busiest port.The Absa/BER manufacturing PMI — having soared to a record high of 60.0 in March — slumped to 50.7 in April, its lowest reading since the violent riots following former President Jacob Zuma's arrest in July last year.KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa's second-most populous province, was also the center of the country's worst riots since the end of apartheid.The S&P Global composite PMI also fell to a four-month low, and in a note last week, Capital Economics highlighted that high frequency data indicates that the recovery in mobility has stalled.The figures for the first quarter paint a mixed picture, according to JPMorgan economists Sthembiso Nkalanga and Sonja Keller, but point to a seasonally adjusted quarterly GDP growth of 3.5%.However, April's dismal PMI showing poses downside risk to JPMorgan's 1.5% GDP growth projection for the second quarter. Alongside the global backdrop of the war in Ukraine, soaring inflation and Chinese supply struggles, South Africa is also dealing with the domestic shocks of flooding and electricity rationing.Much of the decline in the manufacturing PMI was concentrated on port and manufacturing activity in KwaZulu-Natal, where manufacturing activity dropped from 60.5 in March to 39.6 in April.Load shedding — the deliberate shutdown of power in parts of an electricity system to prevent its failure when overburdened — scaled up significantly in April, with electricity cuts this year projected to exceed the already substantial quantities seen in 2021. Even as the floods have largely abated, electricity supply cuts pose a consistent problem for the South African economy.State-owned utility Eskom's electricity availability factor — which measures the available electricity as a share of maximum amount of electricity that could be produced — has been stuck near record lows in recent weeks, noted Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan has cautioned that Eskom could resort to stage 8 load shedding, which would entail blackouts for up to 12 hours a day, in order to avert a total collapse of the country's electricity grid.""Some shocks such as the flooding are clearly outside of the government's control but, even without these, the recovery will continue to be held back so long as issues such as those affecting the electricity sector remain unresolved,"" Tuvey said.The International Monetary Fund is projecting real GDP growth, adjusted for inflation, of 1.9% for South Africa in 2022.Eskom on Thursday announced the implementation of stage 2 load shedding between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. local time.""The onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to capacity constraints throughout this period, particularly during the evening and morning peaks. Unfortunately, this would generally require the implementation of loadshedding during the evening peaks,"" it said in a statement.Eskom reiterated that loadshedding is a ""last resort to protect the national grid"" and urged South Africans to continue using electricity ""sparingly,"" particularly in the early mornings and evenings.Possible Q2 contractionThe government declared a state of disaster in response to the floods and has begun efforts to repair the damage.""Yet, we expect the April slide to reverse more slowly than the swift rebound seen after the unrest last July, given the damage to road infrastructure, as well as the delays at the ports,"" JPMorgan's Nkalanga and Keller said in their latest research note.""Meanwhile, energy availability is down significantly this year, raising the risks of prolonged power cuts, while the consumer resiliency that likely led the GDP growth in 1Q should fade this quarter due to a purchasing power squeeze.""Against this backdrop and the sensitivity of the South African economy to changes in external market conditions, including global supply chain problems, a potential growth slowdown in China and the war in Ukraine, JPMorgan sees ""increased risk of slower GDP growth or even a contraction this quarter."""

2022-05-16,"Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said the central bank erred in waiting to address inflation.""One of the reasons was that they wanted not to shock the market,"" he told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.Bernanke spoke a day ahead of his latest book release, which addresses Federal Reserve policy moves during the 21st century. Former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke said the central bank erred in waiting to address an inflation problem that has turned into the worst episode in U.S. financial history since the early 1980s.Bernanke, who guided the Fed through the financial crisis that exploded in 2008 and presided over unprecedented monetary policy expansion, told CNBC that the issue of when action should have been taken to tame inflation is ""complicated.""""The question is why did they delay that. ... Why did they delay their response? I think in retrospect, yes, it was a mistake,"" he told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an interview that aired during Monday's ""Squawk Box"" show. ""And I think they agree it was a mistake.""Like the Bernanke-era Fed, the Jerome Powell-led central bank was called on to take aggressive action when the Covid pandemic hit in March 2020. Much of the response was patterned after the financial crisis moves, but to an even larger degree.It kept that historically loose policy in place well after the economy recovered from the crisis.Now, the Fed is tightening policy with rate hikes and a reduction of its bond holdings that will start in June. However, the Fed is facing criticism that it waited too long to pull back and now confronts inflation running at an 8.3% annual pace.Bernanke said he understands why the Powell-led Fed waited.""One of the reasons was that they wanted not to shock the market,"" he said. ""Jay Powell was on my board during the Taper Tantrum in 2013, which was a very unpleasant experience. He wanted to avoid that kind of thing by giving people as much warning as possible. And so that gradualism was one of several reasons why the Fed didn't respond more quickly to the inflationary pressure in the middle of 2021."" In late summer of 2020, the Fed changed its policy framework to indicate that it would allow inflation to run hotter than normal in the interest of assuring a complete and inclusive jobs recovery.When inflation began running higher than the 2% target in the spring of 2021, policymakers said they expected it to be ""transitory"" due to pandemic-specific factors that would abate. In recent days, several Fed officials have defended their response, saying that when it became clearer that inflation was more persistent, they began using ""forward guidance"" to tell the market that tighter policy was coming.One thing the Fed has going for it is that while the current inflation run is drawing comparisons to the hyperinflation of the late 1970s and early '80s, it is different from the last time price increases were this high, Bernanke added.What's more, the current central bank has more credibility as an inflation fighter, and there's more public support for rate hikes.""There's a lot of support for the fact that the Fed is tightening now, even though obviously we see the effects in markets,"" Bernanke said. ""You know, we'll see the effects in house prices, etc. So those are some ways in which the current situation I think is better because we learned a lot from the '70s.""Bernanke's new book is ""21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19"" and will be released officially Tuesday."

But he added that this could be the ""beginning of the emergence of a reformist, non-sectarian opposition in Lebanon.""Turnout was low at 41%, according to Interior Ministry figures, compared to 2018 which saw nearly a 50% voter turnout.

Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke is out with a new book this week. It's titled, ""21st Century Monetary Policy: Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19."" In an exclusive TV interview, I spoke with Ben Bernanke at his home in Washington, DC. I started out by asking him about the comparison of the great inflation of the 1970s to where we are today and how he thinks about it if we're, if he were in this seat now.BEN BERNANKE: Well there are some big differences between the 70s and today and one of course being that the inflation in the 70s lasted for more than a decade. It was much higher than we have now so it was a, it was a worse episode. But I think the most important things, first of all, that the Federal Reserve has to take the lead. Arthur Burns, who was chair of the Fed in the 70s felt that other parts of the government, you know, should take the lead on inflation. Secondly, that you have to worry a lot about credibility and inflation expectations. The Fed's credibility was completely shattered in the 70s. Nobody believed that the Fed was going to take action against inflation. And so, when Paul Volcker did, I mean he had a lot of credibility, but it wasn't enough and that was part of the reason why the recession which followed his tightening was so much greater. And I think the third lesson from the 70s is that political interference with Fed policy can be very dangerous. In the 70s, Arthur burns again acted more or less as a member of the Nixon administration and Nixon wanted to be reelected in 1972 and so Arthur Burns said, well, we won't tighten monetary policy then and that led to greater inflation. We have I think today both a more independent central bank and also I'm actually pleasantly surprised if you look at Congress and the President and so on, you're not seeing a lot of people saying the Fed should not be doing anything about this inflation. There's a lot of support for the fact that the Fed is tightening now even though obviously we see the effects in markets, you know, we'll see the effects in house prices, etc. So those are some ways in which the current situation I think is better because we learned a lot from the 70s.SORKIN: And does that mean that we've acknowledged that actually you said the Fed should lead this. Is it because there is no other tool?BERNANKE: Well, in theory, the fiscal authorities could play a role. That is, this is what modern monetary theory says, you know, that by raising taxes and cutting spending and reducing aggregate demand and so on, the fiscal authorities could play the same kind of role as the Fed which basically reduce demand and get inflation down. Unfortunately, the Fed is just a lot more nimble and a lot better informed about markets and so on and it can respond quickly and it can provide guidance about its long run policy goals, etc. You know, for there are many advantages to fiscal policy, but nimbleness is not one of them. It takes a long time to come to agreement. only under very extreme circumstances does Congress really react in a powerful way so from a political economy point of view, I think the Fed really is the only game in town.SORKIN: I asked Ben Bernanke whether he thinks that with transparency and the forward guidance that effectively comes with that, if it locks in the Fed, for example, the most recent case of the 50 basis point raise, rate hike.BERNANKE: There's no strategy that doesn't have occasional downsides. I think the clearest case in most recent period is that the Fed said they weren't gonna begin to raise rates until certain criteria were met, first of all, secondly, until they had QE had gotten to a certain point and they were going to taper first, etc, etc. So the forward guidance, I think, overall, on the margin slowed the response of the fed to the inflation problem last year to some extent.SORKIN: So does that mean it was a mistake?BERNANKE: Well, they were they had different. So this is a complicated question. The question is, why did they delay that? I think that why did they delay their response. I think, in retrospect, yes, it was a mistake, and I think they agree it was a mistake. There were a number of reasons for it. One of the reasons was that they wanted not to shock the market. They wanted to avoid, Jay Powell was on my board during the taper tantrum in 2013 which was a very unpleasant experience, he wanted to avoid that kind of thing by giving people as much warning as possible. And so that gradualism was one of several reasons why the Fed didn't respond more quickly to the inflationary pressure in the middle of 2021. There were other reasons as well.SORKIN: What do you think?BERNANKE: Well, one of them was that in early 2021 after the American Rescue Plan was passed and this was something like $2.8 trillion dollars of new federal spending between the American Rescue Plan and the December program, you know, the Fed could have responded to that point but they looked around and said, well, look, there's still a lot of slack because the unemployment rate was still close to 6%. The number of people working was still well below where it was before the pandemic. And so they they said that, well, there's still a lot of slack in the economy, we should we should let this fiscal program do its job and bring the economy back to full employment. What we've learned since then is that because of the pandemic with a lot of people staying home, that the unemployment rate, for example, the number of jobs may not be a really good indicator of whether the labor market is hot or not. And so, they're looking now at things like the number of job vacancies which show that employers are having a terrible time finding enough workers and that the labor market is is distorted. The other issue that they were looking at was the supply chain issue. You know, the pandemic has snarled supply chains around the world that has helped drive up prices. The Fed believed in the middle of 2021 that these factors would likely solve themselves over time that in other words that supply shocks were quote ""transitory"" and so that they didn't need to respond to the early stages of inflation because it was going to go away by itself. That proved wrong. So they were they were a couple of, of issues I think that are related primarily to the pandemic itself and the way that it scrambled the usual indicators that made it harder for the Fed to read the economy.SORKIN: We did get into a question about how he read the economy at that time.BERNANKE: I wasn't particularly on board with the view that the number of jobs was the right indicator of how tight labor market was because I knew first of all that immigration was low. I knew a lot of people were staying home not because they couldn't find a job but because with the pandemic and Delta variants and so on raging, they weren't looking for a job. But I I did believe that some of the inflation was coming from factors created by the pandemic including the supply chain problems through reduction in labor supply. The fact that people were shifting their demand away from services like restaurants towards durable goods like cars, and that was putting up the prices tremendously in those durable goods. So, we've seen big increases in car prices, for example. So I thought, I don't know I didn't have a specific timeframe in mind, but I thought that over this year that those things would begin to reverse. I still think they will reverse eventually but clearly they've been more persistent, more problematic than we, than we, I had thought.SORKIN: And over the years former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has written a lot about inequality. I asked him about the debate over a wealth tax.BERNANKE: I'm not against taxing billionaires, but I think a better way to do it would be to raise capital gains taxes. You could, you could tax realized capital gains. I think an important thing what would be helpful would be to eliminate the provision that when you pass appreciated securities on to your heirs, the appreciation is not taxed at any time. So there are there ways to increase the tax burden on both the income and the wealth of rich people, which I think are much more, just more practical than than a straight wealth tax. And I know defenders of the wealth tax would disagree and there's a great debate about that, but I don't disagree with the objective but I think that you just need to find a method that will not be impossible to enforce.PART IISORKIN: Welcome back to ""Squawk Box."" Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke is out with a new book this week. It's titled, ""21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19."" In an exclusive TV interview, I spoke with Ben Bernanke at his home in Washington, DC and I asked him about what he thinks of the idea that it is hard for the Fed to say it out loud that it's just trying to reduce demand and trying to make things right.BERNANKE: Well, I think Powell can say that now because he has argued that we are beyond full employment. We're not at full employment. We are at a point where work, where employers can't find workers, where there's two jobs available for every unemployed person. And so his argument is that we could cool things down a bit, raise the unemployment rate a little bit, reduce that ratio of vacancies to unemployed persons maybe to one to one let's say without creating a lot of real hardship for workers in America so that you need for long run stability, you need to cool the economy down.SORKIN: We also talked about whether the former Fed chair thinks the Fed is going to become if it hasn't already become politicized politicized.BERNANKE: I think at the moment that the Fed is pretty independent, and certainly nonpartisan.SORKIN: But you do write about efforts that previous administrations have made to politicize—BERNANKE: Yeah.SORKIN: The Fed and the pressures that have been felt.BERNANKE: Absolutely. And I and I think the changes really began to some extent with the first Bush but mostly with Clinton. And since Clinton until Trump, presidents have been pretty, pretty good about letting the Fed do what it thought was necessary.SORKIN: President Biden has said that inflation is his top domestic priority and has talked about higher taxes on the wealthy as a measure of something that he could do. Here's what Bernanke thinks about President Biden or any elected official what they can do about inflation to this point.BERNANKE: It's fairly limited. I mean, I think it's appropriate that the Fed is taking the lead and I think the most important thing that President can do is support the Fed chair and let the Fed chair do what needs to be done even if it's a little bit painful. There's things in this particular case that there's things that probably could help on the margin. I mean the thing that the White House has done to improve supply chains, for example, work to improve public health so we don't have another pandemic and the effects of that, you know, things that make critical goods like health and education cheaper, more efficient, it's not gonna do much for inflation, but it would be good for people who are, you know, feeling like their money is not going far enough.SORKIN: And given the price of oil today, here's what he had to say about the ESG movement, a debate that we've had on this program a lot and some of the new ways that businesses have approached these types of investments.BERNANKE: The fact that people are willing to do ESG investments does suggest that they're interested in, in helping on that side, but I think real real progress is going to take not just private actions, while we should all do what we can to reduce our carbon footprints and so on, but real progress is going to take a collective effort that would involve, you know, other tools.SORKIN: Do you think there's real economic theory behind ESG?BERNANKE: There's always demand for divesting, you know, unpopular stocks, let's say in university endowments and so on and it's fine to show your concern about about the way some country is behaving or the way some company is behaving and so on. But when you divest, you're basically just selling the stock to somebody else who doesn't have quite the same concerns and the effects on the issuer of the stock tend to be fairly modest. So, I'm not saying it has no effect at all, but it's it's a more limited approach than either community level or personal level efforts to reduce say carbon, or even better social wide effort to take strong actions to meet carbon goals.PART IIISORKIN: We also talked out with Bernanke about the chances of a recession. Here's what he had to say.BERNANKE: The more the Fed has to tighten in order to get inflation down, the bigger the chance of a recession and the more severe it will be. How much the Fed has to tighten depends in turn on what happens to these factors they can't control like the supply chains and the commodity prices. So that prediction requires you to make a prediction not only about the Fed's behavior but about a lot of other things the Ukraine war, etc. So it's a very hard thing, very uncertain thing to say. I guess that I still tend to believe that some of these forces pushing up inflation like the supply chains, like the preference for durable goods or services and some of the commodity price increases gas prices and so on, that they will at least stabilize and begin to moderate sometime during this year which would mean that inflation will come down to some extent, not saying by itself, but without the Fed's direct intervention. If that happens, the Fed would have to raise rates perhaps moderately above neutral. When they do that, they'll slow demand. But as Jay Powell has pointed out, the economy is pretty strong. We're not going into recession as often is the case with a troubled economy. In fact, the underlying economy as we recover from the pandemic is quite strong. We have a very strong labor market, for example, we have a strong financial system, we have strong balance sheets. So if if the inflation slows as I expect it ultimately will, although I've been disappointed about how slow that process is, than the Fed should not have to raise rates, you know, too far and what we would get that would be a slowing of the economy, maybe even a stall, but not a severe recession. The severe recession would only come if these other factors simply do not cooperate and in particular, the thing the thing people should watch most closely is inflation expectations. If inflation expectations as measured by breakevens in the Inflation-Protected and Securities market, as measured by surveys and so on, begin to move up in a significant way that people have lost confidence in the credibility of the Fed, the Fed will have to react much more strongly and the effects in the economy will be much more deleterious. AndSORKIN: And how concerned are you about that?BERNANKE: For the moment, knock on wood. This is a big difference between today the 1970s. In the 1970s, inflation expectations were all over the place and nobody had any confidence in the Fed, that it would bring inflation back down. Today, most indicators suggests that people are still pretty confident that the Fed or maybe some combination of the Fed and the end of the pandemic will lead to more normal inflation in the future.SORKIN: And we couldn't have a conversation without talking about Bitcoin. Take a look at this Bitcoin right now down a little under 30,000 and in Bernanke's new book, he writes about the potential of the digital dollar. So of course, I asked him to share his point of view on cryptocurrency these days. This is what he had to say.BERNANKE: So Bitcoin and other currencies, cryptocurrencies whose whose value changes minute to minute, they've been successful as a speculative asset and people you're seeing the downside of that right now. But they were intended to be a substitute for fiat money. And I think in that respect, they have not succeeded because if, if bitcoin were a substitute for fiat money, you could use Bitcoin to go buy your groceries. Nobody buys groceries with Bitcoin because it's too expensive and too inconvenient to do that. We're over the price of groceries, the price of celery varies radically day to day in terms of Bitcoin and so there's no stability either in the value of Bitcoin. The main use of Bitcoin is mostly for underground economy activities and things that often things that are illegal or illicit. So I don't think that Bitcoin is going to take over as an alternative form of money. It'll be around as long as people are believers and they want to speculate in this but again, I don't think it's going to—SORKIN: And you don't, you don't buy into the idea of it as being a store of value or some kind of version of digital gold.BERNANKE: Well, as I said, it's a speculative asset, but it's, it's one that whose underlying use value, gold has underlying use value. You can use it to fill cavities. The underlying use value of a Bitcoin is to do ransomware or something like that. So, one of the other risks that Bitcoin has is that it could at some point be subject to a lot more regulation and the anonymity is also at risk I think at some point. So, you know, investors in Bitcoin should be, should be aware of that."
2022-05-17,"Sales rose 0.9% in April, just below the 1% estimate, according to numbers that are not adjusted for inflation.April's gains were powered by a 4% gain from miscellaneous retail and a 2.1% jump in online sales.A separate report showed that industrial production rose 1.1% in April, well above the 0.5% estimate. Consumers kept spending in April, with retail sales rising about in line with Wall Street expectations despite an ongoing surge in prices.Monthly sales rose 0.9% overall, just below the Dow Jones estimate for a 1% increase, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Excluding autos, sales increased 0.6%, which was better than the 0.4% estimate.The numbers are not adjusted for inflation, so they are indicative both of sustained spending as well as the fastest acceleration in prices the U.S. economy has seen in about 40 years.""Retail sales in April show that the consumer is weathering the inflationary headwinds, rising for the fourth consecutive month,"" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. ""Core categories show signs that consumers are likely dipping into savings to offset the decline in real wages. If pricing pressures can moderate enough to relieve some of the pressure on consumers, we expect a rebound in economic growth in Q2.""In addition to the solid showing in April, March's spending was revised substantially higher, from the original estimate of a 0.5% increase to a 1.4% gain. Ex-autos sales were revised sharply higher as well, to a gain of 2.1% in March against an original 1.1%.On a year-over-year basis, sales were up 8.2% on the headline number, and 10.9% excluding autos.April's gains were powered by a 4% gain from miscellaneous retail and a 2.1% jump in online sales. Bars and restaurants also showed a solid 2% increase. All three categories posted larger gains than in March.The increases came despite a 2.7% decrease at gasoline stations as energy prices declined during the month. Excluding gas stations, sales increased 1.3%. Even with the monthly decline, gasoline sales soared 36.9% from a year ago.Bar and restaurant sales rose 19.8% from a year ago, when the economy was still struggling with Covid-related restrictions.The sales data are largely consistent with an economy that continues to grow despite inflation pressures. Prices overall increased 0.3% in April and 0.6% excluding food and energy. On an annualized basis, the consumer price index rose 8.3% on headline and 6.2% on core in April.Gross domestic product fell 1.4% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, but most economists expect growth to pick up through the year.A separate report Tuesday showed that industrial production rose 1.1% in April, well above the 0.5% Dow Jones estimate, according to Fed data. Capacity utilization, or the level of potential output being realized, increased to 79%, slightly ahead of the 78.6% estimate."
2022-05-17,"China's tight Covid controls have reignited conversations about moving supply chains out of the country.""From China's perspective, the movement out of local manufacturing is not going to be significant enough to really alter the nature of China's role in the overall supply chain,"" Vishrut Rana, Singapore-based economist at S&P Global Ratings, said in a phone interview.For the first four months of the year, foreign direct investment into China rose by 26.1% year-on-year to $74.47 billion, China's Ministry of Commerce said, with that from the U.S. up by more than 50%. BEIJING — China still holds the cards for global supply chains, whether or not Covid lockdowns frustrate businesses in the near term.Companies and analysts have discussed moving factories out of China for years, especially since labor costs have climbed and U.S.-China trade tensions worsened.The pandemic has reignited those conversations. Foreign businesses talk about how executives can easily travel to Southeast Asia factories, but not China. Some point to surging exports from Vietnam as an indicator that supply chains are leaving China.""Supply chain diversification is quite tricky because people always talk about it, and boardrooms love to discuss it, but often at the end of the day people find it's difficult to implement,"" said Nick Marro, global trade leader at The Economist Intelligence Unit.When businesses had those discussions in 2020, it turned out that ""China was able to remain open, while Malaysia, Vietnam were going offline,"" Marro said. ""Really, the critical factor right now is how China plans on maintaining these [Covid] controls as the rest of the world opens up."" China's so-called zero-Covid strategy of swift lockdowns helped the country quickly return to growth in 2020. However, implementation of those measures has since tightened, especially this year as China faces a resurgence of Covid in Shanghai and other parts of the country. By the numbers, China's exports rose by 3.9% in April from a year earlier, the slowest pace since a 0.18% increase in June 2020, according to official data accessed through Wind Information.Vietnam in contrast saw exports jump by 30.4% in April from a year ago, following a nearly 19.1% year-on-year increase in March, Wind showed.The level of manufacturing interest in Vietnam is ""very significant,"" Vishrut Rana, Singapore-based economist at S&P Global Ratings, said in a phone interview. ""Vietnam has emerged as a very key supply chain node for consumer electronics."" But Vietnam's exports totaled $33.26 billion in April, or about one-eighth of China's $273.62 billion in global exports that month, according to Wind.""From China's perspective, the movement out of local manufacturing is not going to be significant enough to really alter the nature of China's role in the overall supply chain,"" Rana said. ""China still remains at the very center of the electronics network in APAC."" For the first four months of the year, foreign direct investment into China rose by 26.1% year-on-year to $74.47 billion, China's Ministry of Commerce said Thursday. During that time, investment from Germany jumped by 80.4%, while that from the U.S. rose by 53.2%.In contrast, Vietnam saw a 56% year-on-year drop in foreign direct investment to $3.7 billion in the first four months of the year, Wind data showed. Foreign direct investment from the U.S. fell by 14%. ""It is very difficult to match the scale and scope of China's supply chains outside China at the moment,"" Rana said. Only supply chains for very specific products — like semiconductors or electric vehicle parts —might be moving to Vietnam, Malaysia or other countries, he added.China's supply chain dominance, built up over the years, is also supporting new business models.One of the better known is Shein. Backed by funds such as Sequoia Capital China, the company has combined big data analytics and its supply chain network in China to become an international e-commerce giant in low-cost fast fashion.""China's supply chain advantage is not just based on labor cost,"" James Liang, managing partner at Skyline Ventures, said in Mandarin translated by CNBC. According to his analysis, at least 20% of the cost of goods sold by apparel and furniture producers goes into labor costs, versus just 5% for electronics producers.China's advantage is the benefit of having supply chain hubs, which in Liang's view pave the way for businesses to boost efficiency by integrating all their suppliers onto one digital system.He said his firm invested $5 million in October into a furniture company called Povison, which is trying to replicate Shein's model for clothing. Additional investment plans have been delayed due to Covid-related travel restrictions, he said. The latest Covid lockdowns have also slowed the ability of trucks to transport goods throughout China, while keeping many factories in the Shanghai region at limited or no production for weeks. That's on top of Beijing's policy since 2020 requiring two- or three-week quarantine upon arrival in China — if the traveler can book one of the few flights in.Shifting operations out of China is difficult, but ""what our survey is indicating is there will be less investment into China and more investment into Southeast Asia,"" Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, said during a webinar. He noted how it is now far easier to fly executives to Singapore or other countries in the region, than to China.As a result of the latest Covid controls, nearly a quarter of 372 respondents to the EU Chamber of Commerce in China's survey in late April said they were considering shifting current or planned investments to other markets.But 77% said they didn't have such plans. A survey of U.S. businesses in China found similar trends.Those survey results indicate that ""companies don't want to quit the market, but they don't know what to do,"" said the EIU's Marro. ""Right now it's more a story of hesitation.""""Foreign companies are going to be upset about these [zero-Covid] policies, but at the end of the day there's not many companies that are going to jeopardize their position in a decades-long market based on a temporary shock,"" he said.

2022-05-17,"The United States government is moving to ease a few economic sanctions on Venezuela.The gesture is meant to encourage resumed negotiations between the U.S.-backed opposition and the government of President Nicolás Maduro.The limited changes will allow Chevron Corp. to negotiate its license with the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, but not to drill or export any petroleum of Venezuelan origin. The United States government is moving to ease a few economic sanctions on Venezuela in a gesture meant to encourage resumed negotiations between the U.S.-backed opposition and the government of President Nicolás Maduro.The limited changes will allow Chevron Corp. to negotiate its license with the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, but not to drill or export any petroleum of Venezuelan origin, two senior U.S. government officials told The Associated Press late Monday. The officials spoke under the condition of anonymity because the formal announcement had not been made.Additionally, Carlos Erik Malpica-Flores — a former high-ranking PDVSA official and nephew of Venezuela's first lady — will be removed from a list of sanctioned individuals, they said.The moves follow goodwill gestures by Maduro after meeting in March with representatives of the administration of President Joe Biden and a recent gathering in Central America between U.S. officials and the main Unitary Platform opposition coalition to discuss a path forward.""These are things that ... the Unitary Platform negotiated and came to us to request that we do in order for them to be able to return to the negotiating table,"" one of the officials said.Scores of Venezuelans, including the country's attorney general and the head of the penitentiary system, and more than 140 entities, among them Venezuela's Central Bank, will remain sanctioned. The Treasury Department will continue to prohibit transactions with the Venezuelan government and PDVSA within U.S. financial markets.Maduro himself is under indictment in the United States, accused of conspiring ""to flood the United States with cocaine"" and use the drug trade as a ""weapon against America.""Venezuela's government suspended talks with the opposition in October after the extradition to the U.S. of a key Maduro ally on money laundering charges. Maduro at the time conditioned his return to the negotiating table on the release from custody of businessman Alex Saab, who was extradited from the African nation of Cape Verde.The negotiations took place in Mexico City under the guidance of Norwegian diplomats. The opposition and the Venezuelan government on Tuesday were expected to announce the resumption of negotiations.California-based Chevron is the last major U.S. oil company to do business in Venezuela, where it first invested in the 1920s. Its four joint ventures with PDVSA produced about 200,000 barrels a day in 2019, but the U.S. government ordered it in 2020 to wind down production, and since then, it has only been allowed to carry out essential work on oil wells to preserve its assets and employment levels in Venezuela.The change allows ""Chevron to negotiate the terms of the potential future activities in Venezuela,"" a senior U.S. official told reporters Tuesday. ""It does not allow entry into any agreement with PDVSA or any other activity involving PDVSA or ... Venezuela's oil sector. So, fundamentally, what they are doing is just allowed to talk.""Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The company's investments in Venezuela's oil fields and machinery over the last century had an estimated value of $2.6 billion as of 2020.Venezuela sits atop the world's largest oil reserves, yet its political upheaval and economic decline have pushed more than 6 million people to migrate in recent years. About three quarters of those who remain live on less than $1.90 a day, considered the international standard for extreme poverty, and many lack access to clean, running water and electricity.The U.S. and other countries withdrew recognition of Maduro after accusing him of rigging his 2018 reelection as president. In his place, they recognized Juan Guaidó, who was head of the then-opposition-dominated congress and remains the leader of the Unitary Platform.For the past five years, the U.S. has used punishing financial and personal sanctions, criminal indictments and support for clandestine groups in an unsuccessful campaign to remove Maduro and restore what it sees as Venezuela's stolen democracy.But in March, U.S. officials traveled to Venezuela's capital, Caracas, to meet with Maduro after Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended the world order and forced Washington to rethink its national security priorities.After the meeting, Maduro freed two American prisoners and promised to resume negotiations with his opponents.The senior U.S. officials said the government will calibrate sanctions based on concrete outcomes at the negotiations and would reimpose them in the event of backsliding in the dialogue process.""What you are seeing here is a very honed approach that is looking at a clear roadmap in Venezuela, where the only path that the regime has toward the alleviation of sanctions from the United States is a negotiation that leads to concrete outcomes,"" one of the officials told reporters.Malpica-Flores was once national treasurer and PDVSA's vice president of finance. He was individually sanctioned in 2017 as the U.S. targeted people associated with Venezuela's rampant government corruption.His aunt, Cilia Flores, is one of the most influential members of Venezuela's government and a constant presence alongside her husband. Two other nephews of hers are imprisoned in the U.S. on drug conspiracy convictions."

2022-05-18,"Further rises in the coming months are expected to be modest, and the market backs the Central Bank of Russia to continue to unwind its emergency interest rate hike.While the headline inflation rate notched its highest since 2002, month-on-month consumer price growth slowed sharply from 7.6% in March to 1.6% in April.As of Tuesday morning in Europe, the ruble was trading at just over 62 to the dollar, having plunged to an all-time low of 150 to the dollar on March 7. Russia believes it has swerved a financial crisis as its currency rallies and economic data improves, but strategists say the numbers mask some ugly truths for Moscow.Although inflation in the country is running hot, there are signs that price rises are slowing and will continue to do so, while the Russian ruble has gone from an all-time low in March to the world's best performing currency this year.related investing newsHere are 3 reasons to buy gold, according to UBSFred Imbert3 hours agoMeanwhile, economic activity indicators are improving and Russia has thus far managed to avoid defaulting on its foreign currency debt, despite Western sanctions freezing large swathes of its reserves.Russian inflation came in at a two-decade high of 17.8% year-on-year in April, up from 16.7% in March, but price rises are beginning to show signs of slowing. Consumer price growth slowed sharply from 7.6% in March to 1.6% in April, and non-food goods prices increased by just 0.5%, versus 11.3% in March.Further rises in the coming months are expected to be modest, and the market backs the Central Bank of Russia to continue to unwind its emergency interest rate hike, possibly with a 200 basis point cut in June.It comes after the CBR implemented an emergency rate hike that took the country's key interest rate from 9.5% to 20% in late February, several days after Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, in a bid to rescue the ruble. The central bank has since been able to move the rate to 14% as the outlook for inflation and the currency improved, and Capital Economics sees further changes ahead.""Today's [inflation] figures will further support the central bank's assessment that the acute phase of Russia's crisis has passed,"" Emerging Markets Economist Liam Peach wrote in a note last week.""It's possible that consumer prices rise by less than 1% m/m in May as a whole and that headline inflation ends up peaking at just below 20% later this year.""Ruble resilienceThe slowing price increases follow a steep appreciation of the ruble, which in turn reduces import prices.As of Tuesday morning in Europe, the ruble was trading at just over 62 to the dollar, having plunged to an all-time low of 150 to the dollar on March 7, following the announcement of a suite of international sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Loading chart... Despite the dollar's broad strength, owing in part to its perceived safe-haven status amid risk aversion in global markets, the greenback is down almost 17% against the Russian currency year-to-date.Strict capital control measures from Russia's central bank — which include ordering companies to convert 80% of their foreign currency revenues into rubles — have helped revive the ailing currency. The Kremlin also initially banned Russian citizens from transferring money abroad, and transfers are now limited to $10,000 per month for individuals until the end of 2022.""The Russian economy continues to recover from the initial shock in late February and early March,"" Goldman's economist Clemens Grafe wrote in a note earlier this month. ""Concerns about financial stability are fading, the RUB has strengthened back to early 2020 levels.""For many analysts, however, Moscow's actions to defend its currency are tantamount to manipulation, in that demand has been created that would not otherwise exist and capital controls have effectively turned the ruble into a ""managed"" currency.Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Switzerland-based Syz Bank, suggested that while the Russian central bank has deployed a range of tools to make the ruble look valuable, very few people outside Russia ""want to buy a single ruble unless they absolutely have to,"" and traders ""no longer see the ruble as a free trade currency.""""If Russia succeeds in finding a solution to the Ukrainian problem with the corollary of withdrawing sanctions and restoring trade relations with the West, the ruble can potentially retain its current value,"" he said.""On the other hand, if the measures are withdrawn without a resolution, the ruble could collapse, resulting in an explosion of domestic inflation and a deep economic recession in Russia.""And Russia has also undertaken another measure to shore up its currency. The CBR resumed gold purchases on the domestic metals market after a two-year absence, in the hope of storing value to protect Russian wealth against inflation in the event of a further shock to foreign exchange liquidity.""Another strong move went relatively unnoticed in the Western media: the Bank of Russia resumed gold purchases at a fixed price of 5,000 rubles per gram between March 28 and June 30,"" Syz Bank's Monchau said. As gold is traded in U.S. dollars, Monchau noted that this enables the CBR to link the ruble to gold and set the floor price for the ruble in dollar terms. Further ruble rises could therefore increase the price of gold, and Russia has been accumulating the precious metal rapidly since its annexation of Crimea in 2014, now boasting the fifth-largest stockpile in the world.Therefore, the move offers further protection for the Russian economy against liquidity constraints resulting from further sanctions, and the deterioration of the country's foreign currency reserves to service dollar-denominated debts. The closely-watched Purchasing Managers' Index economic indicators are also showing some improvement.After plunging from 48.6 in February to 44.1 in March — with a reading below 50 indicating contraction — April's figures rose to 48.2. This was mostly on the back of improved output and shorter suppliers' delivery times, according to Goldman Sachs.""Russian financial conditions have improved mostly on the back of a narrowing CDS (credit default swap) spreads as Russia paid principal and interest on Eurobonds in USD,"" Goldman's Grafe noted.Russia successfully made payments to holders of two dollar-denominated Russian sovereign bonds, maturing in 2022 and 2042 and worth a collective $650 million, before the end of a 30-day grace period on May 4. However, analysts still warn there's a high probability of a Russian default within the next two years.Temporary victoryThe collective improvement in the data has led Russian President Vladimir Putin to claim that the West's ""economic blitzkrieg"" — or ""lightning war"" — had failed.Yet while Russia appears to have fended off impending economic collapse, the longer-term outlook is less optimistic, as the knock-on effects from mitigation measures and the threat of further sanctions remain in play. A survey by the Central Bank of Russia of more than 13,000 businesses recently revealed that many were already running into trouble importing goods into the country.These included car parts, packaging and microchips, and raw material shortages are forcing some companies to suspend factory operations or seek resources elsewhere, the survey found.Meanwhile, Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, told the BBC last week that the ""superficial"" economic indicators would mean little to those on the ground, where job security remains hazy for many Russians.""Within this year, we will see the effect on Russian economy as companies start to run out of parts or equipment and have to start laying people off or putting them on unpaid leave,"" she told Grid News in a separate interview this week."
2022-05-18,"Goldman Sachs analysts have cut their China GDP forecast to 4% from 4.5% after weak data in April.The bank does not expect China will start fully easing Covid controls before the second quarter of 2023.On Monday, Citi — which had one of the highest China GDP forecasts — cut its outlook for growth to 4.2% from 5.1%. BEIJING — Goldman Sachs analysts on Wednesday cut their forecast for China's GDP to 4% after data for April showed a slump in growth as Covid-19 controls restricted business activity.The new forecast is even further below the ""around 5.5%"" growth target the Chinese government announced for the year in March.related investing newsWalmart shares rise slightly on higher full-year guidance. Here's how to play the stockJoshua Natoli7 hours ago""Given the Q2 Covid-related damage to the economy, we now expect China's growth to be 4% this year (vs. 4.5% previously),"" Hui Shan and a team at Goldman wrote in a report Wednesday. That prediction assumes there will be significant government support, on top of measures to stabilize the property market and control Covid outbreaks.Since March, mainland China has struggled to contain its worst Covid outbreak in two years. Notably, the metropolis of Shanghai only started this week to begin discussing the resumption of normal activity — with a goal of mid-June.Among April's weak data, the Goldman analysts pointed to a plunge in housing starts and sales, half the credit growth that markets expected and a drop below 1% for the increase in consumer prices, excluding food and energy.Other data for April released Monday showed an unexpected drop in industrial production and a worse-than-expected 11.1% decline in retail sales from a year ago. Exports, a major driver of growth, rose by 3.9% in April from a year earlier, the slowest pace since a 0.18% increase in June 2020, according to official data accessed through Wind Information. ""The weak data highlight the tension between China's growth target and zero-Covid policy which is at the core of China's growth outlook,"" the Goldman analysts said.They noted how Chinese leaders have emphasized their ""dynamic zero-Covid"" policy, and how news that China will not host the Asian Cup next summer due to Covid reflects Beijing's conservative mindset.""We now expect reopening does not start before 2023Q2 and the process to be more gradual and controlled than previously assumed,"" the Goldman analysts said. ""This is why our 2023 GDP growth forecast only increases by a quarter point to 5.3% (vs. 5.0% previously) despite the half a point downward revision to 2022 full-year growth forecast."" On Monday, Citi — which had one of the highest China GDP forecasts — cut its outlook for growth to 4.2% from 5.1%.A few days earlier, JPMorgan had reduced its estimate to 4.3% from 4.6%.

2022-05-19,The beginning of the true impact of inflation on the economy from Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) shows who has been eating rising costs. It also shows that the Federal Reserve is being short-sighted and ill-advised by not having an intra-day 100-basis-point increase to shock the system. Inflation is everywhere … can there be a demand destruction?
2022-05-19,"Consumers are grappling with record high gas prices, but the surge is also hurting businesses.The national average for a gallon of gas hit a new high Thursday. California's statewide average is now above $6.Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent an already tight energy market reeling. ""We did not anticipate that transportation and freight costs would soar the way they have as fuel prices have risen to all-time highs,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell said Wednesday. The surge in gasoline prices is impossible to miss and at the top of consumers' minds as billboards announce that gas now costs $4, or $5, or even above $6 a gallon in some places.With prices at record highs, Americans are feeling the impact at the pump immediately. But higher fuel prices are a headwind for the wider economy too, beyond just consumers having less spending money. The rising cost of fuel, especially diesel, means that anything transported on a truck, train or ship is affected. Energy costs are a major contributor to the decades-high inflation numbers showing up, as prices for all manner of goods and services march higher.""Energy, in a way, is the tail wagging the dog here,"" Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group, said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""Diesel is really the economic fuel. It's the lifeblood of the economy, transportation, power in some cases ... so it really is embedded in economic activity and it's filtered through so many goods and services."" The surge in gasoline prices is thanks, in large part, to the jump in oil prices. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the latest catalyst to push crude higher, but prices were already on the move ahead of the war.Even before Covid, energy producers cut back on investment and less profitable projects under pressure from low prices and institutional shareholders demanding higher returns.Then producers slashed output further during the throes of the pandemic, when the need for petroleum products fell off a cliff. People weren't going anywhere and businesses were shuttered, so far less fuel was needed. Demand dropped so suddenly that West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, briefly traded in negative territory. Economies have since reopened, manufacturing has revived, and people are driving and flying again. This led to a surge in demand and an increasingly tight oil market beginning last fall. In November, President Joe Biden tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a coordinated effort with other nations, including India and Japan, in an effort to calm prices. But the relief was short-lived.Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the end of February sent an already fragile energy market reeling.U.S. oil shot to the highest level since 2008 on March 7, topping $130 per barrel. Russia is the largest oil and products exporter in the world, and the European Union relies on it for natural gas. While the U.S., Canada and others banned Russian oil imports shortly after the invasion, the European Union said it couldn't do so without detrimental consequences.Now, the bloc is trying to hammer out a sixth round of sanctions against Russia that includes oil, although Hungary is among those pushing back.  Oil has since retreated from its post-invasion highs but remains firmly above $100. To put that number in context, at the beginning of 2022 a barrel of crude fetched $75, while at this time last year prices were closer to $63.The rapid rise in oil and therefore fuel costs is causing a headache for the Biden administration, which has called on producers to pump more. Oil companies are reluctant to drill after pledging capital discipline to shareholders, and executives say that even if they wanted to pump more they simply can't. They're facing the same issues that are playing out across the economy, including labor shortages and rising prices for parts and raw materials, such as sand, which is key to fracking production.Oil prices make up more than half of the ultimate cost for a gallon of gasoline, but it's not the sole factor. Taxes, distribution and refining costs also influence prices. Constrained refining capacity is beginning to play a larger role. Refining is the key step that turns crude oil into the petroleum products consumers and businesses use daily. The amount of oil that refiners can process has fallen since the pandemic, especially in the Northeast.Meanwhile, petroleum product exports from Russia are being hit by sanctions, leaving Europe looking for alternate suppliers. Refiners are running nearly at full capacity, and crack spreads — the difference between refiners' cost of oil and the price at which they sell their products — for diesel are now at record levels. All of these factors are pushing gas prices higher. The national average for a gallon of gas hit a record $4.589 on Thursday, according to AAA, up from $3.043 at this time last year. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation.Every state is now averaging more than $4 per gallon for the first time on record, while California's statewide average is now above $6.Diesel prices are rocketing higher too. Retail diesel prices hit an all-time high of $5.577 a gallon on Wednesday, up 76% over the past year.Households are now shelling out $5,000 per year on gasoline, according to Yardeni Research, up from $2,800 a year ago. Demand destruction, or the level at which high prices influence consumer behavior, from surging fuel costs might not have set in yet on a wide scale, but the impacts are filtering throughout the economy. Higher prices at the pump mean not only less spending money in consumers' pockets but also expanding costs for companies, some or all of which will later be passed along to consumers.Target is one of the companies grappling with higher costs. Shares of the store chain cratered 25% on Wednesday — the single worst day since 1987 — following Target's earnings results, during which it warned about inflationary pressures.""We did not anticipate the rapid shifts we've seen over the last 60 days. We did not anticipate that transportation and freight costs would soar the way they have as fuel prices have risen to all-time highs,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell said Wednesday on the company's quarterly earnings call.He told CNBC that higher fuel and diesel costs will be a roughly $1 billion incremental cost during the fiscal year and a ""significant increase that [Target] didn't anticipate."" Executives from Walmart made similar comments. ""[F]uel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through, creating a timing issue,"" Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said Tuesday during the retailer's first-quarter earnings call. ""Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S. than we forecasted."" McMillon added that over the course of the quarter the company made ""progress matching pricing to the increased costs.""Tractor Supply executives noted that domestic and import freight costs have increased ""substantially"" over the last year and said they expect those trends to persist throughout 2022.""The cost to ship an overseas container has more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic rates, and the cost of fuel is approximately one and a half times higher than it was even a year ago,"" Amazon noted during its quarterly update. Monster Beverage executives said the company experienced ""significant increases in the cost of sales relative to the comparative 2021 first quarter primarily due to increased freight rates and fuel costs.""The airline industry is also feeling the impact, as jet fuel prices — especially on the East Coast — surge. Southwest Airlines noted that it saw a ""significant rise in market jet fuel prices"" over the last quarter, while United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told CNBC that if today's jet fuel prices hold it will cost the airline $10 billion more than in 2019. Bob Biesterfeld, CEO at C.H. Robinson, summed it up. ""The challenge that sits in front of us, however, is really the rising and record cost of diesel fuel, which has such a huge impact on overall freight pricing,"" he said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""To put the surge in context, he said that a carrier will now have to pay close to $1,000 more than last year in fuel costs to move a shipment from Los Angeles to the East Coast.""That's a real pressure on inflationary costs,"" he said. Looking ahead, experts say that demand destruction could be the only thing to quell rising gasoline prices.John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, said a $5 national average is in the cards for the busy driving season between Memorial Day weekend and the Fourth of July. ""It appears [the national average] needs to go higher,"" he said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""Last week we saw gasoline demand shoot up to what is typically summertime-type levels ... there's more upside here.""Kilduff pointed to two key factors spurring demand despite high prices: pent-up demand after the pandemic, and a strong labor market, which means that people will pay what they have to to get to their job. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said he believes the national average will peak at between $4.60 and $4.65.He noted that the sell-off in stocks has dragged gasoline futures lower, which could lead to some temporary reprieve for consumers at the pump.But petroleum is also used in a lot of consumer products, especially plastic, which means even if gas prices temporarily cool, costs across the economy could remain elevated if oil stays high.Rapidan's McNally said at this point it will take a recession to rein in product inflation. ""It's not a happy forecast. But [gas prices] just have to go higher, because there is no sign yet of real demand capitulation ... they will go higher until that happens,"" he said."
2022-05-19,"Participants have to be vaccinated against Covid-19.They also have to get tested both before and after their arrival in town in order to take part in the five-day event.According to the organizers almost 2,500 people are expected attend Davos next week down from the 3,000 participants in January 2020. The rich, famous and most powerful are once again returning to the Alpine retreat of Davos, Switzerland, next week following a two year coronavirus-induced hiatus that had forced the economic shindig online.And this year's edition of the World Economic Forum, taking place in May not January, is looking like a very different prospect.For starters, participants have to be vaccinated against Covid-19. They also have to get tested both before and after their arrival in town in order to take part in the five-day event.According to the organizers almost 2,500 people are expected to attend Davos next week down from the 3,000 participants in January 2020.Participants are considered fully vaccinated if they have received two doses, plus a third booster shot, of all the main vaccines developed to fight Covid, including China's CoronaVac from Sinovac. Russia's Sputnik vaccine is not among the recognized shots.This year's attendee list does not include any Russian government official or company given the Kremlin's decision to invade neighboring Ukraine in February. Russia's onslaught in Ukraine will undoubtedly lead many of the conversations in the Swiss Alps, as business leaders and politicians discuss how to deal with a new world order of security, higher food prices and the inevitable rebuilding of the eastern European country.""Davos needs to be big enough to keep both agendas in focus: a war in Europe but also a global economic crisis,"" Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, president of the Open Society Foundations and a Davos participant, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" Friday.In addition, climate change and the (still ongoing) coronavirus pandemic will make up some of the discussion topics.But there'll be one more striking change to this year's edition of Davos: the weather.The traditional winter timing of Davos means it's usually set against the backdrop of mountains covered in snow and temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.But this year's edition is expected to take place with mainly sunny spells and spring-like temperatures that could be above 20 degrees Celsius.Leave the snow boots at home, and pack your sunscreen."

2022-05-20,"""It's very hard to stop inflation without a recession,"" says Larry Harris, former chief economist of the SEC.While the impact may be felt broadly, every household will experience it to varying degrees.Still, there is advice that is universal. By nearly every measure, the U.S. economy made a stunning recovery after the coronavirus pandemic spurred mass shutdowns and layoffs nationwide.The labor market has added back millions of jobs and wages have gone up substantially, even among lower-paying positions.But soaring inflation and rapidly rising interest rates have most Americans worried that the good times will be short lived.More from Personal Finance:Emergency savings take a hitClimbing interest rates mean good news for annuity buyersIt's a good time for young investors to put money in market""Are we going to have a recession? It's pretty likely,"" said Larry Harris, the Fred V. Keenan Chair in Finance at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business and former chief economist of the SEC.""It's very hard to stop inflation without a recession."" To tame the recent inflationary spike, the Federal Reserve signaled it will continue to raise interest rates.When rates are high, consumers get a better return on the money they stash in a bank account and must shell out more to get a loan, which can trigger them to borrow less.""Rising interest rates choke off spending by increasing the cost of financing,"" Harris said. That leaves less money flowing through the economy and growth begins to slow.Fears that the Fed's aggressive moves could tip the economy into a recession has already caused markets to slide for weeks in a row.The war in Ukraine, which has contributed to rising fuel prices, a labor shortage and another wave of Covid infections are posing additional challenges, Harris said. ""There have been huge things happening in the economy and enormous government spending,"" he said. ""When balances get large, adjustments have to be large.""There will be a day of reckoning, the question is how soon.""  The last recession took place in 2020, which was also the first recession some younger millennials and Gen Zers had ever experienced. But, in fact, recessions are fairly common and prior to Covid, there had been 13 of them since the Great Depression, each marked by a significant decline in economic activity lasting for several months, according to data from the National Bureau of Economic Research.Prepare for budgets to get squeezed, Harris said. For the average consumer, this means ""they eat out less often, they replace things less frequently, they don't travel as much, they hunker down, they buy hamburger instead of steak.""While the impact of a recession will be felt broadly, every household will experience such a pullback to a different degree, depending on their income, savings and financial standing.  Still, there are a few ways to prepare that are universal, Harris said.Streamline your spending. ""If they expect they will be forced to cut back, the sooner they do it, the better off they'll be,"" Harris said. That may mean cutting a few expenses now that you just want and really don't need, such as the subscription services that you signed up for during the pandemic. If you don't use it, lose it.Avoid variable rates. Most credit cards have a variable annual percentage rate, which means there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark, so anyone who carries a balance will see their interest charges jump with each move by the Fed. Homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages or home equity lines of credit, which are pegged to the prime rate, will also be affected.That makes this a particularly good time identify the loans you have outstanding and see if refinancing makes sense. ""If there's an opportunity to refinance into a fixed rate, do it now before rates rise further,"" Harris said.Stash extra cash in I bonds. These inflation-protected assets, backed by the federal government, are nearly risk-free and pay a 9.62% annual rate through October, the highest yield on record.Although there are purchase limits and you can't tap the money for at least one year, you'll score a much better return than a savings account or a one-year certificate of deposit, which pays less than 1.5%.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."
2022-05-20,"With turmoil in the markets, high inflation and impending interest rate hikes that will make borrowing money more expensive, many Americans are wondering if the economy is heading toward a recession.Goldman Sachs chairman Lloyd Blankfein said last weekend that ""it's certainly a very, very high risk factor,"" and consumers should be ""prepared for it."" However, he hedged his comments by saying the Federal Reserve ""has very powerful tools"" and a recession is ""not baked in the cake.""Although it is impossible to know for sure, the odds of a U.S. recession in the next year have been steadily rising, according to a recent Bloomberg survey of 37 economists. They have the probability pegged at 30%, which is double the odds from three months ago.To put that number into context, the threat of a recession is typically about 15% in a given year, due to unexpected events and numerous variables.The bottom line: ""The likelihood of recession this year is pretty low,"" says Gus Faucher, a chief economist at financial services company PNC Financial Services Group. However, ""it gets dicier in 2023 and 2024."" A recession is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months, according to The National Bureau of Economic Research, which officially declares recessions.A key indicator of a possible recession is the real gross domestic product (GDP), an inflation-adjusted value of the goods and services produced in the United States. For the first time since early in the pandemic, it decreased at an annual rate of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022. Since many economists agree that 2% is a healthy annual rate of growth for GDP, a negative quarter to start the year suggests the economy might be shrinking.Another factor is rising inflation, which has recently shown signs of slowing down. But it's still well above the Fed's 2% target benchmark, with a year-over-year rate of 8.3% in April, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index numbers.With a high rate of inflation, higher prices outpace wage growth, making things like gas and rent more expensive for consumers. For that reason, the Fed imposes interest rate hikes, as they did in March and May, with five more expected to follow this year. These hikes discourage spending by making the cost of borrowing money more expensive for businesses and consumers.While many economists still expect the GDP to grow in 2022, the rate by which inflation is decreasing is less clear. However, there are positive economic indicators to consider as well. Job numbers continue to look good, as the U.S. economy in April had its 12th straight month of job gains of 400,000 or more. And employment levels and consumer spending remain strong, for now, despite interest hikes and inflation.""Ultimately, inflation in terms of rising prices needs to work its way into actual spending behavior,"" says Victor Calanog, head of the commercial real estate economics division within Moody's.He points out that consumer expenditures in the U.S. rose by 2.7% last quarter: ""People are still spending more, but at what point will they start spending less?""Despite these positives, risks remain. The Federal Reserve is walking a fine line with its monetary policy, says Faucher, as doing either too much or too little to control inflation could further hurt the economy.""Rising interest rates are designed to cool off growth, hopefully without pushing the economy into recession,"" says Faucher. But he says that if the central bank ""raises their rates too much, that can push the economy into recession.""""That's why I'm more concerned about 2023, or 2024, because we'll have felt the cumulative impact of all of those interest rate increases that we're going to be seeing over the next year and a half.""Correction: Victor Calanog is head of the commercial real estate economics division within Moody's.

The World Economic Forum is trying to fix an image problem.Nearly 2,500 global leaders from business, politics and civil society are expected to take part in a rare springtime version of Davos this week.The annual meeting will see movers and shakers convene in Switzerland's luxury Alpine ski resort of Davos for five days of conversation on issues including Covid-19, Russia's war in Ukraine and the climate crisis.Organizers of the event had postponed the meeting from its traditional January slot over safety concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. However, in a welcome boost to local residents, the forum's first in-person event has now returned after a two-year hiatus.The theme of this year's event is ""History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies.""""It means a lot to us. It means a lot to the whole of Switzerland,"" Samuel Rosenast, a spokesperson for the local tourism board, said in an interview with CNBC's Tom Chitty.Rosenast said the event was ""unbelievably important"" to those residing in Europe's highest town, estimating that the resort could see a windfall of approximately 70 million Swiss francs ($72 million) in just this week alone.""Every business is in contact with the World Economic Forum.

In a clip that has now been viewed nearly 11 million times, Bregman said that a global failure to effectively tackle tax avoidance was the primary cause of inequality.""It feels like I'm at a firefighters conference and no one's allowed to speak about water,"" Bregman said at the time. ""This is not rocket science … we have got to be talking about taxes. That's it. Taxes, taxes, taxes."" The World Economic Forum has also been the subject of unfounded conspiracy theories which it is trying to address head-on. Referencing WEF's previous theme, ""The Great Reset,"" hundreds of thousands of posts have circulated on social media in recent years, many appearing to claim that the global elite were planning to use the coronavirus to bring about total economic collapse.""We, like many other organizations have been the target of misinformation campaigns. And that is something that we're very proactively trying to work towards combating,"" said Saadia Zahidi, managing director at the World Economic Forum.""We believe in facts, we believe in science, we believe in evidence and we believe in expertise. And that's what the hundred or so experts that are gathered at this meeting along with business leaders and political leaders, that's what they are going to provide.""Protestors, activists and people on the frontlines of inequality have sought to challenge the WEF over its ""empty rhetoric,"" accusing Davos of representing ""a symbol of a failed era"" that should be left behind.A report published Monday by global charity Oxfam found that 573 people became new billionaires during the coronavirus pandemic — at a rate of one every 30 hours. The brief, entitled ""Profiting from Pain,"" expects that 263 million additional people will fall into extreme poverty this year at a rate of 1 million people every 33 hours.""Billionaires are arriving in Davos to celebrate an incredible surge in their fortunes. The pandemic and now the steep increases in food and energy prices have, simply put, been a bonanza for them,"" said Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam International.""Meanwhile, decades of progress on extreme poverty are now in reverse and millions of people are facing impossible rises in the cost of simply staying alive.""In his youth, Philipp Wilhelm was one of those protesting the annual gathering of billionaires and political leaders in the town where he was born. Now, however, Wilhelm is the mayor of Davos, and his goal is to deliver a successful meeting.""I protested during the annual meeting because, for me, it was important to express that it's really crucial that we solve this climate crisis. And we need to make the world a more just place,"" Wilhelm said.Wilhelm said that he had taken part in protests because he felt it was essential to ensure that everyone arriving in Davos ""gets the message that it's really important to solve these issues."" Wilhelm said he — and WEF — had changed their positions since his protesting days, adding that he believes he can influence policy more effectively in his current role.When asked whether it was a concern that criticism of WEF had become too closely associated with Davos given that the town itself has become largely interchangeable with the forum, Wilhelm replied: ""No it doesn't bother me at all.""""I think it is interesting that people know Davos as a place where people meet and discuss — and I mean it should be controversial. There should be a discussion about what is the right way to improve the state of the world,"" Wilhelm said. ""The forum's work is ongoing. The meeting is one marker in time,"" the WEF's Zahidi said.""What we've been doing over the last two and a half years — while it hasn't been visible through a particular meeting — is a set of work that is trying to make a dent on inequality and at the same time also make changes towards addressing one of the biggest existential risks we all face which is climate change.""When asked whether rising income inequality had become a particular problem for the forum, Zahidi replied: ""Inequality is a problem for the world. I think we know that societies that do not combat inequality will have slower growth.""""And so there has to be an effort that addresses inequality. Now, what does that? Better education, better skills, better jobs, addressing issues like taxation and changing the nature of our economies so that they actually work for people and not just for the few,"" Zahidi said. ""That is going to be front and center on next week's agenda."""
2022-05-23,"In a blog post ahead of this week's World Economic Forum, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy faces its ""biggest test since the Second World War.""In combining the Russia-Ukraine war, the Covid-19 pandemic and the spike in volatility in financial markets and persistent threat from climate change, the IMF said the world faces a ""potential confluence of calamities."" The International Monetary Fund has warned against ""geoeconomic fragmentation"" as policymakers and business leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.In a blog post ahead of this week's event, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy faces its ""biggest test since the Second World War,"" with Russia's invasion of Ukraine compounding the residual economic effects of Covid-19 crisis, dragging down growth and driving inflation to multi-decade highs.Spiraling food and energy prices are squeezing households around the world, while central banks are tightening monetary policy to rein in inflation, exerting further pressure on indebted nations, companies and families.When combined with the spike in volatility in financial markets and persistent threat from climate change, the IMF said the world faces a ""potential confluence of calamities.""""Yet our ability to respond is hampered by another consequence of the war in Ukraine—the sharply increased risk of geoeconomic fragmentation,"" Georgieva said.""Tensions over trade, technology standards, and security have been growing for many years, undermining growth—and trust in the current global economic system."" She added that uncertainty around trade policies alone cut global GDP by almost 1% in 2019, according to IMF research, and the D.C.-based institution's monitoring also indicates that around 30 countries have restricted trade in food, energy and other key commodities.Georgieva warned that further disintegration would have enormous global costs, harming people across the socio-economic spectrum, and said technological fragmentation alone could lead to losses of 5% of GDP for many countries.Carmine Di Sibio, global chairman and CEO of consultancy giant EY, told CNBC on Monday that the economy has ""taken center stage"" in discussions among big business leaders at Davos.""The economy is the top conversation – inflation is a big concern and you do see some leading indicators starting to slow,"" he said.Although corporate deal volumes have slowed, Di Sibio said EY was still seeing signs of ""pretty robust activity"" and business leaders were still looking at options to transform their businesses, with pricing in the sector coming down of late amid resolute demand. ""The transformation that companies are going through – the transformation in terms of technology, in terms of supply chain and location of supply chain, and de-risking of supply chains – that is still going on and we do a lot around that as well,"" Di Sibio said.SolutionsIn order to address the growing fragmentation, the IMF has firstly called for governments to lower trade barriers to alleviate shortages and reduce the prices of food and other commodities, while diversifying exports to improve economic resilience.""Not only countries but also companies need to diversify imports—to secure supply chains and preserve the tremendous benefits to business of global integration,"" Georgieva said.""While geostrategic considerations will drive some sourcing decisions, this need not lead to disintegration. Business leaders have an important role to play in this regard.""Secondly, the IMF urged collaborative efforts to deal with debt, as roughly 60% of low-income countries currently have significant debt vulnerabilities and will need restructuring.""Without decisive cooperation to ease their burdens, both they and their creditors will be worse off, but a return to debt sustainability will draw new investment and spur inclusive growth,"" Georgieva said.""That is why the Group of Twenty's Common Framework for Debt Treatment must be improved without delay."" Thirdly, the IMF called for a modernization of cross-border payments, with inefficient payment systems posing a barrier to inclusive economic growth. The institution estimates that the 6.3% average cost of an international remittance payment means around $45 billion annually is diverted toward intermediaries and away from lower-income households.""Countries could work together to develop a global public digital platform—a new piece of payment infrastructure with clear rules—so that everyone can send money at minimal cost and maximum speed and safety. It could also connect various forms of money, including central bank digital currencies,"" Georgieva said.Finally, the IMF called for an urgent closing of the ""gap between ambition and policy"" on climate change, arguing for a comprehensive approach to the green transition that combines carbon pricing and renewable energy investment with compensation for those adversely affected by climate change.

2022-05-24,"The Great Resignation — a term coined at the height of the coronavirus pandemic as employees quit their jobs in their swathes — is still in full swing. But as signs of a forthcoming recession mount, you may want to think twice before jumping ship.Four million workers left their jobs in April in the U.S. alone, just shy of the record 4.5 million who resigned in March. And still more plan to join the hoards over the coming months, as they seek out higher salaries, more flexible arrangements and new challenges.Two-in-five Gen Zers and a quarter (24%) of millennials say they will leave their current role by next year, according to a recent Deloitte survey.Yet, the market into which jobseekers are moving is changing rapidly. As inflation soars, central banks are moving quickly to hike interest rates and cool the economy. That, in turn, has increased the likelihood of an economic contraction, with wide-reaching repercussions for workers.""In almost all cases, employees should be a bit hesitant to resign. It's a big decision, and it is often not easy to weigh up all of the pros and cons. A potential economic downturn makes that calculus even more difficult,"" Anthony Klotz, a professor at Texas A&M University who coined the phrase ""The Great Resignation,"" told CNBC Make It. Economists have for months now been warning of the prospect of a recession later in 2022 — a call echoed earlier this month by the U.K.'s National Institute for Economic & Social Research.And while we're not they're yet, career experts say jobseekers should be cautious about moving roles in such an environment as it could leave them more exposed to potential layoffs.""There will be some employers who will follow the rule of 'last in, first out' — meaning that the last employees to be hired will be the first to be let go — should layoffs become necessary,"" Amanda Augustine, career expert for TopResume, said. Layoffs and job cuts are a typical course of action in a recession, as companies seek to downsize and reduce their costs. It is estimated, for instance, that 22 million jobs were lost globally during the 2008-9 global financial crisis.In such circumstances, employers may resort to so-called last in, first out policies, favoring those workers with longer tenure and existing understanding of the business.""I don't foresee a drastic change in philosophy here for reasons that span employer loyalty, to the time it takes to onboard and train talent before seeing full output and productivity,"" Adam Samples, president for staffing at employment firm Atrium, said. Temporary or contract workers could be especially at risk from such termination policies in a downturn, according to Julia Pollak, chief economist at jobs site ZipRecruiter. Though senior, more expensive employees could be at risk, too, she noted.""During layoffs, contractors tend to be most vulnerable,"" Pollak said, highlighting their typical detachment from a business and resultant lack of benefits like severance and health coverage.Workers should therefore carefully weigh the risks and rewards of making a move as the jobs landscape shifts, and whether or not they will be able to justify their value in a new role.""Professionals with hard-to-source skill sets should suffer less in the 'last in, first out' approach, should it come to that in the market,"" said Samples.  Still, for some, the benefits of moving jobs will outweigh the risks, or staying put may simply be untenable.In such cases, experts recommended conducting your job search while still in existing employment, and being strategic about the next role you take on. For instance, if you're looking to move industries, do your research on which sectors historically have been hardest hit by recessions and which have thrived. Hospitality, retail, real estate and travel and tourism, for example, tend to suffer during downturns as consumers cut back on discretionary spending. Meanwhile, essential sectors like health care, utilities, food staples and transportation are typically better able to withstand shocks to the economy.Equally, if you're negotiating with a prospective employer, it may make sense to put greater emphasis on benefits than pay. That doesn't mean undervaluing your contribution; rather it means diversifying your compensation across other perks — like paid time off, flexible working and tuition reimbursement — so you're not both the newest and highest paid employee.""Instead of aiming for the highest-possible salary, focus on negotiating more perks into your offer that will bring you value and improve your overall work-life balance,"" said Augustine.""This way, you're still getting additional value without pricing yourself out of a job, should times fall hard on your new employer.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"
2022-05-24,"A warning sign of recession is when inventory builds exceed what can be absorbed by a weakening consumer.Walmart and Target's big misses last week may signal a shift in consumer spending from goods to services.But when two of the biggest retailers in the world get inventory so wrong, it could be a sign of worse things to come and just how hard it is to fight inflation. Abercrombie & Fitch's weak results didn't help. Retailers are missing and missing big. It started last week with the Walmart and Target results which showed big inventory builds and the need for markdowns, and it's been followed up by weak earnings and outlook from Abercrombie & Fitch which sent its shares tumbling in a similar fashion to what the big box retailers experienced.Is retail the canary in the coal mine for the market? There's good reason to pose the question, though it remains harder right now to answer it in the affirmative. Let's start with the best-case scenario: the consumer is shifting in their spending habits from goods to services, and while the retailers got caught with the tide going out on their pandemic strength, the recent string of results are not the sign of a weakened consumer — it's the preferences that are changing. Remember, no matter how much lower-income Americans struggle with inflation — trading down in grocery store shelves from premium to private-label and steak to ham, a shift that Walmart indicated was happening — two-thirds of consumer spending is done by one-third of Americans in the higher income brackets.The Walmart and Target results could reflect the changing financial realities for mid- to lower-income households in the face of still high inflation, says Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. And conversely, higher-income households are less affected by the inflation headwinds, and even if they feel some negative wealth effect, their balance sheets are still in very good shape.""The level of their wealth and pandemic-fueled savings will continue to buttress their strong consumer spending, especially as they continue to shift towards more in-person services spending,"" she said, and while the rotation of consumer purchases away from goods towards more services hurts retailers like Walmart and Target in sales volumes, it isn't the economy's loss as a whole.This view has been held out as one of the keys to an economic slowdown not turning into a full-on recession, and many economists still hold to it now.""My knee-jerk reaction is recession can be avoided,"" said Scott Hoyt, senior director for Moody's Analytics. ""The high-end consumer is more meaningful.""Best Buy said on Tuesday its outlook has weakened but it isn't planning for a ""full recession.""Home Depot's results last week were the flip side of the consumer equation, with spending on home remodels and from professional contractors boosting results.The stock market drop will weigh on sentiment and high-end consumers have historically been sensitive to it, but this is a unique environment with excess savings, especially among older consumers who were putting away much more cash in recent years as the pandemic created a hole in their spending, Hoyt said. ""That doesn't lessen my concerns about people at the low-end, but from an economics perspective, the high-end is more important, especially if there are still jobs. ... If low-end folks can't afford the ham because they don't have a job, then we have a real problem,"" he added.The retail inventory/sales ratios, even excluding autos, are not flashing warning signals that there is a large unintended build up in inventories that will in the near future start to weigh on economic growth, Bostjancic said. But it is an economic data point that will attract more scrutiny given the recent retail results.""We've been talking for months about the fact that one of the biggest risks to the economic outlook is the inventory swing,"" Hoyt said.Companies are so scared of not having what they need that they are erring on the side of ordering ""a lot"" Hoyt said. They double order to get inventory in the door, and then as demand softens, they can end up with too much inventory and have to cut back and markdown existing inventory.""That's the classic inventory cycle that has historically driven recessions, and not infrequently,"" Hoyt said. ""It's been very clear in our minds for quite some time now.""But this doesn't mean the issues at Walmart and Target are ""enough to say were there and we can't get out of it,"" he added. ""We need to know how pervasive it is.""It is a difficult time for retailers, in particular, because there are reasons why demand for goods should soften without the shift being the economic canary in the coalmine, and goods price inflation has been running higher than service price inflation, and the economy is still a long way from the pandemic shift in spending from services to goods fully reversing. ""Even if you argue it will never fully reverse, it clearly hasn't reversed to near equilibrium level. It's a very tricky environment for retailers in particular,"" Hoyt said.These issues may get worse before they get better into back to school and holiday season, and with lingering pandemic issues in China making companies even more anxious to have inventory. But if inflation keeps running hot and the inventory keeps building into weaker demand, the worst-case scenario could be in the cards. The government's inventory to sales ratio data doesn't suggest a problem yet, in fact, it is still low by pre-pandemic standards. Retail may be an example of an ""isolated sector,"" Hoyt said. But he added, ""it's certainly a cautionary flag. This is a risk we've been aware of for a while and emphasized it's one we need to very closely follow, but I don't know that it says we are going into recession."" He said the trend to watch is not the inventory sales ratio rising — it has been too low — but how fast is rises and how much as it starts crossing pre-pandemic levels. Right now, ""we're not too far off desirable levels,"" he said. None of this can discount the fact that Walmart was off by a lot — caught with 32% more inventory year over year.""It's crazy,"" former Walmart president and CEO Bill Simon told CNBC last week. ""I mean 8% would have been high, 15% would have been terrible, 32% is apocalyptic. I mean that's billions of dollars of inventory. That's just frankly not managed very well.""Target was higher by 43%; Abercrombie & Fitch inventory was up 45% year over year.""I think that they were ordering to try and stay ahead of the supply chain issues and then the product came in and it came in late and they didn't cut the orders in time, I mean there were a lot of things that could have, should have, would have been done that frankly weren't,"" Simon told CNBC.But to Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, the retailers' mistakes should be received by the market as a warning sign of something more fundamental and potentially pervasive.The pivot on spending from goods to services, and the sensitivity of retailers to the lower- and middle-income households who disproportionately feel the price squeeze in things like gas, are real and acute issues. ""People are buying luggage instead of the things they bought before, so all of the things that benefited the retailers, easing the misery of quarantines, is now reversing,"" Swonk said. ""The bulk of inflation is in the service sector, as is the bulk of spending, and it should be slowing down in goods. Goods had seen deflation until the pandemic,"" she said.But while that may help the Fed to get some drop in goods prices, it won't cool the economy enough.In the rapid inventory builds at the big box retailers, Swonk sees an inflationary economy that perpetuates more booms and busts within it, and that shouldn't allay concerns about the macroenvironment. ""The Fed is in a world which is now more boom-bust prone,"" Swonk said. ""It's as if the Fed went through the looking glass and was unable, like Alice, to wake up. It's still in an alternative universe and it's not going back,"" she said.The resilience of the U.S. economy may ultimately up the ante on the Fed to raise rates.""We generated 2.1 million jobs in the first four months of the year. That's a year [of job gains] on average in the 2010s and a lot of new paychecks,"" Swonk said. ""We're not in a recession yet by any means,"" she added, but more corporate chief economists are not talking as if they went through the looking glass as well — taking margin hits based on high costs even as they pass along price increases to consumers.""This is what happens,"" she said.The bullwhip that Walmart and Target experienced didn't come out of nowhere and isn't limited to goods — Amazon overstaffed as the world came out of omicron, a labor factor Walmart also pointed to in its recent earnings disappointment.""These are clearly important retailers and it matters,"" Swonk said.Firms will still be in a ""we don't know if we can get goods now"" mindset, with ""Zero Covid"" lockdowns still an issue in China, and that will hit smaller and medium-sized firms even harder than it hits the retail giants, who will be doing their own discounting. Major retail behemoths can absorb the shock better on margins, but getting hit with both high inventories and costs, still adds up to one thing for them: ""Taking it on the chin,"" Swonk said.The supply chain's vulnerabilities are not going away and building in a cushion is costly. ""It's been a long time since we had anything like this,"" Swonk said.What the market knows for sure from the recent string of retail disappointments is that the pivot from goods to services is underway, and inflation hurts the low-income households first, and that begins to squeeze business margins. But where does that squeeze end?That is the question Swonk says that a market already on edge will have to answer.The optimistic narrative has been that the economy can hit this soft landing with the Fed's ""blunt"" tools and slow demand in a supply-constrained world without bumps in the road.""That narrative disappeared,"" Swonk said. ""The bumps are already there, and even if parts of the economy benefit.""Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman outlined two options for the economy to fight inflation in a series of tweets on Tuesday: ""There is no prospect for a material reduction in inflation unless the Fed aggressively raises rates, or the stock market crashes, catalyzing an economic collapse and demand destruction,"" Ackman said.Resorts are booked up for the summer and airlines are back after nearly going under, and the shift into services is a major shift, but also a reality check for the economy.Stock market investors don't care about the margin pressures faced by independent restaurant owners, but when it is showing up in the country's biggest retailers, investors start to worry about where else they will see the margin pressure. ""It's whack-a-mole,"" Swonk said. ""And you will see it elsewhere.""Inflation is now as big an issue for companies as it is for households, and the situation can change on a dime. ""It changed to their favor for a while, but the reality is inflation burns everyone,"" she said.When the large firms that are known for low costs, and known for management of inventory and costs, are feeling the heat of inflation, it's a wake up call, not an isolated event."

Liberal billionaire George Soros on Tuesday warned of a global depression, and said Russia's invasion of Ukraine could be looked back on as the starting point of World War III.At his annual dinner amid the World Economic Forum, Soros said the course of history had changed dramatically since the last Davos, Switzerland, event.""Russia invaded Ukraine. This has shaken Europe to its core,"" he told the audience.""The European Union was established to prevent such a thing from happening. Even when the fighting stops, as it eventually must, the situation will never revert to the status quo ante. Indeed, the Russian invasion may turn out to be the beginning of World War III, and our civilization may not survive it.""Soros said that other issues that concern humanity, such as pandemics, climate change and avoiding nuclear war, have had to take a back seat. ""That's why I say our civilization may not survive,"" he later added.Soros, born in Hungary to a Jewish family that survived the Nazi occupation, emigrated to Britain and later the United States. The financier funds liberal charities and nongovernmental organizations worldwide through his Open Society Foundations, and famously bet against the British pound back in 1992.Speaking Tuesday, Soros said the fight against climate change has had to take second place amid the Ukraine war.""Yet the experts tell us that we have already fallen far behind, and climate change is on the verge of becoming irreversible. That could be the end of our civilization,"" he said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is widely seen as putting a planned energy transition at a crossroads. Gas and oil prices have surged and world energy markets have been severely destabilized. Coal use has increased as Western nations desperately seek alternatives to Russian hydrocarbons.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said the Kremlin's assault on Ukraine will likely have major implications for global heating targets. Guterres described this short-sighted rush to fossil fuels as ""madness,"" before warning that humanity's ""addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.""Soros said he found the prospect of irreversible climate change ""particularly frightening."" ""Most of us accept the idea that we must eventually die, but we take it for granted that our civilization will survive,"" he said.""Therefore, we must mobilize all our resources to bring the war to an early end. The best and perhaps only way to preserve our civilization is to defeat [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. That's the bottom line,"" he added. Soros also took aim at Beijing, which is experiencing its worst Covid-19 outbreak since early 2020. Earlier in May, Chinese President Xi Jinping headed a meeting of top leaders that emphasized the country should stick to its ""dynamic zero-Covid"" policy, and warned that economic consequences would follow if it doesn't.The officials called on the country to unify behind the decisions of the Chinese Communist Party's central committee, and ""resolutely fight"" against all questioning of virus control policies, state media said.""The continuing lockdowns have had disastrous consequences, pushing the Chinese economy into a free fall since March,"" Soros said in his speech Tuesday.Citing a Caixin composite purchasing managers' index, Soros said that China's ""steeply declining economic activity"" is bound to have global consequences.""These negative results will continue to gather momentum until Xi reverses course. ...

""To fulfill the elevated demand for goods and services, businesses increase both investment and hiring, although supply disruptions hinder that growth in 2022.""Here's what the CBO sees for the U.S. economy at the end of each year:Real GDP: 3.1% in 2022, 2.2% in 2023, and 1.5% in 2024.Inflation (measured by CPI): 4.7% in 2022, 2.7% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024.Unemployment rate: 3.7% in 2022, 3.6% in 2023 and 3.8% in 2024.Federal funds rate: 1.9% in 2022, and 2.6% in 2023.The upbeat tone of the report appeared to include an implicit prediction that the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank in charge of managing inflation, will be able to raise interest rates throughout 2022 and 2023 without tipping the U.S. economy into a recession.While the CBO projects inflation will stay well above the Fed's 2% target throughout 2022 and 2023, it also said it's likely that the pace of price increases won't rise above current levels.Growth in the core PCE price index, the metric the central bank prefers to use to measure inflation, rose from 1.4% in 2020 to 4.6% in 2021. The CBO estimates that the figure should recede to a 3.8% pace in 2022 due to the persistent effect of higher home and rent costs.The CBO believes that the Fed, to counteract inflation, will hike its benchmark overnight interest rate to 1.9% by the end of 2022, well below the market's expectation for a figure north of 2.5%.

2022-05-25,"Up until Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department had granted a key exemption to sanctions on Russia's central bank that allowed it to process payments to bondholders in dollars through U.S. and international banks, on a case-by-case basis.However, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control has allowed the exemption to expire as of 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, it was announced in a bulletin Tuesday.Adam Solowsky, partner in the financial industry group at global law firm Reed Smith, told CNBC on Friday that Moscow will likely argue that it is not in default since payment was made impossible, despite it having the funds available. The U.S. has announced that it will not extend an exemption permitting Moscow to pay foreign debt to American investors in U.S. dollars, potentially forcing Russia into default.Up until Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department had granted a key exemption to sanctions on Russia's central bank that allowed it to process payments to bondholders in dollars through U.S. and international banks, on a case-by-case basis.This had enabled Russia to meet its previous debt payment deadlines, though forced it to tap into its accumulated foreign currency reserves in order to make payments.However, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control allowed the exemption to expire early Wednesday morning.Russia has built up substantial foreign currency reserves in recent years and has the funds to pay, so will likely contest any declaration of default on the grounds that it attempted payment but was blocked by the tightened sanctions regime. Moscow has a deluge of debt service deadlines coming up this year, the first being on Friday, when 100 million euros ($107 million) in interest is due on two bonds, one of which requires dollar, euro, pound or Swiss franc payment while the other can be serviced in rubles.Reuters and The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the Russian Finance Ministry had already transferred funds in order to make these payments, but a further $400 million in interest is due late in June.In the event of a missed payment, Russia will face a 30-day grace period before likely being declared in default.Russia has not defaulted on its foreign currency debt since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.'Unknown territory'Central to the fallout from the OFAC's decision not to extend the waiver is the question of whether Russia will consider itself to be in default.Adam Solowsky, partner in the financial industry group at global law firm Reed Smith, told CNBC on Friday that Moscow will likely argue that it is not in default since payment was made impossible, despite it having the funds available.""We've seen this argument before where OFAC sanctions have prevented payments from going through, the sovereign issuer has claimed that they are not in default because they tried to make the payment and were blocked,"" said Solowsky, who specializes in representing trustees on sovereign bond defaults and restructuring.""They are potentially looking at a scenario of prolonged litigation after the situation has resolved as they try to determine if there was in fact a default."" Solowsky highlighted that Russia's situation is unlike the usual process for sovereign default, in which as a country nears default, it restructures its bonds with international investors.""That's not going to be feasible for Russia at this time because basically under the sanctions, nobody can do any business with them, so the normal scenario that we would see play out is not what we would expect in this case,"" Solowsky said.He added that this will affect Russia's access to global markets and potentially drive up asset seizures both domestically and overseas.""We're getting into some unknown territory. This is a major world economy. I think we'll be seeing the fallout effect from the next few days for many years,"" Solowsky said.Default 'for years to come'Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said in an email Tuesday that it is only a matter of time now before Moscow defaults.""The right move by OFAC as this move will keep Russia in default for years to come, as long as Putin remains president and/or leaves Ukraine. Russia will only be able to come out of default when OFAC allows it to. OFAC hence retains leverage,"" Ash said.""This will be humiliating for Putin who made a big thing with [Former Chancellor of Germany] Schroeder at the time Russia was last on the brink of a Paris Club default that great powers like Russia pay its debts. Russia can no longer pay its debts because of its invasion of Ukraine."" Ash predicted that Russia will lose most of its market access, even to China, in light of the default, since Moscow's only financing will come at ""exorbitant"" rates of interest.""It means no capital, no investment and no growth. Lower living standards, capital and brain drain. Russians will be poorer for a long time to come because of Putin.""Ash suggested that this would further Russia's isolation from the global economy and reduce its superpower status to a similar level to North Korea.'Burning bridges'Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC on Friday that since Russia's sovereign debt is low and was falling before the invasion, entering what the EIU sees as an inevitable default may not pose a huge problem for Russia.""To me, it's really a signal as to whether Russia thinks that all bridges have been burned with the West and financial investors. Normally if you're a sovereign country, you do your utmost to avoid a default,"" Demarais said.""All the moves that we are seeing at the moment – at least to me – suggest that Russia isn't really concerned about a default, and I think that is because Russia really expects that there isn't going to be any improvement on the front of relationships with Western countries any time soon."" She added that the punitive sanctions against Russia from the U.S. and Western allies will likely remain in place ""indefinitely,"" since the Kremlin's false characterization of the invasion as being a ""denazifying"" effort means it cannot easily U-turn.The EIU anticipates a hot war throughout the year and protracted conflict thereafter, as Russia and the West attempt to reconfigure supply chains to adapt to the new sanctions regime rather than seeking ways to end it.Russia is still attracting substantial amounts of cash from energy exports, and is attempting to force European importers to pay for oil and gas in rubles in order to swerve sanctions.""What this really shows is this burning bridges strategy of Putin feels he has nothing to lose anymore,"" Demarais added."
2022-05-25,"Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money"" and Investing Club, often says ""there's always a bull market somewhere"" — a reminder that good investing opportunities always exist in the stock market, even when it's down.This is true even in a recession, Cramer says, which is an extended downturn in economic activity that can last months or more. It's not yet clear if the U.S. economy will fall into a recession, but it sure feels like it for people who have recently lost money in the stock market.The S&P 500 has lost nearly 18% of its value since it peaked in January, as uncertainty in Ukraine, high inflation and looming interest rate hikes continue to create turmoil in the stock market.""Lots of people are worried; they think we're headed toward recession. I totally get that,"" Cramer tells CNBC Make It. ""People then say, recession: I better go to cash. No — wrong.""While there's always a risk that stocks will lose value, they also tend to perform very well over time. The average annualized return of the S&P 500 since 1926 has been 10.49%. If you put that cash in a high-yield savings account, you'd only be gaining 0.5% on those funds every year, based on the current interest rates.Instead of dumping your stock during a recession, Cramer suggests changing your mix of stocks.""What you need to say to yourself is, 'What companies have historically done well in a recession?'"" says Cramer, adding that economic activity doesn't stop when the economy shrinks. ""When you go down the supermarket aisles, what are you buying no matter what? Do you brush your teeth in a recession? Yes. Do you wash your hair in a recession? Absolutely,"" says Cramer. ""We're talking about things called staples. And staples are things that you need regardless of the economy.""He advises sticking with stocks of companies in sectors that can weather a recession. Cramer has mentioned a few examples on his show, including banks, food and drug companies.""Procter & Gamble, which just increased its dividend for — I don't know — 60 years, does great in a recession. Coca-Cola, did you know [its] sales don't go down in a recession?"" says Cramer.And, ""beer goes up in a recession, so there's Constellation Brands,"" he adds, referring to the company that produces Modelo and Corona.  Of course, it's important to remember that past performance does not necessarily predict future results. There's always some risk involved when investing in stocks.What you invest in is one thing. How much and whether you want to put more money into the market during a downturn is something else to consider, says Cramer. Since 1978, his investing philosophy for his 401(k) and IRA has been to make contributions every month, but he's also held off on making those payments when the stock market has looked bad.That said, he will make catch-up payments if the market improves, to ensure that he's made 12 months worth of contributions before the end of the year. The bottom line is that you should only invest what you're comfortable investing.""A recession should not dissuade you from investing, but it might dissuade you from investing as much money as you would during an expansion,"" Cramer says.

2022-05-26,"South Korea's central bank hiked interest rates for a second consecutive meeting on Thursday to wrestle consumer inflation down from 13-year highs, and further raised its projections for prices to rise to their highest since 2008. In his first rate review after taking office in April, governor Rhee Chang-yong and his monetary policy board voted to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75%, the highest since mid-2019.Back-to-back interest rate rises by the Bank of Korea follow more than 100 cumulative basis points of hikes since August 2021 in one of the most forceful tightening campaigns ever by the bank.  South Korea's central bank hiked interest rates for a second consecutive meeting on Thursday to wrestle consumer inflation down from 13-year highs, and further raised its projections for prices to rise to their highest since 2008. In his first rate review after taking office in April, governor Rhee Chang-yong and his monetary policy board voted to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75%, the highest since mid-2019. All but one of the 28 analysts polled by Reuters expected a hike.Back-to-back interest rate rises by the Bank of Korea follow more than 100 cumulative basis points of hikes since August 2021 in one of the most forceful tightening campaigns ever by the bank. The BOK raised its inflation outlook for this year to 4.5% from 3.1% before. Consumer inflation at a 13-year high threatens to become entrenched, as a key measure of inflation expectations among South Koreans rose in May to its highest in nearly a decade. Most analysts expect the BOK to take rates up to 2.25% by year end, after which many say it will then need to consider how quickly to apply the brakes amid slowing economic growth in China, its largest trading partner, and high household debt. The U.S. Federal Reserve is forecast to take the key interest rate to 2.50-2.75% by year end, the effects of which will be closely watched globally, while in China authorities are seen easing policy to cushion a slowdown in the world's second largest economy. ""Inflation concerns have become more pronounced, with headline CPI growth hitting record levels and unemployment still at a record-low level,"" said Oh Suk-tae, an analyst at Societe Generale, who sees the base rate peaking at 2.50% by the end of this year.  ""It would be difficult for policymakers to extend the rate-hike cycle into 2023, as we expect the peak-out of inflation in the second quarter of this year.""Governor Rhee last week said the bank could consider big-step interest rate raises in coming months such as 50 basis point hikes, depending on data that will become available around July and August. The BOK expects the economy to expand 2.7% this year, down from its earlier forecast of 3.0% and slowing from an estimated 4.0% for 2021."
2022-05-26,"While some foresaw regional pockets of recession in countries or continents particularly exposed to the Russia-Ukraine war and global supply chain problems – with Europe a particular concern – others painted a bleaker global picture.Inflation has soared worldwide, with food and energy costs skyrocketing as the war and supply chain bottlenecks bite, along with the residual effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The world's financial elite gathered in Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum this week, and a darkening global economic outlook was the number one talking point.While some foresaw regional pockets of recession in countries or continents particularly exposed to the Russia-Ukraine war and global supply chain problems — with Europe a particular concern — others painted a far bleaker global picture.Inflation has soared worldwide, with food and energy costs skyrocketing as the war and supply chain bottlenecks bite, along with the residual effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. This has forced central banks to start tightening monetary policy against a backdrop of slowing economic activity.Recent data indicates that price increases have begun to spill into the underlying economy, posing further risks to global growth and causing headaches for central bank policymakers, who face the unenviable task of tightening monetary policy to rein in inflation without pushing economies into recession.Liberal billionaire financier George Soros, in his speech on Tuesday, took aim at Chinese President Xi Jinping's doubling down on his ""zero-Covid"" policy and associated lockdowns, which he said have pushed the Chinese economy into a ""freefall"" since March. Citing a recent nosedive in the Caixin composite purchasing managers' index, Soros said China's ""steeply declining economic activity"" would feed into a global slowdown unless Xi reverses course.""Coming on top of the real estate crisis, the damage will be so great that it will affect the global economy. With the disruption of supply chains, global inflation is liable to turn into global depression,"" he said.Russia, recession and ratesSpeaking on a CNBC-chaired panel on Monday, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said the prominence of each of the ""three R words"" – Russia, recession and rates – depended on geography.""So in the States, it's much more about rates because there is more resiliency in the economy, in the labor market, in the consumer. The consumer is sitting there on $3.4 trillion of deposits. Coming into Covid, they were sitting on $1 trillion, so there's some buffer there, to be seen if it's used wisely or not – the jury will be out on that,"" she said.""I think much more concerning for Europe, that is right in the middle of the storms from supply chains, from energy crisis, and just the proximity to some of the atrocities that are occurring in Ukraine."" Asked whether Europe will see a recession, Fraser definitively answered: ""Yes – and I hope I'm wrong.""She argued that in Asia, countries were largely emerging from the Covid-19 with ""more sense of optimism."" She suggested that ""even China is seeing this as an event that is occurring rather than a long-term trend,"" and that further packages to stimulate the economy could be expected from Beijing.""Food is the big worry here, because that could be the wildcard. When people are hungry around the world – and there's going to be 1.5 billion hungry people without necessarily the means or the access to food, particularly in Africa but not only – that is a problem.""Food price fearsThe surge in food prices was also raised as a central threat by International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, who said during a panel on Monday that the economic horizon has ""darkened"" due to the combination of the Russia-Ukraine war, tightening financial conditions, dollar appreciation and the slowdown in China.""We have a commodity price shock in many countries, and the particular shock I want to bring your attention to is food price shock. Over the last week, because of that sense that maybe the economy is getting into tougher waters, the oil price went down but food price continues to go up, up, up, up,"" Georgieva said.""Why? We can shrink the use of petrol when growth slows down but we have to eat every day, and the anxiety about access to food at a reasonable price globally is hitting the roof."" In a blog post earlier in the week, Georgieva warned that the global economy faces a ""confluence of calamities"" and its ""biggest test since the Second World War,"" and the IMF estimates that global growth will slow to 3.6% in 2022 from 6.1% in 2021.However, Georgieva was wary of sounding the global alarm, noting that ""there is a long way from 3.6(%) to a global recession.""""What we may see is recession in some countries that are weak to begin with — they haven't recovered from the Covid-induced crisis, they're highly dependent on imports from Russia of energy or imports of food, and they have a somewhat weaker environment already — but we have not seen that yet.""European perilEurope's proximity to the war in Ukraine and excessive reliance on Russian energy imports, along with soaring food and energy prices and global supply shocks from Chinese lockdowns, have led economists to downgrade euro zone growth forecasts substantially over the past month.Euro zone inflation hit a sixth consecutive record high in April, with the 19-member region notching an annual 7.5% rise in consumer prices and piling pressure on the European Central Bank to begin hiking interest rates. ECB leaders this week nodded toward rate rises at the July meeting.""We clearly see the consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's sending shockwaves around the world and the world economic growth forecast has been revised down considerably,"" European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis told CNBC.

However, CEOs at top European companies struck a more pessimistic tone. AXA CEO Thomas Buberl told CNBC that the risk of recession in Europe is ""much higher"" than in the U.S. and that the economic climate for the bloc will only get more difficult from here.Covestro CEO Markus Steilemann said the inflationary environment and declining consumer confidence, at a time when people would ordinarily want to return to traveling and spend in the service industry, meant there is a ""high likelihood"" of a recession in Europe."
2022-05-26,"""The difficulties, in some areas and to a certain degree, are even greater than the severe shock of the pandemic in 2020,"" Premier Li Keqiang said during a nationwide videoconference Wednesday, according to a CNBC translation of a Chinese-language state media report.A state media news broadcast Wednesday showed large conference rooms of people from different provinces tuning into the meeting.There hasn't been such a meeting of this scale for years, and it's unprecedented for one meeting to address so many levels of government at once, said Zong Liang, chief researcher at the Bank of China.  BEIJING — China held a rare nationwide meeting via teleconference Wednesday to bolster an economy battered by Covid.The timing and scale indicated to analysts the level of urgency and current challenges for the country to achieve its target of around 5.5% GDP growth for the year.""The difficulties, in some areas and to a certain degree, are even greater than the severe shock of the pandemic in 2020,"" Premier Li Keqiang said during the videoconference, according to a CNBC translation of a Chinese-language state media report.He warned how the economy is at a ""critical point"" for determining its full-year trajectory, and called on officials to ""work hard"" — for growth in the second quarter and a drop in unemployment, the report said.Mainland China has tried to contain its worst Covid outbreak since early 2020 by using stringent stay-home orders and travel restrictions, most notably in the metropolis of Shanghai. Foreign companies have reported lost production and sales as a result.Although state media did not specify how many people joined the teleconference, an evening news broadcast Wednesday showed large conference rooms of people from different provinces tuning into the meeting. There hasn't been such a meeting of this scale for years, and it's unprecedented for one meeting to address so many levels of government at once, said Zong Liang, chief researcher at the Bank of China. Such direct communication would likely improve implementation of policies to support the economy and control Covid, Zong said. He noted how policy is typically transmitted through several layers of government, and some locales have taken unnecessarily harsh measures.For a sense of the country's scale, China has 31 province-level regions, and more than 2,800 county-level ones. The information office for China's State Council, the top executive body that Li heads, did not respond to a CNBC request for comment about Chinese financial media reports detailing the level of local governments attending.""Chinese policymakers are in greater urgency to support the economy after the very weak activity growth in April, anemic recovery month-to-date in May, and continued increases in unemployment rates,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report Wednesday.They described the teleconference as one with ""provincial, city-level and county-level local government officials across the country."" Li's calls for achieving growth in the second quarter ""may also be implicit acknowledgment that the 'around 5.5%' growth target set in early March this year is very challenging,"" the analysts said.The State Council is sending teams to 12 province-level regions Thursday to inspect policy implementation, state media said.  While the number of new Covid cases has declined in Shanghai, Beijing and other parts of China, analysts have noted how local authorities have been more cautious about relaxing Covid controls. Two more investment banks cut their forecast for China's GDP this week, one as low as 3%. Jianwei Xu, senior economist, greater China, Natixis, said it remains to be seen how effective the announced economic support measures will be. ""The key question is how to revive mobility in the economy,"" Xu said during a webinar Thursday. ""To lift the economy back to the pre-pandemic level probably needs more measures than announced yesterday because [of low] economic confidence.""

2022-05-27,"Japan's core consumer prices may be approaching the central bank's 2% target, but veteran entrepreneur Ernie Higa says it's not time to cheer yet.The core consumer price index in Tokyo, which excludes fresh food and energy, rose 1.9% in May compared to the previous year, government data showed Friday.Japan is currently facing cost-push inflation where prices are going up while wages are not following, leaving retailers in a ""difficult situation,"" Higa told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Friday. Japan's core consumer prices may be approaching the central bank's 2% target, but veteran entrepreneur Ernie Higa says it's not time to cheer yet.""When you talk about inflation, it's kind of like cholesterol – there's good cholesterol and bad cholesterol – what we're experiencing now in Japan is bad inflation,"" Higa, chairman & CEO at Higa Industries, who is known for bringing the Domino's Pizza franchise to Japan, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Friday.The core consumer price index in Tokyo, which excludes fresh food and energy, rose 1.9% in May compared to the previous year, government data showed Friday.While that figure is just shy of the Bank of Japan's ever elusive inflation target, the rise in costs has been largely due to food and energy prices. Excluding fresh food and energy prices, the consumer price index in Tokyo rose just 0.9% year-on-year in May.When the Bank of Japan announced its 2% inflation target, it was looking at demand-pull inflation where the rise in wages would create a ""virtuous cycle"" of consumer spending that further pushes prices and salaries up, Higa explained. But right now, the country is facing a cost-push inflation — where prices are going up while wages are not following, he added. ""As a retailer you're really squeezed because all of your costs have gone up but you're not able to really pass on that cost … to the consumer.""To be clear, Japan is not the only major economy facing price pressures. Other countries like the U.S. and UK are currently facing arguably more severe cost of living problems.The difference, however, is that the Bank of Japan continues to adopt an ultra-dovish monetary policy stance — keeping interest rates relatively low, at a time when peers at the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England have been hiking rates to fight inflation. The divergence in policy outlook has contributed to a sharp weakening in the Japanese yen so far this year, with the currency at one point weakening past the 130 handle against the greenback.The yen has since strengthened from those levels, last trading at close to 127 per dollar as of Friday afternoon in Asia. But that's still a stark contrast to levels around 114 seen against the greenback earlier this year.""The yen exchange is very important because Japan imports 60% of its food, not to mention 99% of its energy, and so this is causing a huge issue,"" Higa said. The Japanese currency's sharp weakening against the dollar is resulting in an ""extreme cost,"" he added.""If you import food, you can't even fix your cost, much less then how do you figure out … your selling price,"" he said."
2022-05-27,"Economic data has shown during this inflationary period that while nominal wages are higher American workers are not experiencing real wage gains.A new CNBC|Momentive national survey of workers shows that two-thirds say their pay isn't keeping up with higher prices. Middle-income Americans are now the most squeezed, according to the survey, and the percentage of workers thinking about quitting is at a four-year high.  The latest inflation read from the government, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, showed on Friday morning that prices may be starting to ease from record levels, but financial stress among workers amid the steepest inflation in four decades remains as high as ever.Two-thirds of American workers say their salaries are not keeping pace with inflation, and the percentage of employees considering quitting a job is at a four-year high, according to a new CNBC|Momentive Workforce Survey. Sixty-six percent of workers say inflation has outpaced any salary gains they've made in the past 12 months, while 19% say increases in their salary have about matched inflation and 13% say their salary has increased more than inflation. As more American workers at multiple income levels give voice to a frustration that the economic data has been signaling throughout this year — that price gains continue to outpace wage gains — the squeeze is particularly high among middle-income workers. Those with incomes between $50,000 to $150,000 are more likely than high-income and low-income groups to say their salary has not kept up with inflation,  according to the survey.The online poll was conducted May 10-16, 2022 among a national sample of 9,254 workers in the United States.While 72% of workers in the CNBC|Momentive poll say they are ""well paid"" or ""very well paid,"" that is tied for the lowest level in the survey's history, while the 28% who say they are not well paid is at an all-time high.Thirty-nine percent of workers say they have seriously considered quitting their jobs in the past three months, the highest level since the survey began in 2019, and up 6% from last November. ""Inflation is absolutely a driver in worker turnover right now,"" said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at Momentive. ""Workers who say their salary has outpaced inflation are the least likely to say they've considered quitting their job in the last three months, and workers who say inflation has outpaced their salary increases are the most likely to be looking for a new job.""The latest inflation reading spurred hopes peak inflation may have been passed, but an easing in prices doesn't mean high inflation is going away.Real wage growth across the wage distribution is down, and it is the middle-income workers that are in a worse position than they were pre-pandemic — the lowest-wage workers, by contrast, while struggling with inflation have seen the biggest wage gains. ""They are getting hit really hard by this,"" said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, which focuses on the needs of low- and middle-income Americans.As companies including Microsoft and Apple announce pay raises for workers this month, among both the salaried class, and in Apple's case, workers in its retail stores where the first unionization drives are underway, Shierholz said workers are aware of one important data point that frustrates them and is pressing them to demand more: corporate profit increases.""We know a huge part of the rise in prices has been because employers' profits have gone way up,"" she said. ""Workers are paying the higher prices and their employers are raking in the profits, and that's just a fundamental imbalance. There is capacity to go higher. There is a choice. These gains are going to profits and employers could make a different choice,"" she said.Quit rates are elevated across the wage distribution, but record level of workers thinking about quitting doesn't directly overlap with the middle-wage worker squeeze, because the highest level of quits is among the lower-wage jobs where the highest level of openings exist.""Low-wage workers are able to job hop, finding new opportunities at higher wage levels. Really high-income workers, those making $150,000 or more per year, are more likely to be in jobs that have been able to boost salaries by the most, so even if they've stayed in their role they've seen their salaries grow,"" Wronski said.  The quit rates in the Covid economy show the biggest spikes in low-wage sectors including retail and food services, not knowledge worker jobs more concentrated in the middle-income bracket.""People were expecting a lot more workers to jump ship when the big raises didn't come, and they didn't,"" said Rucha Vankudre, senior economist at labor market research firm Emsi Burning Glass. Now may be the time to press for more from employers because the level of wage gains and job openings in the current market aren't sustainable. Quit rates will go down and the intense competition for workers the labor economy is witnessing will soften as overall employment continues to rise.""As we get closer and closer to full employment, the job growth will slow and the job openings will slow,"" Shierholz said. And as Covid moves farther into the rearview mirror, more workers will come back.""That's not good for workers,"" she said. ""We are in this extraordinary moment of increased worker bargaining power because of some extraordinary circumstances of the Covid recovery. Those won't last."" An economy that is adding 500,000-plus jobs a month and as many over the first four months of this year as in most complete years over the past decade cannot continue at that pace, and this means the ability to move jobs and receive higher wage increases because of the high competition for workers will decline. There will be a lasting awareness among workers that they can join together and demand more of employers, whether it is pay or benefits or company values. ""That awareness won't just go away,"" Shierholz said.The recent pay increases from Microsoft and Apple are a recognition of the increased power of workers from companies with the biggest profit levels in the market. But an inflationary truth that will remain is that a $22 per-hour wage for a worker in an Apple retail store is a lot less three years from now. ""These wage gains won't be reduced, but we are still going to have inflation. It is a constant thing. It's not like now that we've gotten these wage increases, it's mission accomplished. There is still so far to go,"" Shierholz said. With two job openings for every worker, power remains tilted to the worker, and economists say it is difficult to envision a situation in which employers get back all the power that has shifted in recent years. ""We just don't have the people to fill those jobs and employers will have to give a little. We have never been here before, never had this many job openings,"" Vankudre said.Employers have already become more flexible on conditions like hybrid work, and in terms of benefits and training being offered, but pay is not keeping pace with inflation in real terms.""There was an expectation that everyone [employers] would make market adjustments and that didn't really happen,"" Vankudre said.Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on a record job recovery.""Now is the time to get your wage gains if you can,"" Shierholz said."
2022-05-27,"Signs that inflation is at least starting to abate from a 40-year high could be a positive for stocks, according to Goldman Sachs.Markets rallied Friday as a government report showed the pace of inflation slowed a bit in April, primarily due to falling gas prices but also from other factors that at least suggested the run-up was cooling.Goldman analysts said history indicates the market will react positively when inflation shows signs of peaking.""The market usually falls in the run up to the peak in headline inflation, just as we have seen in recent months,"" a team of analysts led by Sharon Bell said in a note. ""But after the peaks, there is a little more variance and on average the market does recover.""In 13 inflation runs since 1951, the market was higher 12 months later nine times. The biggest gain was a 33.2% increase from the March 1980 top; the worst was a 17.3% decline from the January 2001 peak, a time when the market languished after the dotcom bubble popped.""In truth the peak in inflation might be helpful but equities really need other supports, especially if investors fear a sharper downturn,"" Goldman's team wrote.Key components needed to boost market momentum include a strong economy, low valuations and falling interest rates.All of those issues present a challenge in the current environment. The economy contracted at 1.5% annualized rate in the first quarter, stock market valuations have come down significantly but remain just above their 10-year average, and interest rates are on the rise, though bond yields are off their highs.October 1990 was positive in all three regards and saw a 29.1% increase in the S&P 500 over the next year, a ""very different set-up from the one we have today,"" Goldman said.Markets also drew encouragement this week from the Federal Reserve. Minutes from the policy meeting earlier this month indicated that officials are willing to reexamine the pace of interest rate hikes later this year, but they also noted the possibility of rates going into a ""restrictive"" level aimed at slowing the economy.The Goldman strategists said the picture for Europe and the U.S. is similar.The firm reiterated its positive outlook on European stocks with strong balance sheets, high and stable profit margins and companies that benefit from rising capital expenditures and government investment. Goldman is still cautious on consumer stocks even with the potential for falling inflation."

BEIJING — Major Chinese cities Beijing and Shanghai began to relax Covid controls over the weekend as the local case count dropped.Nationwide, the number of new cases with symptoms on the mainland fell to 20 on Sunday, down from 54 a day earlier. The capital city of Beijing reported eight new Covid cases for Sunday, while Shanghai recorded six.The loosening of restrictions comes about two months after Shanghai, China's largest city, ordered people to stay in their apartments for mass virus testing. Beijing city had begun tightening Covid controls about a month ago, but only locked down some neighborhoods.On Sunday, Shanghai authorities said businesses could start to reopen without having to apply for approval starting Wednesday. A shopping area called Xintiandi — including a local Shake Shack — was among those set to resume some offline operations Wednesday, according to state media.The city also announced a raft of measures to support businesses, especially those that had minimal layoffs. To stimulate consumption, the city said it would give 10,000 yuan ($1,493) to any individual switching to a battery-powered car this year.As of Sunday, Shanghai claimed that only 220,000 people remained subject to the most restrictive stay-home orders, and that more than 22 million were allowed to venture out into the community. In Beijing, major shopping centers, including a luxury mall that temporarily closed a month ago due to Covid, announced they would reopen as of Sunday. Hotels in the rural outskirts of the capital city could also reopen. An amusement park called Happy Valley Beijing said it planned to reopen on Tuesday.Ride-hailing and most public transport resumed in the main business area, while more people were allowed to return to work. Some libraries, museums and gyms could reopen at half their capacity, if no Covid cases were found in the past seven days at a community level.However, restaurants in Beijing can still only operate on a takeout or delivery basis, with no customers dining inside.

What to know about the new investing landscape After the latest Covid outbreak, both Shanghai and Beijing require a valid negative virus test in order to enter public areas. In Beijing, test results are only valid for 48 hours, while Shanghai said beginning Wednesday, test results will be valid for 72 hours.It remains unclear how quickly most businesses will be able to resume normal production as implementation of Covid measures can vary at a neighborhood level. Any new confirmed Covid cases or contacts with one can result in renewed tightening.Clients in Beijing ""question the magnitude of the growth rebound"" even after a relaxation of Covid controls, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report Sunday.""Local clients worry about scarring effects from anti-pandemic measures and growth slowdown, which include heightened uncertainties around economic and policy outlook, a higher number of bankruptcies and elevated unemployment rates,"" the analysts said."
2022-05-30,"Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Monday he expects 50 basis point interest rate hikes to continue.The central bank official said he would support hikes that exceed the ""neutral"" level, currently pegged around 2.5% for the Fed's benchmark borrowing rate.Waller added that he thinks the Fed can raise rates and tamp down demand without causing a severe economic downturn Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Monday he sees interest rate increases continuing through the rest of the year as part of an effort to bring inflation under control.Specifically, the central bank official said he would support hikes that exceed the ""neutral"" level considered neither supportive nor restrictive for growth.Estimates Fed officials provided in March point to a 2.5% neutral level, so that means Waller sees rates increasing at least another 2 percentage points from here.""Over a longer period, we will learn more about how monetary policy is affecting demand and how supply constraints are evolving,"" Waller said in remarks delivered in Frankfurt, Germany. ""If the data suggest that inflation is stubbornly high, I am prepared to do more.""The statements support sentiment reflected in minutes from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting held in early May. The meeting summary said officials believe ""a restrictive stance of policy may well become appropriate depending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook.""Markets currently are expecting the Fed to raise benchmark borrowing rates to a range between 2.5%-2.75%, in line with a neutral rate. However, if inflation continues to rise, the Fed likely will go even further. The fed funds rate currently is set between 0.75% and 1%.Minutes also indicated that policymakers see rates rising by 50 basis points at the next several meetings. Waller said he is on board with that position, as the Fed seeks to tame inflation running close to its highest level in more than 40 years.""In particular, I am not taking 50 basis-point hikes off the table until I see inflation coming down closer to our 2 percent target,"" Waller said. ""And, by the end of this year, I support having the policy rate at a level above neutral so that it is reducing demand for products and labor, bringing it more in line with supply and thus helping rein in inflation.""Data released Friday indicated that inflation still accelerated in April but at a slower pace. Core personal consumption expenditures, which is the metric the Fed watches closest, increased 4.9% for the month from a year ago, down from 5.2% in March. Headline PCE inflation, including food and energy costs, rose 6.3%, compared to 6.6% the previous month.Waller added that he thinks the Fed can raise rates and tamp down demand without causing a severe economic downturn. In part, the Fed's aim will be to reduce labor demand without causing a big rise in the unemployment rate. There are currently 5.6 million more job openings than there are available workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.""Of course, the path of the economy depends on many factors, including how the Ukraine war and COVID-19 evolve. From this discussion, I am left optimistic that the strong labor market can handle higher rates without a significant increase in unemployment,"" he said."
2022-05-30,"As the war in Ukraine and pandemic disruptions continue to wreak havoc on supply chains, stagflation is here to stay — marked by low growth and high inflation ""for at least the next 12 months,"" Simon Baptist, global chief economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. The pandemic as well as the war in Ukraine have stifled supply of commodities and goods and upended efficient distribution through global supply chains, forcing up prices of everyday goods such as fuel and food.AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver doesn't see the recession writing on the wall either, at least not for another 18 months.  A global recession is not imminent, but brace for rising costs and slower growth, economists say. ""There will be no sudden 'after' of stagflation,"" said Simon Baptist, global chief economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, referring to a surprise recession after a period of stagflation.As the war in Ukraine and pandemic disruptions continue to wreak havoc on supply chains, stagflation — marked by low growth and high inflation — will stick around ""for at least the next 12 months,"" Baptist told CNBC last week.""Commodity prices will start to ease from next quarter, but will remain permanently higher than before the war in Ukraine for the simple reason that Russian supplies of many commodities will be permanently reduced,"" he added.The pandemic as well as the war in Ukraine have stifled supply of commodities and goods and upended efficient distribution through global supply chains, forcing up prices of everyday goods such as fuel and food.But, while higher prices will cause pain for households, growth in many parts of the world, while slow, is still ticking over and job markets have not collapsed. Unemployment levels across many economies have reached their lowest in decades.  So, consumers — while wary of a repeat of the last global recession brought on by the U.S. subprime crisis over 10 years ago — need not start preparing for a recession. ""For almost all economies of Asia, a recession is fairly unlikely, if we're talking about successive periods of negative GDP,"" Baptist told CNBC's Street Signs on Thursday. Even if the global economy is at risk of a recession, many consumers have ample savings and have stocked up on household durables, the economist said.""So to an extent, it won't feel as bad as the immediate numbers look,"" he said. AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver doesn't see the recession writing on the wall either, at least not for another 18 months.  ""Yield curves or the gap between long-term bond yields and short-term rates have yet to decisively invert or warn of recession and even if they do now the average lead to recession is 18 months,"" he said in a note. He takes the view that a deep bear market can be avoided in the U.S. and in Australia. At the same time, central banks across the globe are tightening up interest rates to combat inflation.The U.S. central bank announced its biggest rate hike in more than 22 years earlier this month, raising its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point and warning of further rate hikes. Federal Reserve minutes released Wednesday indicated that officials were prepared to move ahead with multiple 50 basis points interest rate increases, as they attempt to bring down inflation.  Last week, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which has been tightening more than other central banks, raised its cash rate by another half a percentage point to 2%. It was the central bank's fifth rate hike in a row, and signaled the cash rate would peak at a higher level than previously forecast.  The rate has now risen by 1.75 percentage points since the tightening cycle started in October. ""We are very committed to making sure that actual inflation tracks back to within our target range of 1 to 3% and at 6.9%, we are well north of that … we are resolute in our determination to contain inflation,"" governor Adrian Orr said.  But there is always a risk the control of inflation will induce a recession, economists say. Stagflation is notoriously hard to control as reining in high prices through raising interest rates could lead to even lower growth.""The longer inflation stays high the more investment markets worry that central banks will not be able to tame it without bringing on recession. As Fed Chair Powell indicated, getting inflation to 2% will 'include some pain,'"" Oliver said. But not everyone is concerned.Capital Economics senior economic advisor Vicky Redwood said she was confident central banks would be able to dial down inflation without engineering a recession. Planned rate rises in many places — such as in Europe, the UK and the U.S. — should be sufficient to bring inflation back to target, Redwood said. ""[But] if inflation expectations and inflation prove more stubborn than we expect, and interest rates need to rise further as a result, then a recession most probably will be on the cards,"" she said in a note. A Volcker-shock style recession might even be warranted, she added. The Volcker Shock occurred when Fed Chairman Paul Volcker raised  interest rates to the highest point in history in the 1980s, in an effort to end double-digit inflation in the U.S."
2022-05-31,"With a stated target of increasing annual bilateral trade to more than $10 billion over the next five years, the trade agreement is the largest ever between Israel and any Arab country. The signing opened ""a new chapter in the history of the Middle East,"" Emirati Trade Minister Thani Al Zeyoudi wrote on Twitter.The signing of the deal came amid renewed violence between Israelis and Palestinians.  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Israel and the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday penned a multi-billion dollar free trade agreement, the latest product of the two countries' historic normalization deal in 2020 known as the Abraham Accords.With a stated target of increasing annual bilateral trade to more than $10 billion over the next five years, the trade agreement is the largest ever between Israel and any Arab country. It covers 96% of the trade between the two Middle Eastern countries, which last year reached $885 million, according to Israel's economy minister.To illustrate the sheer speed and scope of trade between the UAE and Israel that's taken place since the two established official relations in August of 2020, that bilateral figure is more than twice the volume of Israel's trade with Egypt in 2021, which was $330 million — and Israel and Egypt have had a peace agreement in place since 1979.Israel's Minister of Economy and Industry Orna Barbivai and her counterpart, UAE Minister of Economy Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, signed the deal in Dubai following months of negotiations.The signing opened ""a new chapter in the history of the Middle East,"" Emirati Trade Minister Thani Al Zeyoudi wrote on Twitter. ""Our agreement will accelerate growth, create jobs and lead to a new era of peace, stability, and prosperity across the region.""For Jon Medved, CEO of the crowdfunding platform OurCrowd and venture capitalist in Israel's tech scene, trust between the two countries is key to seeing more investment.""Trust is not something you can build in a month or two, but I think there is enormous goodwill,"" Medved told CNBC's Dan Murphy ahead of the deal's signing. His firm has already invested in the UAE, hired employees in the Gulf and received a regulatory status from Abu Dhabi Global Market, a UAE free zone.""While I think trust isn't something that you snap your fingers and it instantly happens, I think the steps are being taken on a political level and a human level that are creating trust and this is going to lead to extraordinary business opportunities,"" Medved said. The signing of the deal came amid renewed violence between Israelis and Palestinians.On Monday, thousands of Israeli nationalists surrounded the Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, the third-holiest site in Islam, chanting anti-Muslim slurs, with some physically attacking Palestinians and a few arrested for spraying a Palestinian journalist with tear gas. The demonstrators had gathered for the commemoration of Israel's capture of Jerusalem's Old City in the Six Day War of 1967.The UAE's foreign ministry in a statement Monday condemned what it described as the ""storming"" of the Al-Aqsa compound by ""extremist settlers under the protection of Israeli forces."" It also asked that Israeli authorities ""take responsibility for reducing escalation and ending all attacks and practices that lead to the continuation of tensions.""Other cities and towns in the West Bank also saw violence and attacks on homes in Palestinian neighborhoods by groups of Israelis. More than 160 Palestinians were injured, with some of those hit by live bullets after staging a counter-protest, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett condemned extremist behavior and vowed that anyone involved would be arrested.On Monday, media who had been invited to the signing of the trade deal were told they could no longer attend, Reuters reported, noting that no reason had been given for the sudden change.Al Aqsa is located the Old City of majority-Arab East Jerusalem, which has been annexed by Israel since 1967 but is not recognized internationally. Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is classified by the United Nations as a violation of international law.The growing economic relationship between Israel and the UAE, a Muslim country officially supportive of Palestinian statehood, has so far remained largely untouched by the countries' political differences over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

2022-05-31,"You know things are getting bad when we get to the ""President-summons-Fed-Chief-to-White-House"" stage of a crisis. And here we are, with President Biden set to hold such a meeting with Fed Chair Jay Powell this afternoon. The public nature of the event is part of its point; in case there was any doubt, President Biden simultaneously published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal today titled ""My Plan for Fighting Inflation.""  His three-point plan places primary emphasis, as it should, on it being the Fed's ""primary responsibility to control inflation."" Biden pledges that he will let the Fed fight inflation as it sees fit without interfering; the subtext is that he will do so even if their hawkishness slows the economy and further hits the markets into the midterm elections. Perhaps to illustrate that point, Fed Governor Chris Waller gave a rather hawkish speech yesterday saying he supports half-point rate hikes for ""several meetings"" and won't take them off the table ""until I see inflation coming down closer to our 2 percent target."" It confirms what WSJ Fed reporter Nick Timiraos hinted at with a Twitter thread into the weekend--that the market has gotten too dovish in expecting only one or two more half-point hikes.  The second plank of the President's inflation-fighting plan includes a bunch of targeted inflation-fighting measures, like having Congress pass ""clean energy tax credits and investments"" that he was told will lower household utility bills by $500 a year; going after the ocean freight oligopoly he blames for pushing up shipping costs; building a million houses under a ""Housing Supply Action Plan""; letting Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices; and lowering the cost of elder and child care (the latter in particular the subject of much concern that it would raise costs instead).  The trouble here is that many of these problems were worsened by too much stimulus colliding with the aftermath of the pandemic, resulting in demand for energy, goods, and housing snapping back way stronger than markets could handle. Take the refinery shortage, for instance, that's creating gasoline and diesel bottlenecks and further pushing up prices; ""Few could have predicted the speed with which the U.S. economy recovered from the initial shutdown,"" one economist told the WSJ. Except that several outlier voices have been trying to warn for over a year now that the data was showing a V-shaped snapback while the consensus kept carrying on about ""K-shaped"" rebounds and warning about ""The Second Great Depression."" I've written extensively about the work of MKM's Michael Darda, for instance, who has absolutely nailed the tremendous rebound in nominal GDP and warned others were missing it. David Woo left Wall Street in frustration after how little pushback President Biden's $1.9 trillion ""American Rescue Plan"" garnered last March. And that's the final point to make regarding the Biden-Powell summit today. It comes as NBC News has released an extensively reported feature piece, called ""A Biden White House Adrift."" Record-high inflation is one of the biggest challenges mentioned. The piece quotes one anonymous official as lamenting that, like Biden used to say of President Obama, 'everything landed on his desk but locusts.' Except that inflation didn't ""happen"" to this White House; it was accelerated by the massive American Rescue Plan, which awkwardly remains Biden's ""biggest achievement.""  ""We put gasoline on fire. That's basically what the ARP did,"" as one policy wonk told Vox earlier this month, citing San Francisco Fed research that it pushed up the CPI by an additional three percentage-points. The Fed itself, however, does bear equal fault for running monetary policy full steam ahead at the same time; this is again made clear in reading through Ben Bernanke's recent book on Fed history, wherein fiscal and monetary policy is most potent--and dangerous--when pointing in the same direction.  The hope now is that fiscal and monetary policy are at least both retrenching, if policymakers truly want to wrestle inflation back down. Remember, this isn't about soaring (or collapsing) lumber prices anymore. It's about a labor market running so hot it's short of millions and millions of workers, which will make everything from childcare to elder care more inflationary in the long run. The President himself writes today that ""if average monthly job creation shifts in the next year from current levels of 500,000 to something closer to 150,000, it will be a sign that we are successfully moving into the next phase of recovery.""  The third and final plank of Biden's inflation-fighting plan is ""to keep reducing the federal deficit."" But again, part of that effort is to expand the size of the IRS--to bring in more revenue, obviously--and to raise corporate and individual taxes. The White House is walking a much finer line than many realize here, because higher taxes (and a larger government sector) are a supply-side hit to to the economy right now.  Once inflation gets political, it rarely ends well.  See you at 1 p.m! KellyTwitter: @KellyCNBCInstagram: @realkellyevans"
2022-05-31,"The Chinese government faces a growing shortfall of cash, analysts say, as they predict an increase of debt to fill the gap.The analysts did not share specific figures on how much additional debt might be needed. But they pointed to growing pressure on growth that would require more support from debt.Nomura estimates a funding gap of about 6 trillion yuan ($895.52 billion) — roughly 2.5 trillion yuan in decreased revenue due to tax refunds and weaker economic production, and another 3.5 trillion yuan of lost land sales revenue. BEIJING — The Chinese government faces a growing shortfall of cash, analysts say, as they predict an increase of debt to fill the gap.""The latest wave of Omicron and the widespread lockdowns in place since mid-March have resulted in a sharp contraction in government revenue, including land sales revenue,"" Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, and a team said in a report last week.They estimate a funding gap of about 6 trillion yuan ($895.52 billion) — roughly 2.5 trillion yuan in decreased revenue due to tax refunds and weaker economic production, and another 3.5 trillion yuan of lost land sales revenue.""Much of the incoming 'stimulus measures', be it special government bonds or incremental lending by policy banks, will be merely used to fill this funding gap,"" the Nomura analysts said.It's that 3.5 trillion yuan figure they expect will be hard to fill, and they listed several measures, from using fiscal deposits to increasing borrowing, that could be used to make up the shortfall.Economic data for April showed weakening growth as Covid controls took a toll. Premier Li Keqiang said during a rare nationwide meeting last week that in some respects, the difficulties were greater than in 2020. Even before the latest Covid outbreak, land sales, a significant source of local government revenue, have plunged following Beijing's crackdown on real estate developers' high reliance on debt. Local governments are also responsible for implementing tax cuts and refunds that Beijing has announced to support growth.The Japanese bank and analysts from other firms did not share specific figures on how much additional debt might be needed. But they pointed to growing pressure on growth that would require more support from debt.Excluding tax cuts and refunds, the Ministry of Finance said local fiscal revenue grew by 5.4% during the first four months of the year from a year ago. Eight of China's 31 province-level regions saw a drop in fiscal revenue during that time, the ministry said, without naming them.Incomplete data for the period from Wind Information showed the regions of Qinghai, Shandong, Liaoning, Hebei, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan and Tianjin posted year-on-year declines in fiscal revenue for the first four months of the year. Tianjin was the worst with a 27% decline.In 2021, Tibet was the only province-level region to see a decline in fiscal revenue, according to Wind.It's ""important to notice that the decline of fiscal revenue happened not only in cities under lockdown,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist, Pinpoint Asset Management.""Many cities without Omicron outbreaks also suffered, as their economies are linked to those currently under lockdown,"" Zhang said in an email in mid-May. ""The economic costs are not limited to a small number of cities, it is a national problem."" Since March, mainland China has sought to control its worst Covid outbreak in two years with stay-home orders and travel restrictions in many parts of the country, notably Shanghai and the surrounding region.Although financial data isn't readily available for many Chinese cities, the southern tech hub of Shenzhen released figures showing a 44% year-on-year drop in fiscal revenue in April to 25.53 billion yuan. That followed a 7% year-on-year decline in March to 22.95 billion yuan.""The local governments face mounting fiscal pressure. Their expenditure is rising but revenue dropping,"" Zhang said. ""Land sales are down sharply as well. I think the central government may have to revise the fiscal budget and issue more debt to help the local governments.""Beijing in March already announced an increase in transfer of funds from the central to local governments. When asked in May whether that would be expanded, the Ministry of Finance noted some funding for next year would be transferred ahead of time to help local governments with tax refunds and cuts this year. To Susan Chu, senior director at S&P Global Ratings, she's more concerned about the deficit, the decline in revenue versus spending. Land sales don't create deficit pressure, she said, noting that ""more pressure will come from infrastructure spending, tax cut allocation.""A ""widening deficit means there's a chance of more borrowing or debt burden in the future,"" Chu said in a phone interview earlier this month. While she doesn't expect off-budget borrowing will come back, she said it is an important signal to watch for assessing risk.In late April, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a nationwide push to develop infrastructure ranging from waterways to cloud computing infrastructure. It was not clear at what scale or timeframe the projects would be constructed.

Inflation at multidecade highs, exacerbated by supply chain disruptions and the coronavirus pandemic, has sown fear that the Fed will inadvertently tip the economy into recession as it combats price increases.  While stocks bounced from a precipitous decline in recent weeks on optimism that inflation may be easing, Dimon seemed to dash hopes that the bottom is in.""Right now, it's kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,"" Dimon said. ""That hurricane is right out there, down the road, coming our way.""There are two main factors that has Dimon worried: First, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will reverse its emergency bond-buying programs and shrink its balance sheet.

Several aspects of quantitative easing programs ""backfired,"" including negative rates, which he called a ""huge mistake.""Central banks ""don't have a choice because there's too much liquidity in the system,"" Dimon said, referring to the tightening actions. ""They have to remove some of the liquidity to stop the speculation, reduce home prices and stuff like that.""The other large factor worrying Dimon is the Ukraine war and its impact on commodities, including food and fuel.

Dimon went on a tear during the hourlong session, barreling through topics like a ""greatest hits"" of his observations and gripes, often letting loose with profanity.He lambasted investors for voting along with proxy advisors like Glass Lewis, which has disagreed with JPMorgan's board on recent matters including executive compensation and whether the bank should separate the chairman and CEO roles in the future.""Shame on you if that's how you vote,"" Dimon said. ""Seriously, you should be embarrassed.

Though inflation measures such as the consumer price index and the Fed's preferred core personal consumption expenditures have come off their recent highs, they are still near levels last seen in the early 1980s.""I don't meet anyone, contacts, consumers, anyone, who thinks the economy needs help from the Fed right now,"" Daly said. ""I certainly am comfortable to do what it takes to get inflation trending down to the level we need it to be. I really think these inflation numbers have been going on too long, and consumers, businesses and everyday Americans are depending on us to get inflation back down and bridling it.""How far Daly and the rest of the Fed are willing to go remains to be seen, and she said that data will dictate how high rates trend.Most Fed officials estimate the ""neutral"" level of their benchmark borrowing rate to be around 2.5%. It currently is targeted in a range between 0.75% and 1%.Daly said issues such as supply chain backlogs, the war in Ukraine and China's economic reopening after a Covid-related shutdown will be factors on whether inflation has peaked. If she doesn't see progress, ""we need to go into restrictive territory,"" she added."
2022-06-02,"Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard told CNBC on Thursday that she doesn't see the central bank taking a break anytime soon from its rate-hiking cycle.""We've still got a lot of work to do to get inflation down to our 2% target,"" she said.Despite worries over inflation, Brainard expressed confidence otherwise in the economy. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said Thursday that it's unlikely the central bank will be taking a break from its current rate-hiking cycle anytime soon.Though she stressed that Fed policymakers will remain data-dependent, Brainard said the most likely path will be that the increases will continue until inflation is tamed.""Right now, it's very hard to see the case for a pause,"" she told CNBC's Sara Eisen during a live ""Squawk on the Street"" interview that was her first since being confirmed to the vice chair position. ""We've still got a lot of work to do to get inflation down to our 2% target.""The idea of implementing two more 50 basis point rate increases over the summer then taking a step back in September has been floated by a few officials, most notably Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. Minutes from the May Federal Open Market Committee meeting indicated some support for the idea of evaluating where things stand in the fall, but there were no commitments.In recent days, however, policymakers including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Governor Christopher Waller have stressed the importance of using the central bank's policy tools aggressively to bring down inflation running around its fastest pace since the early 1980s.""We're certainly going to do what is necessary to bring inflation back down,"" Brainard said. ""That's our No. 1 challenge right now. We are starting from a position of strength. The economy has a lot of momentum.""Economic data lately, though, has been mixed.ADP reported Thursday that private payrolls increased by just 128,000 in May, the slowest month yet for a jobs recovery that started in May 2020. Labor productivity in the first quarter contracted at the fastest pace since 1947, and the Atlanta Fed is tracking an anemic 1.3% growth rate for second-quarter GDP, which contracted 1.5% in the first quarter.Brainard said, however, that bringing inflation down remains the top priority and shouldn't significantly harm an economy where household and corporate balance sheets are strong.Markets already are pricing in two 50 basis point increases at the next meetings, which Brainard called ""a reasonable kind of path."" Beyond that, though, ""it's a little hard to say,"" she added, noting both upside and downside risks to growth.In separate remarks, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester also said she sees consecutive 50 basis point moves ahead. While she noted that the Fed then can evaluate the progress made towards bringing down inflation, she said additional rate increases probably will be needed.""In my view, with inflation as elevated as it is, the funds rate will probably need to go above its longer-run neutral level to rein in inflation,"" Mester said in remarks to the Philadelphia Council for Business Economics. ""But we cannot make that call today because it will depend on how much demand moderates and what happens on the supply side of the economy.""In addition to the rate increases, the Fed in June has begun reducing the asset holdings on its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. The process will entail allowing a capped level of proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off each month and reinvesting the rest.By September, the balance sheet reduction will be as much as $95 billion a month, which Brainard said will equate to two or three more rate hikes by the time the process is finished."
2022-06-02,"Economists expect 328,000 jobs were added in May, down 100,000 from April and likely the start of a new, slower pace of job creation.Even so, economists say the labor market is strong and they expect wages to rise by 0.4% from April.""I don't think there's a swath of people that is out of the labor force and on the cusp of being brought back in. There's roughly two job openings for every unemployed person,"" said one economist. The pace of job growth is expected to have slowed in May, but economists say the labor market remains strong, even as parts of the economy have weakened.Economists forecast that employers added 328,000 new jobs, less than the 428,000 added in April, according to Dow Jones. The unemployment rate is forecast to decline to 3.5% from 3.6%.Average hourly wages are expected to have risen by 0.4%, up from April's 0.3% increase. Year-over-year, wage growth is expected to fall slightly to 5.2%, from 5.4% in April.""I suspect it's the average hourly earnings number that could get people excited,"" said Michael Schumacher, head of macro strategy at Wells Fargo. ""The Fed has been pretty consistent as well - that it's inflation, inflation, inflation. If it's 0.5%, you probably get some reaction. If it's 0.6%, it's pronounced.""Schumacher said a hotter wage number could spark selling in both stocks and bonds, while the market may not react as much if the payrolls number misses the forecast. When bonds sell off, yields go higher.The payroll data is being closely watched for any cracks in the labor market, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. But economists say there are no signs of weakness yet, and it is a part of the economy that is expected to remain strong for now.""The thing about the labor market data is we already have more real-time data that gives us a better indicator,"" said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies. He noted that weekly jobless claims fell unexpectedly to a low 200,000 last week.""We hear these anecdotal reports about X firm cutting Y thousands of jobs. It's either that it isn't really happening yet...or people are being let go and immediately finding another job,"" he said.Monthly job growth has been well above 400,000 for the past year, and economists say just based on the short supply of workers, it will naturally slow down.  Barclays U.S. economist Pooja Sriram said she expects a solid 375,000 payrolls were added in May.""We think the momentum is definitely going to be slowing from here on. That's just the nature of the labor market,"" she said. ""We do expect the participation rate to gradually pick up. We saw the number fall by 0.2 in April, but I think there will be some retracement of that. We expect a 0.1 improvement.""The participation rate is closely watched by economists and shows how many people who are able to work have jobs or are looking for jobs. The rate was 62.2% in April.May's payroll data is expected to still show the impact of returning workers, who may have had Covid-related issues preventing them from working. ""There's a certain cohort of people that want to come back to the labor market because Covid restrictions have eased, and because inflation has picked up,"" said Sriram.The labor market was still short 1.2 million workers in April from pre-pandemic levels, but economists note that many people have retired from the workforce.""We probably are settling into a lower trajectory for job growth. The participation rate has recovered all of the dip we saw in the spring of 2020, related to Covid,"" said Simons. ""I don't think there's a swath of people that is out of the labor force and on the cusp of being brought back in. There's roughly two job openings for every unemployed person.""Simons said he doesn't buy the narrative in markets that the economy is going to slow down, causing the Fed to pause its aggressive interest rates hikes. The central bank raised rates by a half percentage point last month and is expected to raise rates by the same amount later in June and again in July.    ""I find there's a lot of people saying the economy is weakening very broadly, but really I think when people are saying that, they're just thinking about the housing data. There's no way I can argue the housing data is not bad.""Higher mortgage rates combined with rising home prices have had a quick, chilling effect on the real estate market. Existing home sales in April were down 2.4% from March, at the slowest pace since the pandemic started.""The market is also adjusting to a huge increase in the cost of financing home purchases over the past few months, and it's natural we'll get a slowdown,"" Simons said. ""The Fed wants that. I don't think we're seeing a big collapse in housing."" He noted that ISM manufacturing data continues to show a robust economy.""Consumer spending is still strong and that's going to be supported by a strong labor market and wages,"" he said.However, Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said the housing market could be a ""canary in the coal mine"" for the economy.She expects that the job market could ultimately be hurt by Fed tightening as well. She expects 375,000 new jobs were added to payrolls in May, but during the summer and into the fall, job growth could decline. She said it could fall back to a more normal pace in line with the average 186,000 payrolls per month added in the decade before the pandemic.""We could see some declines,"" she said. Fed officials ""are starting to frame out what a softish landing is, and it's unemployment higher than the current rate. It's hard to get there without some declines in jobs at some point in time."""
2022-06-02,"Private payrolls increased by just 128,000 in May, the lowest gain of the pandemic-era recovery, according to ADP.Small business took the biggest hit during the month, as companies employing fewer than 50 workers reduced payrolls by 91,000.Leisure and hospitality, the sector most hit most by restrictions and which has been a leader throughout the recovery, saw new hires of just 17,000.Weekly jobless claims fell to 200,000, a sign that while hiring may be slowing, layoffs are not accelerating. Job creation at companies decelerated to the slowest pace of the pandemic-era recovery in May, payroll processing firm ADP reported Thursday.Private sector employment rose by just 128,000 for the month, falling well short of the 299,000 Dow Jones estimate and a decline from the downwardly revised 202,000 in April, initially reported as a gain of 247,000.The big drop-off marked the worst month since the massive layoffs in April 2020, when companies sent home more than 19 million workers as the Covid outbreak triggered a massive economic shutdown.By ADP's count — which usually differs somewhat from government figures — payrolls had increased by nearly 500,000 a month over the past year.May's slowdown in hiring comes amid fears of a broader economic pullback. Inflation running around its highest level in 40 years, the ongoing war in Ukraine and a Covid-induced shutdown in China, which since has been lifted though with conditions, have generated fears that the U.S. could be on the brink of recession.Small business took the biggest hit during the month, as companies employing fewer than 50 workers reduced payrolls by 91,000. Of that decline, 78,000 layoffs came from businesses with fewer than 20 employees.""Under a backdrop of a tight labor market and elevated inflation, monthly job gains are closer to pre-pandemic levels,"" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. ""The job growth rate of hiring has tempered across all industries, while small businesses remain a source of concern as they struggle to keep up with larger firms that have been booming as of late.""In other economic data Thursday, initial jobless claims for the week ended May 28 totaled 200,000, a decline of 11,000 from the previous week and below the 210,000 estimate, according to the Labor Department.Continuing claims fell to 1.31 million, the lowest total since Dec. 27, 1969, and indicative that while hiring may be slowing, the pace of layoffs looks muted.Also, first-quarter productivity was revised slightly higher but still reflected a decline of 7.3%, the biggest tumble since 1947. Unit labor costs jumped by 12.6%, the biggest increase since the third quarter of 1982, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The biggest change in the ADP count came in leisure and hospitality, the sector most hit most by restrictions and which has been a leader throughout the recovery. May saw new hires of just 17,000, even as the summer tourism season gets set to hit full swing.Education and health services led sectors with growth of 46,000, while professional and business services was next with 23,000 and manufacturing added 22,000. Service-providing jobs grew by 104,000, while good producers added 24,000.Companies with 500 or more workers led with payroll gains of 122,000, while midsize firms contributed 97,000.The report comes the day before the BLS issues its more closely followed nonfarm payrolls count, which is expected to show a gain of 328,000 following April's 428,000. The unemployment rate is forecast to edge down to 3.5%, which would tie for the lowest since December 1969.The BLS count includes government jobs, differing from ADP, which is a tally of private payrolls."

China should not interfere with commercial dealings between Taiwan and the European Union especially when increased economic resilience between the two sides contribute to the benefit of the global economy, a senior Taiwan minister told CNBC.Taiwan would pursue a new free trade agreement with the EU should high-level talks with the bloc over the tightening of semiconductor supply chains yield a wider deal, Taiwan's deputy minister for economic affairs, Chen Chern-Chyi, said Friday.Semiconductor-powerhouse Taiwan is holding rare ministerial-level discussions with the EU to boost its chip industry and supply chain with Europe, while also engaging with the U.S. on new trade talks. The discussions have drawn the ire of Beijing which has called for all parties to observe the one-China policy. Taiwan is democratically self-ruled but Beijing claims the island as part of its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the two together.  ""Beijing always expresses their opposition to our economic cooperation with our partners but this is for the global benefit, for the welfare of humankind,"" Chen said during an exclusive interview on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia.""""I think third parties should not intervene or obstruct this kind of positive cooperation between parties."" Chen said Taiwan's discussions with the EU and the U.S. were imperative to the resilience of the global supply chains.To that end, Taiwan regularly looks to shore up its trade dealings with its global partners and the EU is no different, particularly given that the bloc is Taiwan's fifth largest trading partner with 50 billion euros ($53.8 billion) in bilateral trade. Taiwan is a key supplier of semiconductor chips to many European manufacturers, Chen added. The Taiwanese official also said he is not expecting a backlash from Beijing but Taiwan's 40-year history of ""managing mainland China"" will hold them in good stead in handling any fallout. High-level talks like the one with the EU help to advance Taiwan toward its goals of cutting as many trade deals as possible including one with the EU. Taiwan has also expressly asked to join the new U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework even though it was left out of the initial 13-country membership, Chen said. Taiwan's membership to the IPEF would help meet one of the framework's key tenets, that is, stronger supply chain resilience in the region, Chen added. ""We will pursue that goal to have enhanced and institutional trade relations with the EU. We have endeavored to have this with the U.S. and to join in multilateral trade deals like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and we will not give up and continue our efforts,"" Chen said. ""To include Taiwan into IPEF makes sense and is important.""

What to know about the new investing landscape Political observers have said the U.S. did not include Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific Partnership to avoid a political storm with Beijing, particularly on the recognition of the One-China policy. ""For the U.S., allowing Taiwan to join the IPEF framework under the same name runs the risk of providing legitimacy to arrangements that degrade or belittle Taiwan's sovereignty,"" political scholars Yao-Yuan Yeh, Charles K. S. Wu, Fang-Yu Chen, and Austin Horng-En Wang said in a recent analysis in the Diplomat. ""The name of 'Taiwan' is a non-starter, too, as it would challenge the current U.S. One China policy.""Additionally, excluding Taiwan would have allowed other Asian countries — not willing to offend China —to join the IPEF, other analysts have said. Separately, Taiwan has applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), alongside mainland China. The CPTPP — the second largest trade bloc in Asia-Pacific — is conditional on approval by all 11 members of the bloc. It has its genesis in the original U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Donald Trump formally withdrew from in 2017.When asked if Taiwan would influence Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, to increase its tie-up with Europe, Chen said it was up to TSMC to make its own commercial decisions.

2022-06-03,"Nonfarm payrolls increased by 390,000 in May, above the 328,000 Dow Jones estimate.The unemployment rate held at 3.6%, while a more encompassing jobless rate edged higher to 7.1%.Average hourly earnings rose slightly less than expected but were still up 5.2% from a year ago.Leisure and hospitality led gains, followed by professional and business services then warehousing and transportation. The U.S. economy added 390,000 jobs in May, better than expected despite fears of an economic slowdown and with a roaring pace of inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.At the same time, the unemployment rate held at 3.6%, just above the lowest level since December 1969.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for nonfarm payrolls to expand by 328,000 and the unemployment rate to edge lower to 3.5%. May's total represented a pullback from the upwardly revised 436,000 in April and was the lowest monthly gain since April 2021.""Despite the slight cooldown, the tight labor market is clearly sticking around and is shrugging off fears of a downturn,"" said Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor's senior economist. ""We continue to see signs of a healthy and competitive job market, with no signs of stepping on the brakes yet.""Average hourly earnings increased 0.3% from April, slightly lower than the 0.4% estimate. The year-over-year increase for wages of 5.2% was in line with expectations.Stock market futures were volatile and pointed to a lower open on Wall Street following the report. Government bond yields moved higher.Job gains were broad-based. Leisure and hospitality led, adding 84,000 positions. Professional and business services rose by 75,000, transportation and warehousing contributed 47,000, and construction jobs increased by 36,000.Other areas that saw notable gains included state government education (36,000), private education (33,000), health care (28,000), manufacturing (18,000) and wholesale trade (14,000).Retail trade took a hit on the month, however, losing 61,000 in May, though the BLS noted that the sector remains 159,000 above its February 2020 pre-pandemic level.""That's not really consistent with a consumer that's itching to spend on goods,"" Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management, said of the retail numbers. ""The accommodation and food services story is telling you people have shifted from goods spending to services spending. The real question is how long will they sustain that.""Despite the job gains, the BLS household survey showed that the labor market has yet to recover all the positions lost during the pandemic. Total employment remains 440,000 below the pre-Covid level.Labor force participation edged higher, rising to 62.3% though still 1.1 percentage points below February 2020, as the labor force is smaller by 207,000 from that mark.A more encompassing measure of unemployment that takes into account those not looking for jobs and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons moved higher to 7.1%, up one-tenth of a percentage point from April. Unemployment for Asians fell to 2.4%, the lowest in nearly three years, while the rate for Blacks was 6.2%, an increase of 0.3 percentage point.Revisions to the March and April job estimates shaved 22,000 off the previously reported totals.Matus said the market reaction probably indicates that investors are both anticipating more Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and a slowing jobs market. Fed officials have said they are looking to bring the jobs picture back into balance from the current high demand and low labor supply.""I wouldn't call it the calm before the storm, but it might be the last bit of sunlight before the clouds get a little deeper and darker,"" Matus said.The report comes amid fears that higher inflation along with geopolitical developments including the war in Ukraine and Covid restrictions in China could impact a U.S. economy that contracted at a 1.5% rate in the first quarter.Though there have been recent signs that inflation could be slowing, the current pace is still around the fastest in 40 years. Prices at the pump specifically are at historical highs, with a gallon of regular unleaded at $4.76, up 13% from a month ago and more than 56% from a year ago, according to AAA.That is coming with a slowing economy that is currently on track to grow just at a 1.3% rate in the second quarter, according to the Federal Reserve.In an effort to control inflation, the Fed is trying to slow the economy with a series of interest rate hikes. Fed Governor Lael Brainard told CNBC on Thursday that she anticipates further increases in the months ahead until inflation comes down to the central bank's 2% goal.Businesses have been hampered in the current environment, not least by a shortage of workers that has left nearly two job openings for every available worker. A Fed report earlier this week said businesses are expressing increasing concerns about future prospects – eight of the central bank's 12 districts reported slowing growth while four specifically cited recession fears."

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and needs to cut about 10% of jobs at the electric carmaker, he said in an email to executives seen by Reuters.The message, sent on Thursday and titled ""pause all hiring worldwide"", came two days after the billionaire told staff to return to the workplace or leave, and adds to a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders about the risks of recession.Tesla employed almost 100,000 people at the company and its subsidiaries at the end of 2021, according to its annual SEC filing.The company was not immediately available for comment.Tesla shares fell nearly 3% in U.S. premarket trade on Friday and its Frankfurt-listed stock was down 3.6% after the Reuters report. U.S. Nasdaq futures turned negative and were trading 0.6% lower. Musk has warned in recent weeks about the risk of a recession, but his email ordering a hiring freeze and staff cuts was the most direct and high-profile message of its kind from the head of an automaker.So far, demand for Tesla cars and other electric vehicles has remained strong and many of the traditional indicators of a downturn - including increasing dealer inventories and incentives in the United States - have not materialized.But Tesla has struggled to restart production at its Shanghai factory after Covid-19 lockdowns forced costly outages at the plant.""Musk's bad feeling is shared by many people,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macroeconomic research at Dutch bank ING. ""But we are not talking about global recession. We expect a cooling of the global economy towards the end of the year. The U.S. will cool off, while China and Europe are not going to rebound.""Musk's gloomy outlook echoes recent comments from executives including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs President John Waldron.A ""hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way,"" Dimon said this week.Inflation in the United States is hovering at 40-year highs and has caused a jump in the cost of living for Americans, while the Federal Reserve faces the difficult task of dampening demand enough to curb inflation while not causing a recession.Musk, the world's richest man according to Forbes, did not elaborate on the reasons for his ""super bad feeling"" about the economic outlook in the brief email seen by Reuters.A number of analysts have cut price targets for Tesla recently, forecasting slower deliveries due to Chinese lockdowns and lost output at its Shanghai plant, a hub supplying electric vehicles to China and for export.China accounted for just over a third of Tesla's global deliveries in 2021, according to company disclosures and data released on sales there.Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a tweet it appeared Musk and Tesla were ""trying to be ahead of a slower delivery ramp this year and preserve margins ahead of an economic slowdown.""'Pause all hiring'Before Musk's warning, Tesla had about 5,000 job postings on LinkedIn from sales in Tokyo and engineers at its new Berlin gigafactory to deep learning scientists in Palo Alto. It had scheduled an online hiring event for Shanghai on June 9 on its WeChat channel.Musk's demand that staff return to the office has already faced pushback in Germany.""Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week,"" Musk wrote in his Tuesday email. ""If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned.""Musk has referred to the risk of a recession repeatedly in recent comments.Remotely addressing a conference in mid-May in Miami Beach, Musk said: ""I think we are probably in a recession and that recession will get worse."" He added: ""It'll probably be some tough going for, I don't know, a year, maybe 12 to 18 months, is usually the amount of time that it takes for a correction to happen.""In late May, when asked by a Twitter user whether the economy was approaching a recession, Musk said: ""Yes, but this is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.""Musk also engaged on Thursday in a Twitter spat with Australia tech billionaire and Atlassian Plc co-founder Scott Farquhar, who ridiculed the back-to-office directive as ""like something out of the 1950s"".Musk tweeted: ""recessions serve a vital economic cleansing function"", in response to a tweet by Farquhar who encouraged Tesla employees to look into its remote work positions.Jason Stomel, founder of tech talent agency Cadre said of the return-to-work directive: ""I think there's potential that this is just a disguised layoff, meaning they're able to get rid of people with attrition, or without having to actually have a layoff.""""(Musk) knows there's a percentage of workers who are just not going to come back,"" which he said would be cheaper because no severance would be needed."

2022-06-06,"Amid the fanfare of U.S. President Joe Biden's new Indo-Pacific strategy, China flew under the radar focusing instead on growing trade under RCEP.Consistent with its support of multilateralism and globalization, China is likely to continue promoting the adoption of RCEP which as this grants member states  market access which IPEF lacks.Beijing has laid out a blueprint for how Chinese businesses on how to expand trade and find opportunities through RCEP and Chinese provinces were on board. Amid the fanfare of U.S. President Joe Biden's new Indo-Pacific strategy, China flew under the radar and hosted a high-level discussion on RCEP, the world's largest trade pact.It came days after the Biden administration launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, or IPEF — a partnership which involves 13 countries, excluding China, as the U.S. seeks to expand its political and economic leadership in the Indo-Pacific region.The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) meeting in the southern island of Hainan underscored analysts' expectations that instead of reacting to or countering IPEF, China will likely forge ahead with agreed-upon trade pacts and capitalize on ready-to-go tariffs and market accesses. ""China will not take immediate or very targeted measures to respond to the IPEF,"" said Li Xirui, a trade scholar at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. At the second RCEP Media & Think Tank Forum, held in the Hainan capital of Haikou the weekend after IPEF was announced, non-government trade experts across the region gathered to discuss more ways to expand trade within the bloc. RCEP includes China and the 10-member ASEAN bloc, together with Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.Led by the Hainan government, the meeting also marked another provincial effort to meet Beijing's wider strategy of implementing RCEP since its launch at the start of this year. ""Consistent with its support of multilateralism and globalization, China is likely to continue promoting the adoption of RCEP as this grants member states huge market access, which IPEF lacks,"" Li told CNBC.She said China would likely respond to the U.S. on any of its future Asia-Pacific economic forays by expanding its economic dominance in the region and growing its trade under the RCEP. Beijing would also focus on its applications to join other large-scale trade deals including the second-largest global trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), Li added.China's strategy will be in line with how it, and other states and political observers, views the IPEF — a non-trade deal and Biden's geopolitical rather than economic tilt back into Asia Pacific, Li added.In late May, following the IPEF's launch, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad criticized the Indo-Pacific deal, and said it was a political move by the U.S. to isolate China.Malaysia is one of 13 nations that joined the IPEF which did not include China. Trade specialist Heng Wang, who is at the Herbert Smith Freehills China International Business and Economic Law (CIBEL) Centre at the University of New South Wales, also took the view that China will continue to use market accesses it has under RCEP as they will allow it to deepen its presence in the region. ""RCEP is the only mega regional trade agreement to which China is a party, and China would likely highlight it,"" Wang said.The threat of a competing trade deal by the U.S. however remains a reality, said Henry Gao, associate professor of law at Singapore Management University. ""In case anyone doubts the U.S. vision of the IPEF as the RCEP-killer, the White House stated explicitly in the [IPEF] announcement, that: 'Together, we represent 40% of world GDP,'"" Gao said. ""Why [use] this statement when the IPEF isn't supposed to be about market access?""Gao pointed out the symmetry of comments made by RCEP members, especially China, who have been advertising the fact that the RCEP accounts for 30% of world GDP."" Meanwhile, China has already gained headways with implementing the RCEP since its launch in January, according to Li.It laid out a blueprint for Chinese businesses on how to expand trade and find opportunities through RCEP.Beijing laid out guidelines in six areas including trade and manufacturing, and promoted the use of the Chinese yuan for trading settlement of trading transactions. Authorities also asked businesses to pursue the use of its heavily publicized free-trade port in Hainan which was implementing an independent customs system. Li, who has been watching China's RCEP implementation, pointed out at least 10 provinces including Fujian and Zhejiang had laid out extensive plans to use the RCEP.  Read more about China from CNBC ProThese U.S. stocks have the most to lose — and gain — from ChinaLithium rebounds after a 'freefall' in China.

2022-06-06,"After a surge of omicron cases across the country since March, the nationwide daily Covid case count has fallen to well below 50, according to official data. ""Our high-frequency trackers suggest that barring another severe Covid resurgence and related lockdowns, mobility, construction and ports operation could recover to pre-lockdown levels in around one month,"" Goldman Sachs China Economist Lisheng Wang and a team said in a report Saturday.In a significant step toward normality, the capital city of Beijing allowed most restaurants to resume in-store dining Monday, after a hiatus of about a month. BEIJING — China is starting to show signs of recovery from the latest Covid shock.In a significant step toward normality, the capital city of Beijing allowed restaurants in most districts to resume in-store dining on Monday — after a hiatus of about a month. Most other businesses could also restore in-person operations.The southeastern metropolis of Shanghai, which was locked down for about two months, pressed on with a reopening plan that kicked off last week. Residents flocked to camping sites and local parks over the long weekend holiday that began Friday, according to travel booking site Trip.com.As people returned to work on Monday, a traffic congestion tracker from Baidu showed heavy traffic in Beijing and Shanghai during the morning commute — versus light traffic a week earlier. Both cities also relaxed the frequency of virus tests to three days from two.After a surge of omicron cases across the country since March, the nationwide daily Covid case count has fallen to well below 50, according to official data. Under China's ""dynamic zero-Covid policy"" mandate, local authorities have used strict travel bans and stay-home orders to control the virus. Those restrictions disrupted supply chains and other business, sending retail sales and industrial production falling in April.""Our high-frequency trackers suggest that barring another severe Covid resurgence and related lockdowns, mobility, construction and ports operation could recover to pre-lockdown levels in around one month,"" Goldman Sachs China Economist Lisheng Wang and a team said in a report Saturday.However, businesses in the service sector that involve close human contact would find it challenging to ""achieve a full recovery any time soon,"" the report said. ""The unsynchronized lockdowns and reopenings across major cities suggest that China's ongoing post-lockdown growth recovery should be less steep than the V-shaped one in spring 2020."" Goldman's analysts pointed to the absence of growth drivers such as exports and real estate, and greater economic costs for controlling a Covid variant more transmissible than the one in 2020.Real estate accounts for more than a quarter of China's GDP, according to Moody's.During a press conference last week, People's Bank of China Deputy Governor Pan Gongsheng gave little sign of additional large-scale support for the sector. He noted how the pandemic restricted real estate construction and sales. But he emphasized Beijing's policy of limiting speculation in the sector, and described authorities' latest moves to relax some curbs on real estate loans. Data from last weekend's holiday, called the Dragon Boat Festival, added to indications that the economy won't be snapping back to growth anytime soon.The long weekend movie box office of 178 million yuan ($26.75 million) was the worst Dragon Boat Festival performance since 2012, excluding the worst of the pandemic in 2020, according to ticketing site Maoyan.Spending on domestic tourism during the holiday this year dropped 12.2% from last year, to 25.82 billion yuan ($3.88 billion), according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.But for the calendar year, it marked an improvement from May. The nearly $4 billion figure was about two-thirds the spending during the same holiday in 2019. That was better than the recovery to 44% of pre-pandemic levels during a longer holiday in early May, while Shanghai was still locked down.In the last week, business survey data for manufacturing and services in May showed recovery from April lows. But the data, known as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), remained in contraction territory.The contraction rate is similar to that between February and March, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance. He said that since April's economic indicators declined, the latest figures show the pandemic's impact remained in May and the economy remains in its most severe situation since the second quarter of 2020.

2022-06-07,"The World Bank slashed its global growth forecast on Tuesday to 2.9% for 2022.The bank warned that the world economy could slip into a period of stagflation reminiscent of the 1970s.""For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" World Bank President David Malpass said. The World Bank on Tuesday slashed its global growth forecast and warned that many countries could fall into recession as the economy slips into a period of stagflation reminiscent of the 1970s.Global economic expansion is expected to drop to 2.9% this year from 5.7% in 2021 — 1.2 percentage points lower than the 4.1% predicted in January, the Washington-based bank said in its latest Global Economic Prospects report.Growth is expected to then hover around that level through 2023 to 2024 while inflation remains above target in most economies, the report said, pointing to stagflation risks.Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resultant surge in commodity prices have compounded existing Covid pandemic-induced damage to the global economy, which the World Bank said is now entering what may be ""a protracted period of feeble growth and elevated inflation.""""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" World Bank President David Malpass said.Growth in advanced economies is projected to decelerate sharply to 2.6% in 2022 from 5.1% in 2021 before further moderating to 2.2% in 2023, the report said.

The present high-inflation, weak growth environment has drawn parallels with the 1970s, a period of intense stagflation which required steep increases in interest rates in advanced economies and triggered a string of financial crises in emerging market and developing economies.The World Bank's June report offers what it calls the ""first systematic"" comparison between the situation now and that of 50 years ago. Clear parallels exist between then and now, it said. Those include supply side disturbances, prospects for weakening growth, and the vulnerabilities emerging economies face with respect to the monetary policy tightening that will be needed to rein in inflation.However, there are now also a number of differences, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar, generally lower oil prices, and broadly strong balance sheets at major financial institutions, which present room for maneuver.To reduce the risks of history repeating itself, the World Bank urged policymakers to coordinate aid for Ukraine, counter the spike in oil and food prices, and set up debt relief for developing economies."
2022-06-08," Among those who became unemployed during the Covid pandemic, 94% say they would consider coming back to work for the right job and pay, the new CNBC All-America Workforce Survey found.Returning the labor force participation rate to where it was before the pandemic is critical for the economy right now as it would alleviate a nationwide worker shortage that threatens higher inflation.The special workforce survey reached 1,200 currently employed people, 450 people who retired during the pandemic and 400 people not in the workforce but also not retired. In a potentially good sign for the economy, the CNBC All-America Workforce Survey finds many Americans who retired or became unemployed during the Covid pandemic would consider coming back to work, but they are looking for the right pay and the right job.The online poll of 2,000 Americans nationwide looked at how the pandemic has changed the work and lives of 1,200 employed Americans and 450 retirees and 400 unemployed workers who left the workforce during the pandemic.It found that 94% of those who say they are unemployed and 68% of retirees would consider a job. The unemployed cite pay and flexible hours and work-life balance as the top criteria for the right job, followed by a job they feel they are qualified for and company benefits.For those who retired during the pandemic, flexible hours are the most important criteria, followed by pay and work-life balance. Most retirees said they would prefer to come back part time. The question of whether those who dropped out would return to work is critical to the outlook for the economy. The labor force participation rate, or the percentage of the population that is available to work, stands at 62.3%, having rebounded from its pandemic lows, but remaining 1.1 percentage points below where it was before the crisis. Returning the participation rate to the prior level would bring another 1.8 million workers into the labor force who could help alleviate a nationwide worker shortage that threatens higher inflation by driving up wages and prices. The survey confirms government data that many retirees accelerated their departure, with 62% of retirees saying they left earlier than planned. In fact, 67% said they left at least two years early. A significant percentage made that call after being laid off. A California woman wrote in: ""I was working part time and my employer laid me off due to pandemic and restructuring. I would have worked part time longer if that option was available.""A New Jersey respondent said: ""During the pandemic, my job changed from partial remote to full time remote. The office I was working at never re-opened during the time I was still employed. I reached full retirement age around the same time that my contract job ended and decided to retire.""Among early retirees, a third said they did so because of health reasons and almost another third because of Covid concerns. About 20% said they just didn't want to work any longer and 12% cited care for a family member.""I was working part-time at a Christian preschool when my husband contracted Covid. He was sick for several months and needed care and they could not hold my job for me, so I had to quit,"" wrote an Ohio retiree.The new poll, part of CNBC's All-America Economic Survey, also showed that unemployment benefits paid during the pandemic had positive and negative effects on workers and the workforce. Among the employed, 55% reported that the benefits allowed them to stay out of work longer than they otherwise would have, and that was true for 50% of both retirees and the currently unemployed. Now, about a third of the unemployed say the benefits allow them to remain out of work.For those currently employed, large percentages said they used the benefits to spend more time finding the right job and paying down their debts. Sixty-nine percent of parents said it helped them pay for child care during the pandemic.Meanwhile, about 40% of those who received benefits say they have some left over, and either saved or invested it, a potential positive sign for consumer spending in the months ahead."

The bloc has been heavily dependent on Russian fossil fuels and cutting some of these supplies overnight will have a significant economic impact. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has become the latest international institution to cut its predictions for global growth this year, but has downplayed the possibility of a prolonged period of so-called stagflation.The OECD estimates that global GDP will hit 3% in 2022 — a 1.5 percentage point downgrade from a projection done in December.""The invasion of Ukraine, along with shutdowns in major cities and ports in China due to the zero-COVID policy, has generated a new set of adverse shocks,"" the Paris-based organization said in its latest economic outlook Wednesday.Russia's invasion of Ukraine is having massive ramifications on the global economy, but China's zero-Covid policy — a strategy Beijing uses to control the virus with strict lockdowns — is also a drag on global growth given the importance of the country in international supply chains and overall consumption.The World Bank said Tuesday that it had also turned more negative on global growth prospects. The institution said global GDP would reach 2.9% this year — an estimate lower from its 4.1% forecast in January.The OECD said in its report Wednesday that the downgrade, in part, ""reflects deep downturns in Russia and Ukraine.""""But growth is set to be considerably weaker than expected in most economies, especially in Europe, where an embargo on oil and coal imports from Russia is incorporated in the projections for 2023,"" it said.

2022-06-09,"Amid high inflation that has become the No. 1 business risk, not a single chief financial officer surveyed by CNBC thinks a recession can be avoided.The macroeconomic view of CFOs informs a bearish stock market outlook, with most expecting the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall to 30,000 before reaching a new high, which would represent a decline of 9% from its current level and an 18% decline from its 2022 high.The CNBC CFO Council Survey is a sample of views from the C-suite at top corporations and organizations, with this quarter's survey including responses from 22 CFOs. Many economic prognosticators and Wall Street stock pickers have made it clear where they stand on inflation and the Federal Reserve policy response: the economy and markets will get worse before they get better. Many chief financial officers at top companies agree with them, according to the results from the latest CNBC CFO Council survey.Over 40% of chief financial officers cite inflation as the No. 1 external risk to their business, and going deeper into the results from the Q2 survey, the links between geopolitics and food and energy prices, and inflation, are clear from the C-suite ranking of the external factors that are weighing on their current outlook. Almost one-quarter (23%) of CFOs cite Federal Reserve policy as the biggest risk factor, and as the Biden administration struggles for ways to increase oil supply and Russian ships sail with seized Ukrainian wheat amid concerns about a severe global food insecurity crisis, additional CFOs cited supply chain disruptions (14%) and the Russia-Ukraine war specifically as their No. 1 business risk.CFOs are not uniformly of the view that the Fed won't ultimately be able to control inflation. A little over half (54%) express confidence in the central bank, but that's still not enough to alter their view of where current economic conditions and policy decisions are heading: into a recession. According to the majority (68%) of CFOs responding to the survey, a recession will occur during the first half of 2023. No CFO forecast a recession any later than the second half of next year, and no CFO thinks the economy will avoid a recession.The CNBC CFO Council Q2 survey is a sample of the current outlook among top financial officers. It was conducted among 22 chief financial officers at major organizations between May 12-June 6.The 10-year Treasury, which has already doubled this year to roughly 3%, is expected to flirt with 4% by the end of 2022, according to 41% of CFOs. An equal percentage of CFOs expect the 10-year to rise to no higher than 3.49% by year-end. But on the margins, there is concern about rates rising even more rapidly, with a few outliers on the Council forecasting a 10-year that rises above 4% by year-end.   Stock picks and investing trends from CNBC Pro:The Fed could enact a 'substitute' interest rate hike at its June meetingBuy this resilient regional bank trading at a 50% discount, Bank of America saysWhat to buy after the Fed stops hiking rates, according to Bank of America The Fed could enact a 'substitute' interest rate hike at its June meetingBuy this resilient regional bank trading at a 50% discount, Bank of America saysWhat to buy after the Fed stops hiking rates, according to Bank of America The European Central Bank on Thursday said it will raise rates for the first time in over a decade as its inflation outlook increased significantly.Growth prospects for the U.S. economy and global economy have dimmed. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow tracker most recent forecast for growth, issued this week, was a negative revision, and indicated the economy could be headed for a second consecutive quarter of negative growth, which meets a classic definition for recession. The World Bank just slashed its global growth outlook, warning that a period of stagflation like the 1970s is possible and with its president David Malpass saying, ""For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid."" The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also cut its prediction for global growth this year.The economic outlook, with elevated inflation and rates rising, is spilling over into the CFO view of the stock market's next leg: it will be lower, according to the survey.The majority (77%) of CFOs expect the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall below 30,000 before ever setting a new high, which would represent a decline of over 9% from its current level, and would represent an 18% decline from its 2022 high. In a market where every bounce may be a ""dead cat,"" more than half (55%) of CFOs say that the current leader will remain in its spot: energy will show the most growth among all sectors of the economy over the next six months. Mohamed El-Erian said anyone fully invested should ""take some chips off the table"" in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" earlier this week.Last Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon issued a warning about the economy and said ""brace yourself.""But one key point-of-view that comes through from CFOs is that many corporations are planning beyond the short-term headwinds. There is a tug-of-war in the survey results between a worsening outlook and indications from many companies that they are not pulling back on spending or hiring. While there have been headlines from the tech sector about conserving cash, slowing or freezing new hires, and even pulling current job offers, companies on the CFO Council are not going into their shells. Twice as many CFOs (36%) say they will increase their spending over the next year than decrease (18%), while almost half (46%) say they will at least maintain current spending levels. And firms are still in hiring mode, with more than half (54%) saying headcount will be increasing over the next 12 months. Only 18% anticipate a decrease in staff.  Correction: The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow tracker most recent forecast for growth, issued this week, was a negative revision, but still anticipates growth of 0.9%. A decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from its current level to 30,000 would represent a decline of 9%. An earlier version of this article misstated these figures."
2022-06-09,"As gasoline nears $5 a gallon, economists say prices would have to go higher and stay elevated to cause a recession.""If we get to $5.50 or $6 that would be consistent with $150 for a barrel of oil. I think then, we're done. We're in for a recession,"" said one economist.The consumer is much better prepared to cope with high gasoline prices than in 2008, the last time there was a big spike, but there are also broader inflationary headwinds from rising food prices and rents. Gasoline is nearing an average $5 per gallon across the U.S., but while consumers are feeling the pain, prices are not yet at a level that would tip the economy into a recession, economists said.Where that breaking point price lies is unclear. Some suggest it would probably not be just gasoline alone that would send the economy into a tailspin. That said, economists say a recession is indeed possible if fuel prices rise to an even higher level and stay there for an extended period of time.According to AAA, the national average for a gallon of unleaded gasoline was $4.97 Thursday, up about 65 cents in just a month.Compounding the pinch at the pump is the fact that other costs are rising as well, with inflation this spring running at an 8.3% pace over last year. Surging natural gas prices are creating higher overall energy prices, while food and rents are also climbing. ""I think we're in a particularly extreme situation right now,"" said Harrison Fell, senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. ""I don't think many economists would argue sustained $5 gas prices would have minimal effects. I think most of us would agree sustained prices that high with no other policy intervention would be a drag on the economy. Whether or not it's sufficient to tip us into a recession is a bit of an unknown factor.""Economists are watching gas prices closely because the pace of the increase has been rapid. Rising fuel prices are noticed by drivers, and the higher cost of gas can impact consumer sentiment and inflation expectations.Economists note, though, that rising wages and a strong job market are working as insulation against the higher prices. Unlike 2008, when gasoline soared and the economy fell into a recession, consumers are in much better shape.""While there's clearly a shock, and there's a strain on consumer budgets, the good news is there is support from the healthy labor market and the amount of excess savings that are still outstanding. In 2008, there was zero savings,"" said Michelle Meyer, Mastercard's chief economist, U.S.Household balance sheets were weak in 2008, and consumers were heavily in debt. ""There was minimal savings. ... It was much harder to absorb price shocks,"" Meyer said.According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures overall retail sales across all payment types, nominal spending at gasoline stations in recent months has increased at a trend pace of about 30%, compared with the same time in 2019.Meyer points out that even though gas prices jumped in the last two months, the nominal spending growth remained steady. She said that suggests consumers have cut back on how much gasoline they are buying as they spent the same amount.""There's been some pullback in real consumption or usage. That means consumers are trying to make a decision, trying to figure out how to balance their spending priorities,"" she said.Another big difference between now and 2008 is that vehicles are more fuel efficient and there are more hybrid and electric vehicles on the road. There is also more flexibility in commuting with more people working remotely or in the office on a part-time basis.""For the average person out there, it feels very different, depending on how exposed they are to gas prices,"" Meyer said.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the economy is holding on, but there have been some signs of gasoline prices creating a drag. For instance, some automakers reported sharp sales declines in May, a month where gasoline prices rose quickly. The declines were particularly noticeable in large sports utility vehicle sales.""That would suggest gas is playing a role. It felt demand side driven, not supply side driven. Of all the economic indicators out there, that's the one that makes me most nervous about what's going on,"" he said.Economists are watching consumer trends closely for behavioral changes. Lately, credit card use has also been rising, and consumers are taking on more debt. ""It feels like lower and middle income households are starting to borrow,"" Zandi said.So far, Zandi does not see gasoline at a point where it is sapping the economy's ability to grow, and he does not expect a recession this year.""I don't think we're there yet. If we get to $5.50 or $6, that would be consistent with $150 for a barrel of oil. I think then, we're done. We're in for a recession,"" he said. ""It would be too much to bear. I think we could digest $120 if we don't stay there too long.""He said he expects oil could top out near current levels, and be below $100 per barrel by this time next year, relieving pressure on gasoline prices.""The economy is definitely on thin ice here. We need a little luck on oil prices,"" he said. Zandi said he sees a one-in-three chance of a recession over the next 12 months, and almost even odds for a recession in the next 24 months.Skyrocketing gasoline prices come as many Americans are choosing to spend on things such as travel and entertainment. That determination to return to normal activities could be keeping gasoline demand higher than it might otherwise have been as prices rose.""Savings were pretty good coming out of the pandemic. I think people were in a better position to weather those higher gas prices right now. Together with this pent-up demand for travel, it's shielding us from this $5 gas price,"" Fell said.Also, gasoline prices, while at a record, are not at the levels reached in 2008, when measured in wage adjusted terms.Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, said she estimates gasoline will average $4.84 per gallon for the month of June. To make that equal to 2008 levels, based on a wage adjusted basis, prices would have to reach $6.41 per gallon, House said.""It's going to take more than just higher gasoline prices to knock the economy into a recession,"" said House. ""We're slowing, but it's still a remarkable number of jobs we're putting up.""The one caveat she noted was that consumers are contending with some of the fastest growing inflation in decades, and gasoline just adds to that burden.""It's one more straw on the camel's back,"" she said, nothing that makes it easier for an unexpected shock to knock the economy off course. Because of uncertainty about how high energy prices can go, House does not believe inflation has peaked, unlike some economists.How high can gas prices go?Oil prices reached a high of about $130 per barrel in March after Russia invaded Ukraine but then fell off again. Crude has been on the rise again and could go higher on further European sanctions on Russian oil and as China's economy reopens after recent Covid shutdowns. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were just under $122 per barrel on Thursday.Gasoline prices move higher with oil, but there is also less supply than normal in part because of a reduction in global refining. In the U.S. alone, refining capacity is down 1 million barrels a day from prepandemic levels due to outages and shutdowns.JPMorgan analysts expect gasoline could top out at a price of $6.20 per gallon by August, but other analysts expect the peak price to stay closer to $5.25 per gallon because drivers will likely cut back.Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at Gas Buddy, said driving demand was down from last year over the Memorial Day weekend, the start of summer driving season.The Energy Information Administration reported drivers used 8.98 million barrels a day of gasoline in the week heading into the holiday weekend. Last year, that level was 9.2 million barrels a day. In 2019 drivers used 9.4 million barrels a day in the comparable period. DeHaan said he expects the run-up in gasoline prices is nearly at a peak, but all bets are off if there's any disruption in supply.""If we get a hurricane, if there's a refinery kink, we're going up to $5.50 or maybe $6. Normally a peak is a lot more predictive than it is this year,"" he said. "
2022-06-09,"Bosses of major fintech players sounded the alarm about deteriorating macroeconomic conditions at the Money 20/20 Europe trade show.John Collison, co-founder of online payments firm Stripe, said he was unsure if the company could still justify its $95 billion valuation given the current economic climate.Zopa, a digital bank based in Britain, suggested it was less likely to meet its target of going public by the end of 2022. AMSTERDAM — Financial technology companies are putting IPO plans on hold and cutting expenses as fears of an impending recession cause a shift in how investors view the market.At the Money 20/20 conference in Amsterdam, bosses of major fintech players sounded the alarm about the impact of a deteriorating macroeconomic climate on fundraising and valuations.John Collison, co-founder and president of Stripe, said he was unsure if the company could justify its $95 billion valuation given the current economic environment.""The honest answer is, I don't know,"" Collison said on stage Tuesday. Stripe raised venture capital funding last year and is not currently looking to raise again, he added.""If you look at our fundamentals, we grew 60% last year,"" Collison said. ""You have to weigh the two different factors against each other.""It comes as buy now, pay later firm Klarna is reportedly looking to raise fresh funds at a 30% discount to its $46 billion valuation, while rival group Affirm has lost roughly two thirds of its stock market value since the start of 2022. Zopa, a digital bank based in Britain, had hoped to go public by the end of 2022. But this is looking less likely as inflation shocks exacerbated by the war in Ukraine have led to a slump in both public and private markets. ""The markets have to be there"" for Zopa to go public, CEO Jaidev Janardana told CNBC. ""The markets are not there — not for fin, not for tech.""""We will just have to wait for when the markets are in the right place,"" he added. ""You only want to do an IPO once, so we want to make sure that we pick the right moment.""The tech sector has borne the brunt of a market sell-off since the start of the year, as investors digested the likelihood of a steep rate hiking cycle — which makes growth stocks' future earnings less attractive.Several executives and investors said rising inflation and interest rate hikes were making it harder for fintech firms to raise money.""Within the investment community, the mood is very grim,"" Iana Dimitrova, CEO of payment software firm OpenPayd, told CNBC.OpenPayd is in the process of raising funds, but it's unclear when the company will be able to finalize the round, Dimitrova said. ""People are now definitely moving much slower than they did a year ago,"" she said. ""They're being more cautious."" Prajit Nanu, co-founder and CEO of San Francisco-based payments company Nium, said he's expecting ""massive consolidation"" in fintech.""Companies which are not going to raise are going to either get consolidated or shut down,"" he said.The big fear is that fintech growth will slow along with the economy at large as soaring prices force consumers to tighten their purse string. Economists at the World Bank on Tuesday cut their forecast for global economic growth, warning of prolonged ""stagflation"" — a situation where inflation remains high but growth stalls. Investment in the fintech sector boomed last year, reaching a record $132 billion globally — thanks in large part to the effects of Covid lockdowns on people's shopping habits. But — as worries around rising inflation and higher interest rates hit home — funding dropped 18% in the first quarter from the previous three months to $28.8 billion, according to data from CB Insights.""There's going to be more of a focus on unit economics versus just crazy growth,"" Ricardo Schaefer, partner at Target Global and an early investor in financial services app Revolut, told CNBC.Stripe's Collison had a simple piece of advice for fintech founders at the conference: tear up the 2021 investor pitch.""They definitely can't do the 2021 pitch,"" he said. ""It needs to be a new pitch, a 2022 pitch.""Ken Serdons, chief commercial officer of Dutch payments firm Mollie, agreed. Fintechs seeking fresh funds now will need to present a ""clear path to profitability,"" he said."
2022-06-10,"The Federal Reserve's two-day meeting is the highlight of the week ahead, and the next catalyst for markets will be what clues it gives about future rate hikes.The Fed is widely expected to raise the fed funds rate by a half point Wednesday and again next month, but Friday's very hot consumer inflation report sparked expectations policymakers could hike faster and higher.Markets are fearful of a recession, so stock investors are watching the bond market, which is sending fresh signals that the economy could be weakening. The week ahead may all come down to what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has to say at 2:30 p.m. ET Wednesday.Powell briefs the press following the central bank's two-day meeting. The Fed is widely expected to raise its fed funds target rate range by a half percentage point, but hot May inflation data has made markets nervous about whether policymakers could be even more aggressive or forecast a faster pace of future rate hikes.The Fed will release new economic and interest rate forecasts at 2 p.m. But it's whatever Powell says about summer and autumn rate hikes that could help set the course for turbulent financial markets. Stocks and bonds have been volatile on investor fears that inflation may not be peaking, and that the rate hikes could cause a recession. ""I think really, the key thing is what Powell talks about in the conference and does he give anything that sounds like firm guidance for September,"" said Michael Schumacher, head of macro strategy at Wells Fargo. ""If he does, he would only do it if he was going to be hawkish, and if he doesn't, people will view it as dovish.""Schumacher said the fed funds futures market was reflecting a 56 basis point hike for Wednesday. A basis point equals 0.01%.After Friday's much hotter-than-expected consumer price index for May, stocks cratered. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 5.1%. The index closed Friday at 3,900, off 2.9%. Loading chart... ""The market wants some clear and convincing evidence that the Fed can pull this off without starting a recession,"" said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. She said the market will take its cues from the economic data. ""Maybe you're stuck in purgatory for awhile.""Friday's inflation report was a negative catalyst for markets that were already pricing in worries about hot inflation and recession fears. CPI rose 8.6% year over year, well above the 8.3% expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. That also added fuel to the debate about whether the Fed will consider a 75 basis point rate hike and continue at a more aggressive pace. Both Barclays and Jefferies changed their forecasts Friday to include a 75 basis point hike for Wednesday, though other economists still expect a half point.Goldman Sachs economists Friday revised their forecast to include a half-point increase in September, on top of a half-point hike Wednesday and another in July.JP Morgan economists expect Fed officials will provide new interest rate forecasts that reflect a faster pace of policy tightening, but they still see a half-point increase Wednesday. They expect the Fed's median forecast for interest rates will show the fed funds rate at 2.625% at year-end, well above a forecast of 1.875% in March.

She said she was encouraged that some Fed officials seem ready to raise rates more rapidly earlier in the year, and leave themselves flexibility later on.""I think the markets like that. It shows they're not on autopilot,"" she said. ""It reflects that they don't want to do too much damage to the economy. I would like to hear more commentary around that flexibility.""Besides the Fed, there are a few important economic reports on the calendar next week, including the producer price index on Tuesday; retail sales Wednesday; housing starts Thursday, and industrial production Friday. All four reports cover May.There are just a handful of corporate earnings, including Oracle on Monday.Recession warning?In the bond market, Treasury yields rose after the hotter inflation report but the yield curve also flattened. That means shorter duration yields, like the 2-year, rose closer to longer duration yields, like the 10-year.On Friday, the 2-year Treasury yield reached 3.06%, and the spread was only 10 basis points. If the 2-year were to move above the 10-year yield, the curve would be inverted, which is a recession signal. Loading chart... Calvasina said the stock market, for now, is pricing in only a shallow recession. The S&P 500 has declined an average 32% in more traditional recessions, and in this cycle it has been down nearly 20%.The strategist said there's a 60% chance the market has already set a bottom.

2022-06-10,"The CBR said in a statement that ""inflation is slowing faster and the decline in economic activity is of a smaller magnitude"" than the central bank expected in April. The Central Bank of Russia on Friday cut its key interest rate by 150 basis points to 9.5% — the level it was at when Russia's invasion of Ukraine began.Although acknowledging that the external environment for the Russian economy remains ""challenging and significantly restrains economic activity,"" the central bank's board said in a statement that ""inflation is slowing faster and the decline in economic activity is of a smaller magnitude"" than it expected in April.""Recent data suggest that price growth rates in May and early June have been low. This comes as a result of ruble exchange rate movements and the tailing-off of the surge in consumer demand in the context of a marked decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses,"" the CBR said.It marks the fourth rate cut since an emergency hike from 9.5% to 20% in late February, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It was last reduced from 14% to 11% at an extraordinary meeting in late May.Russian inflation slowed to an annual 17.1% in May from 17.83% in April, which was its highest level since January 2002, indicating that the immediate inflationary shock from the war in Ukraine and resulting international sanctions may have peaked.Meanwhile, the ruble survived a plunge to historic lows against the dollar following the invasion to become the world's best-performing fiat currency, though economists are skeptical about the sustainability of the rally.The currency jumped by around 4% against the dollar following Friday's decision. The ruble was trading just over 57 to the dollar at midday London time. Loading chart... The CBR said it will continue to take into account inflation dynamics and the ""economic transformation process"" implemented in an effort to mitigate the long-term damage from Western sanctions.Policymakers now expect annual inflation in Russia to come in between 14.0–17.0% in 2022, fall to 5.0–7.0% in 2023 before returning to 4% in 2024.""Overall, the actual decrease in economic activity in 2022 Q2 is less pronounced than the Bank of Russia assumed in its April baseline scenario. Given the above, the Bank of Russia estimates that the 2022 GDP decline could be lower than forecast in April,"" the CBR said.The bank's next rate decision meeting will take place on July 22."
2022-06-10,"Gold prices bounced back in volatile trading on Friday, as focus turned to economic risks after elevated U.S. inflation readings bolstered bets for aggressive interest rate hikes.Spot gold rose 1.4% to $1,873.58 per ounce by 2:40 p.m. EDT.U.S. gold futures settled up 1.2% at $1,875.50.U.S. consumer prices accelerated in May, suggesting the Federal Reserve could continue with its 50 basis points rate hikes through September, sending gold to its lowest since May 19 at $1,824.63.But the safe-haven asset soon erased losses as investors assessed the economic repercussions, with bullion getting a further fillip after the University of Michigan's survey showed U.S. consumer sentiment plunged to a record low in early June amid soaring gasoline prices.""Gold has had a manic roller coaster ride, dropping to lows of the month before rallying sharply on the CPI report and bouncing back again on the worst consumer sentiment report on record,"" said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader in New York.High interest rates usually dim bullion's appeal since they translate to an increased opportunity cost of holding the asset, which pays no interest.Gold's fate next week may hinge on the Fed meeting, Wong added.Gold's rebound also came despite strength in the dollar, and elevated U.S. Treasury yields.Gold prices have been ""remarkably resilient given (rate) hiking expectations, and a softening physical market"" on concerns that inflation may outpace rate hikes, said Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper.Physical gold discounts in India this week hit seven-week highs, while COVID-19 curbs dissuaded buyers in China.

Automaker Hyundai Motor has cut production at some lines and cement makers have also cut operations.Prolonged labor strife could test President Yoon Suk-yeol, a political novice who took office five weeks ago, potentially distracting from his conservative agenda and raising the risk of long-term antagonism with powerful unions.   The government has urged the truckers to return to work but said it would seek to reflect their demands in the legislative process and keep trying to end the strife through dialogue.The truckers demand an extension of subsidies, set to expire this year, that guarantee minimum wages as fuel prices rise. The government says it is up to parliament to change the legislation.As the global economy struggles with supply bottlenecks, any prolonged slowdown in the production and shipments of chips, petrochemicals and autos could add to concerns of rising inflation and slowing growth.South Korea's inflation is set to hit a 24-year high of 4.8% this year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last week, while cutting its growth forecast to 2.7% from a December projection of 3.0%.

2022-06-13,"Let's be clear about one thing: markets aren't in turmoil because the Fed might hike 75 basis points this week. They're in turmoil because inflation is really bad, and no one has yet stepped up to declare--like Mario Draghi of Europe did when their debt crisis was reaching a climax--that the central bank will do ""whatever it takes"" to fix the problem.  Of course the Fed wants to ""balance"" the inflation fight against the risks of sending the economy into recession. Unfortunately, inflation is proving just as damaging to Americans. Consumer sentiment just plunged to a record low in the University of Michigan's 75-year series history. It's worse now, in other words, than at any point in any prior recession since 1952. Is this what success is supposed to look like?  It's not. It's a clear failure. And worse, there's no relief in sight. Even if Russia ends the war on Ukraine and its energy supplies return to the global market, the world is under-supplied in oil right now. Global demand is higher than supply, even including Russian barrels. The unexpectedly sharp rebound in demand has tightened markets of all types to the point of breaking, and it was global stimulus that juiced us to this point, before pandemic-hit supply chains were ready to handle it.  Now, no one can keep up with demand because we literally don't have enough workers, and the resulting wage pressures are spreading inflation throughout every aspect of the economy. The global stimulus created a curious problem: too many jobs all at once. There just aren't enough available workers to fill all the jobs employers need filled right now. The market is quickly trying to find a clearing point through (a) resetting pay higher, and (b) destroying ""phantom"" job openings like those in stimulus-juiced industries (crypto, anyone?) that were more or less a mirage.  The Fed at best can get out of the way and not counteract this process right now. By pivoting to rate hikes and balance sheet shrinkage, it is at least slowing the amount of stimulus it's adding to the economy--stimulus that would worsen these problems. The fact that so much of the economy's ""nominal"" growth is being eaten up by inflation right now is plain evidence that policy overshot. The U.S. should be growing around 4-5% a year nominally, or 2-3% in real terms after inflation. Instead, we exploded to almost 10% nominal growth last year, and each quarter we have less ""real"" growth leftover to show for it, because it's all going into inflation. And--the Fed is still running expansionary policy! Don't be fooled by the rate hikes and ""quantitative tightening."" If the ""neutral"" level of interest rates is at least 2.5% right now (and it's probably higher, because inflation is so high), then any rate below that level is stimulative. They could hike 75 basis points this week and that only puts them in the 1.5% to 1.75% range--still way below neutral, let alone ""tight"" monetary policy.  And yes, the balance sheet reduction also counts towards that goal, but it's not clear by how much. One recent paper suggests $2 trillion in reduction over 3 years is only equal to about 30 basis points of rate hikes; 90 basis points if markets are extremely risk averse. Put differently, QT raises the odds of a financial markets ""accident"" and is necessary to avoid leaving too much inflationary dry powder in the economy, but doesn't equal much in terms of tightening policy.  This is why interest rates are once again spiking higher, especially since the super-high CPI report last Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield nearly hit 3.3% this morning; that means the 30-year fixed mortgage rate will probably cross above 6% by this afternoon. The market isn't just trying to figure out the odds of a 75-basis-point rate hike this week, but calculating just how much more the Fed needs to do against how much it is willing to do right now, and how much worse inflation will be for how many more months as a result.  Would markets freak out if Fed Chair Powell came to the podium on Wednesday and said, bluntly, the Fed will do ""whatever it takes"" to bring inflation back down quickly to their 2% target? After all, markets are already freaking out! The Dow just had its worst losing streak in almost a century. The dollar is soaring, which is never good. The S&P reentered a bear market with the renewed selling pressure this morning. What's worse, for us to linger here for months with continued macro uncertainty, feeling like we're in a recession anyhow? Or to have the Fed move more quickly to truly tighten policy, and give markets some much-needed clarity on the preeminence of their inflation-fighting goal? Congress may have given them a ""dual mandate"" on price stability and full employment, but it forgot the lesson from Scripture; ""man cannot serve two masters."" And no one else but the Fed can truly fix the inflation problem, as we have had to keep learning over the years.  See you at 1 p.m! KellyTwitter: @KellyCNBCInstagram: @realkellyevans"
2022-06-13,"Stocks may go into a deeper tailspin.Canaccord Genuity's Tony Dwyer predicts 1980s-era interest rate hikes will exacerbate the turmoil and make a recession seem increasingly more likely.""Typically, I've been bullish over the years. But there's a money availability problem,"" the firm's chief market strategist told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Monday. ""Ultimately, you have to have money to buy stuff, to do stuff and to invest in stuff. And, the avenues for money availability have largely closed down since the beginning of the year.""In a note out this week, Dwyer warns the Federal Reserve is ""under significant pressure"" to cut inflation by clamping down on demand. He contends the economy is on the cusp of rate spikes reminiscent of Paul Volcker's tenure as Fed chair.""Debt-to-GDP in the Volcker era was at a generational low,"" said Dwyer. ""So, debt to GDP wasn't anywhere near the issue it is today. We're at generational high at 138% debt to-GDP. So, if you're going to take a levered economy and shut it down, that's not good.""On Monday, the S&P 500 lost 4% and closed in bear market territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 5% and the Dow dropped 876 points, its first time ever closing own 600-plus points three days in a row. The pain on Wall Street coincided with a jump in the benchmark 10-year Treasury Note yield. The move comes a day ahead of the Fed's policy meeting on interest rates.""We've taken limited money availability, bloated inventories because of the supply chain constraints, cratered CEO and consumer confidence into a lower demand environment in a levered system,"" said Dwyer."" ""Upside in the market, upside in the economy or upside in anything has to come with more money.""According to Dwyer, the market won't reach ""the"" bottom until the central bank abandons its tightening policies.""The Fed has to signal a turn,"" he said.Disclaimer"

""We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom,"" Armstrong says. ""While it's hard to predict the economy or the markets, we always plan for the worst so we can operate the business through any environment."" Coinbase is laying off almost a fifth of its workforce amid a collapse in its stock and crypto prices.The cryptocurrency exchange will cut 18% of full-time jobs, according to an email sent to employees Tuesday morning. Coinbase has roughly 5,000 full-time workers, translating to a head count reduction of around 1,100 people.Shares of Coinbase closed down .83%.CEO Brian Armstrong pointed to a possible recession, and a need to manage Coinbase's burn rate and increase efficiency. He also said the company grew ""too quickly"" during a bull market.""We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,"" Armstrong said in the email, adding that past crypto winters have resulted in a significant decline in trading activity. ""While it's hard to predict the economy or the markets, we always plan for the worst so we can operate the business through any environment."" Coinbase had initially said it was pausing hiring. Two weeks later, the crypto giant announced that it was extending the freeze for the ""foreseeable future."" Earlier this year, Coinbase said it planned to add 2,000 jobs across product, engineering and design.""Our employee costs are too high to effectively manage this uncertain market,"" Armstrong said. ""While we tried our best to get this just right, in this case it is now clear to me that we over-hired.""The news comes during a deep rout for Coinbase shares. The stock went public via a direct listing last April during a boom in crypto markets and investors clamoring for high-growth tech stocks. Coinbase's shares are down 79% this year and 85% from the all-time high. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped to near $22,000 and has lost 53% of its value this year. San Francisco-based Coinbase reported a slump in users in its last quarter and a 27% decline in revenue from a year ago. The company gets the majority of its top line from transaction fees, which are closely tied to trading activity.President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi called it a ""very difficult decision for Coinbase"" but given the economic backdrop, she said it ""felt like the most prudent thing to do right now.""Affected employees received a notification from human resources. If so, the memo was sent to a personal email as Coinbase cut off access to the company systems. Armstrong called it the ""only practical choice"" given the number of employees with access to customer information, and a way to ""ensure not even a single person made a rash decision that harmed the business or themselves."" Coinbase employees will have access to a talent hub to find new jobs in the industry, including Coinbase Ventures' portfolio companies. Choi said Coinbase would still be ""doubling down"" on areas like security and compliance and may be ""reorienting"" employees to near-term revenue drivers.""If there are any cuts to new product areas, it's going to be more around experimental venture areas that we're still very bullish on, but that we don't want to invest in in this part of the cycle,"" Choi told CNBC in an interview at the company's headquarters.""We will continue to invest in incredible innovative areas of crypto that we think are emerging over the longer term, but we're probably going to do those in a more measured way in this type of an environment.""

The company has lived through multiple bear markets in crypto before, also known as ""crypto winters.""""We will power through any macro environment, any crypto winter, or anything that's coming,"" she said. ""The reality though, is that we have to adjust when we feel that there's a very dynamic economic environment in play.""Tech companies have been fighting low morale and attrition as their stocks get slammed. Last week, a petition posted to a decentralized publishing platform called for the removal and a ""vote of no confidence"" regarding several Coinbase executives, including Choi.Armstrong called attention to the since-deleted petition, and in a Tweet urged employees to quit if they don't believe in the company.""We will always encourage our employees to share feedback internally on how we operate as a company — and we have a number of mechanisms in place for them to do so. It's very much unclear if this document came from within the company,"" Choi said. ""However, if it did, we're disappointed that those behind it felt the need to breach the trust of the company and their co-workers by sharing this information in a way clearly designed to drive controversy rather than a meaningful dialogue."" Coinbase has no plans to offer additional company equity grants, or cash compensation amid the price drop, Choi said. The company offers annual grants, partially so employees could ""mitigate the swings"" and volatility in crypto. For employees and investors, the COO likened it to Amazon or Tesla: a long-term investment with volatility in the meantime.""We think that anyone who makes an investment, whether they're an employee or investor, will have a handsome return over the longer term,"" Choi said. ""Coinbase is a long-term play  — we have very deep conviction in the long-term value of the stock."""
2022-06-14,"The prospect that the Fed and other central banks will be forced to hike interest rates more aggressively has reignited fears of a global recession.Investors are awaiting a landmark monetary policy announcement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, with bets on a 75 basis point interest rate hike rising.""What we're currently seeing is central banks somehow starting to panic ... therefore we have this big stock market correction, I think rightly so,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING.  Global stock markets diverged on Tuesday after a worldwide sell-off in the previous session, as analysts assessed the longevity of the bear market and risk of recession.U.S. stock futures bounced in early premarket trade on Tuesday after the S&P 500 slid back into bear market territory the day before. related investing newsOur conviction in Morgan Stanley remains solid, despite the CEO's planned departure Kevin Stankiewicz21 hours agoInvestors are awaiting a landmark monetary policy announcement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, with bets on a 75 basis point interest rate hike rising in light of a shock 8.6% annual inflation print for May.The prospect that the Fed and other central banks will be forced to hike interest rates more aggressively in order to rein in inflation — at a time when growth is slowing across most major economies — has reignited fears of a global recession. Guy Stear, head of EM and credit research at Societe Generale, told CNBC on Tuesday that while a recession was looking more likely, there were two prongs to consider. ""One is the pure economic outlook, and secondly the profit outlook. I would actually be more worried about profits than I would about economic growth itself,"" Stear said. He said that the more-than 25-year trend of profit rising as a percentage of GDP was ""more or less finished,"" given the ongoing themes of deglobalization, higher energy and input costs, and higher wages.""So I think that no matter what happens in terms of the economic outlook – and yes, the likelihood of an economic recession is mounting – the likelihood of a profit recession is mounting a lot faster."" As well as the Fed, the Bank of England, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank are all set to announce monetary policy decisions this week. Each is facing its own set of economic challenges, along with the global problems of soaring food and energy costs, and supply chain disruptions.""What we're currently seeing is central banks somehow starting to panic, markets clearly facing all of a sudden this new era of higher interest rates, therefore we have this big stock market correction, I think rightly so,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. ""With central banks now tightening monetary policy, somehow panicking, the likelihood of a recession in the U.S., but also in the euro zone towards the end of the year, has clearly increased."" Wall Street's overnight losses bled into markets in Asia-Pacific on Tuesday, with major bourses largely declining and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 plunging more than 3.5% on its return to trade following a public holiday. European markets were choppy on Tuesday as the Stoxx 600 index jumped to a 1% gain at the start of trading, before sliding back to the flatline around an hour later. In terms of positioning in response to the current pullback, Soc Gen's Stear suggested that several defensive areas of the corporate credit market could offer some protection for investors.""My personal view in terms of where we are on the bear market is we're about three-fifths of the way through it in credit markets, so I'm waiting for another 80 basis point widening in terms of credit, which means losses of probably not double digits, but close to, in the equity markets before I really start to get interested in terms of valuations,"" he said.In particular, Stear identified energy and utilities, the latter of which he argued represents a necessity in the move towards clean energy and the green transition. However, he also remains positive on the banking sector.""I think banks have deleveraged so much in the past 10 years that they're a lot less sensitive to the economic variations, particularly in Europe, than they would have been 10, 15, 20 years ago, so I think that's more of a defensive sector than people realize,"" Stear said."
2022-06-14,"The producer price index rose 0.8% for the month and 10.8% over the past year. The monthly gain was in line with estimates and the annual gain was slightly off the record 11.5% hit earlier this year.The data is significant in that prices at the wholesale level feed through to consumer prices. Wholesale prices rose at a brisk pace in May as inflation pressures mounted on the U.S. economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.The producer price index, a measure of the prices paid to producers of goods and services, rose 0.8% for the month and 10.8% over the past year. The monthly rise was in line with Dow Jones estimates and a doubling of the 0.4% pace in April.Excluding food, energy and trade, so-called core PPI rose 0.5% on the month, slightly below the 0.6% estimate but an increase from the 0.4% reading in the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, the core measure was up 6.8%, matching April's gain.The two PPI measures remained near their historic highs — 11.5% for headline, and 7.1% for core, both hit in March.The data is significant in that prices at the wholesale level feed through to consumer prices, which are running at their highest levels since December 1981. The consumer price index increased 8.6% annually in May, defying hopes that inflation had peaked in the spring.Federal Reserve officials are watching the inflation numbers closely. Markets now expect the central bank to raise benchmark short-term borrowing rates by 75 basis points when their two-day meeting concludes Wednesday.For wholesale prices, energy made up much of the May gains. The index for final demand energy rose 5% on the month, part of a 1.4% surge in final demand goods. The goods-services imbalance has been at the core of the inflation pressures, as consumer demand has shifted strongly in an economy that generally is more dependent on services.Within that energy gain, gasoline rose 8.4%, while multiple other fuel categories pushed higher as well.The services index advanced 0.4%, with transportation and warehousing services responsible for more than half the gain. The increases were softened by declines in fuels and lubricants, portfolio management and guest room rentals.Stock market futures pointed to a rebound following the release. Government bond yields pulled back after massive gains Monday, with the benchmark 10-year note most recently yielding about 3.32%."
2022-06-15,"Shanghai has been dubbed the most expensive place in the world to be rich, according to a new report, which shows that even the uber-wealthy aren't immune to inflationary pressures on their most prized luxury goods.The Chinese megacity took the title for the second year running after recording major price increases across 16 out of 20 luxury items, Julius Baer's Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2022 showed Wednesday.It was one of four Asia-Pacific cities, including Taipei (3rd), Hong Kong (4th) and Singapore (5th) to round out the top five most expensive locations for high- and ultra-high net worth individuals.London (2nd) was the only European outlier in the top five. The U.K. capital shot up six places this year amid rising residential property and hospitality prices.By comparison, no city in the Americas ranked in the top 10. Indeed, they emerged as ""relatively cheap"" for the uber-wealthy, according to the report's authors. Swiss private bank Julius Baer's annual ranking is based on the price of a basket of luxury goods representing discretionary purchases by HNWIs — individuals with $1 million or more in investible assets — across the 25 global cities.The report found that the enduring effects of the coronavirus pandemic combined with challenging macro-economic conditions and supply chain disruptions led to price rises across the majority of the 20 items studied.Inflation across the collection of items rose 7.5% over the year, compared with just 1% the year earlier.The data was gathered between November 2021 and April 2022, capturing some, but not all, of the economic stressors inflicted by the war in Ukraine. Three-quarters (75%) of luxury goods and almost two-thirds (63%) of luxury services increased in price over the year, according to the report. That was due to services being somewhat more restricted during the tail-end of lockdowns, delaying an uptick in demand.Technology packages — which include an iPhone, iPad and MacBook — and lawyers recorded the greatest global price increases over the year, at 41% and 32.6% respectively. The report's authors said that was a result of increased demand, supply chain constraints and a ""continued search for high-quality talent"" in professional services. ""Nobody's immune to inflation,"" Alan Hooks, head of private clients at Julius Baer, said at an event to mark the report's launch Wednesday. He added, however, that HNWIs have a better ""ability to absorb inflationary pressures"" than many people.""Clearly, this represents what we're seeing in the broader economy,"" Dawn Li Wan Po, executive director and senior portfolio manager at Julius Baer, added.Inflation has been on a continued upward trajectory over recent months, raising the cost of goods and services and prompting a cost-of-living crisis in broader society.Contrastingly, the report found that wine and health insurance recorded the greatest price falls globally this year, falling 26.1% and 24.4% respectively. The report's authors said the reduced health insurance costs were a result of the rebalancing of prices following pandemic highs. Still, staggeringly high luxury real estate and car prices — which account for a larger weighting in the report's index — were the main contributors to Shanghai's continued stronghold, rising 28% and 11% respectively from an already high base.In second place London, it was again residential property prices, which rank 103% above the global average, and hotel rooms (162% above average), which accounted for the rapid rise from eighth place in 2021.Tokyo, meanwhile, saw the greatest price falls over the year, dropping from the second most expensive city to the eighth, largely due to currency depreciation in the Japanese yen.For the first time this year, the report also included a lifestyle survey, which asked the world's wealthy about their consumption, spending and investment habits.It found that wealthy people in Asia-Pacific were the most optimistic about their business and financial conditions compared to those in other regions.HNWIs in Europe said they intend to spend more this year on leisure, while those in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and the Americas said they would spend more on health insurance."
2022-06-15,"Some economists argue that recessions have become an inevitable part of the economic cycle that fluctuates between periods of expansion and contraction.The Federal Reserve has attempted to avoid a recession by engineering what's known as a ""soft landing,"" but successfully pulling it off is extremely rare.Policies often have a clear limitation on what they can achieve against an impending downturn. The U.S. has experienced at least 30 recessions throughout history, dating back as early as 1857.Some economists argue that they may have become an inevitable part of the financial cycle that fluctuates between periods of expansion and contraction.""History teaches us that recessions are inevitable,"" said David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at The Brookings Institution. ""I think there are things we can do with a policy that makes recessions less likely or when they occur, less severe. We've learned a lot, but we haven't learned enough to say that we're never going to have another recession.""As the nation's authority on monetary policies, the Federal Reserve plays a critical role in managing recessions.The Fed is currently attempting to avoid a recession by engineering what's known as a ""soft landing,"" in which incremental interest rate hikes are used to curb inflation without pushing the economy into recession.""What they're trying to do is raise rates enough so demand slows,"" said Jason Snipe, chief investment officer at Odyssey Capital Advisors.But a successful soft landing is extremely rare as the monetary policy needed to slow down the economy is often enforced too late to make any meaningful impact.It was arguably achieved just once, in 1994, thanks to the Fed's more proactive response to inflation and good timing.""[It's] really, really difficult to get into that really, really narrow zone,"" said Stephen Miran, former senior advisor at the U.S. Department of Treasury. ""It's the difference between trying to land an airplane in a really wide and spacious open field versus trying to land an airplane on a very, very narrow piece of land with rocks and water on either side.""Some experts also argue that policies have a limitation on what they can achieve against an impending downturn.""Policy tends to operate with long lags, which means the ability to effect immediate change in the economy is quite slow. I also think that increasingly we live in a global economy where the cross-currents that are impacting the economic dynamics are very complex,"" said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer, wealth management at Morgan Stanley.""These are dynamics that the Fed doesn't have the tools to address and so to a certain extent, we do think that policymakers have certainly developed more tools to fight recessions,"" she said.

2022-06-15,"Inflation risk is most acute for retirees and near-retirees who live on fixed incomes, according to financial experts speaking at CNBC's Financial Advisor Summit.They may have a tougher time adjusting to higher consumer prices than workers, who continue to get paychecks.Seniors largely live off income from investments and guaranteed sources such as Social Security or pensions. Stocks and bonds are down this year, inflation is eroding cash, and some income streams may get paltry cost-of-living adjustments. Retirees and those planning to retire soon are the people most threatened by high inflation, investment managers and financial experts said at CNBC's Financial Advisor Summit.Inflation means a dollar today can buy fewer groceries and other household staples than it did a year ago, on average.Some inflation is expected in a healthy economy. But prices for consumer goods and services are rising at their fastest pace in 40 years. The torrid pace over the last several months has eroded household purchasing power more quickly than usual, which has been especially challenging for those living on fixed incomes.

Their wages grew 6.1% over the past year — the fastest annual pace in at least 25 years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. (Their data dates to 1997.)The job market has been hot, pushing businesses to raise pay. Though the average worker's wages haven't kept pace with inflation (which was 8.6% in the year through May), some have come out ahead. But many retirees are no longer getting a paycheck — they're living on income from their investments (in 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts, for example) and regular checks from sources such as Social Security, pensions and annuities.  Relative to investments, retirees with ample cash are seeing the value of that stockpile decline faster than usual due to inflation and paltry interest rates — which means they must withdraw more cash to fund their usual expenses.Meanwhile, stocks and bonds are both down significantly this year. The S&P 500 Index entered a ""bear market"" this week for the first time since March 2020. The dynamic makes it challenging for retirees (especially new retirees) to fund their lifestyle using their investment portfolio without risking a financial shortfall later. Relative to guaranteed income, Social Security offers an annual cost of living adjustment. Recipients got a 5.9% boost to benefits this year, which was the largest in about 40 years but still lags May's inflation reading; next year's adjustment may be even higher.  But most pensions don't adjust beneficiaries' income upwards. Those that do generally raise benefits by 2% to 3% each year — less than half the current pace of inflation. Further, Americans are generally living longer lives, which means their money must stretch over more time in retirement.Therefore, many retirees should have at least some stock exposure in their investment portfolios, since stocks have more long-term growth potential than assets such as bonds and cash, according to financial advisors.But the recent market plunge (and the one back in early 2020) spooked many clients, who sold stocks in favor of cash and haven't bought back in yet, according to Louis Barajas, president and partner at MGO Wealth Advisors in Newport Beach, California. ""So we have to get money invested back in equities,"" said Barajas, a certified financial planner.For clients of all ages, inflation is having the biggest impact on their cash flow, which is in a ""tight squeeze,"" he said. His conversations with worried clients have largely focused on the basics: understanding their financial goals and knowing how much money they need.""We are financial therapists right now,"" Barajas added. ""We are holding our clients' hands."""

I'm sort of a canary in the coal mine in that respect.""He said consumption is still doing well at the moment.U.S. GDP declined 1.5% in the first quarter of the year despite strong consumer spending because of weakness in business and private investment. There are two reasons why it's difficult to predict a recession, O'Leary said.The first is that $4.5 trillion dollars were added to the U.S. economy in the past few years ""from a helicopter, into the hands of consumers and businesses all over the land.""That's an unprecedented amount of money pumped into the system, he said.""I deal with numbers each week, of what the consumer's buying with the money they have, they've been given so much of it in the last three years and I'm not in the camp that says a dramatic recession,"" he added. Second, technology has boosted productivity.The direct-to-consumer model is now being used in every sector of the economy, which means higher gross margins and more customer data for companies. It's far more efficient and productive, O'Leary said.""Those that are really saying we're going to get a massive recession could be wrong and be missing returns as this market slowly claws its way back,"" he said. ""I'm erring on the side of a soft landing in terms of my investment strategy,"" the ""Shark Tank"" investor said.He said everyone thinks the central bank is out of control, but he's of the view that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is in a ""pretty good shape"" trying to balance inflation and employment.Even if there are signs of a slowdown or a recession, that risk already appears to be baked into share prices given the major corrections in many indexes, O'Leary pointed out.""Everybody that's telling me it's the end of the free world as we know it is not looking at the data,"" he said, adding that some private companies he's invested in have had ""spectacular quarters.""

2022-06-16,"Yields for several peripheral euro nations rose last week after the European Central Bank suggested it would tighten monetary policy aggressively, but failed to announce any measures to backstop and support the more highly indebted nations. This created unease among investors, who fear fragmentation in the region, and pushed the yield on the Italian 10-year bond above the 4% threshold for the first time since 2014.ECB President Christine Lagarde joined euro zone finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg Thursday to provide more detail on the central bank's actions. LUXEMBOURG — There is no need for markets to be worried about the stability of the euro zone, Germany's finance minister told CNBC Thursday following a recent surge in borrowing costs for many governments in the region.Yields for several peripheral euro nations rose last week after the European Central Bank suggested it would tighten monetary policy aggressively, but failed to announce any measures to backstop and support the more highly indebted nations.

Yes of course, we are witnessing some rising spreads amongst the member states, but there is no need for any concern,"" Christian Lindner, Germany's finance minister, said.""In the long-term perspective if you compare interest rates and spreads of today with interest rates or spreads some months or some years ago there is no need for anyone to get nervous. Our unity and our institutions, they make me confident that we could overcome any critical situation.""The ECB looked to reassure markets by convening an emergency meeting Wednesday. The euro zone's central bank said it would be creating a new tool to address fragmentation risks, but there is no information on what type of instrument this will be and when it will be applied. The outcome provided some relief to borrowing costs in the euro zone but it failed to give investors the details they wanted.  ECB President Christine Lagarde joined euro zone finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg Thursday to provide more detail on the central bank's actions.Austria's Finance Minister Magnus Brunner, a fiscally-conservative politician, said he was ""very concerned"" about the recent rise in yields and had one message to his counterparts: ""Bring your budgets in order.""One of the main challenges for the euro zone (where nations share the single currency) is that it has one central bank establishing monetary policy, but 19 different countries with various fiscal positions.""The ECB has to have more possibilities and the ECB can only have possibilities if all the budgets in all member states are in shape,"" Brunner said.Fiscal consolidation in the euro area is not at the top of the agenda for now. The bloc suspended its fiscal rules in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, so capitals would have more leeway to spend more and tackle the new economic reality. This pause is continuing for at least until the end of 2023 as the war in Ukraine brought new challenges, most notably higher inflation. The idea with this continued suspension is to support governments in addressing higher food, petrol and other costs.Nonetheless, for Germany's Lindner, it is clear that ""we all need to return to sound public finances.""""We have to take our responsibilities as finance ministers as well,"" he told CNBC.The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, forecast in May a growth rate of 2.7% for the euro area in 2022 and 2.3% for 2023. However, other institutions are slightly more downbeat on their economic prospects. The OECD expects a 2.6% growth rate for this year and 1.6% for next year.The European Commission is so far avoiding talk of recession in the euro area. Speaking to CNBC in Luxembourg, EU Economics Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said that a recession isn't inevitable, but admitted: ""We are navigating troubled waters.""""This doesn't mean our view is that a recession is inevitable, but of course this means that we will have to concentrate our fiscal policies, in reforms, in investments, in a prudent policy, especially for countries with a high level of debt,"" he said. In the meantime, the euro zone is about to have a new member.Earlier this month, Croatia, which joined the European Union in 2013, received a greenlight to join the euro zone in January next year. The euro area has not expanded since 2015.Speaking to CNBC, Zdravko Marić, Croatia's finance minister said his country has done ""a lot in last couple of years"" to fulfil all the criteria.""We believe that it's very beneficial for Croatia ... the benefits are much bigger than the potential costs,"" he said.""But we also strongly believe that Croatia, as [the] youngest member state of the European Union can also bring more value to [the] euro zone and help and assist.

LONDON — The Bank of England on Thursday implemented a fifth consecutive hike to interest rates as it looks to rein in soaring inflation.The Monetary Policy Committee voted 6-3 to increase the Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, with the three dissenting members voting for a 50 basis point hike to 1.5%.The committee said in a statement Thursday that it will ""take the actions necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term,"" with the the scale, pace and timing of any further hikes depending on the economic outlook and inflationary pressures.""The Committee will be particularly alert to indications of more persistent inflationary pressures, and will if necessary act forcefully in response,"" the bank added.The pound dropped against the dollar shortly after the announcement, but rebounded to gain 0.4% and trade above the $1.22 handle by mid-afternoon.Policymakers face the unenviable task of bringing consumer prices back under control against a backdrop of slowing growth and a rapidly depreciating currency, while the U.K. faces a major cost of living crisis.At its May meeting, the Bank raised its base rate by 25 basis points to 1%, its highest level for 13 years, but warned that the British economy risks falling into recession.Since then, fresh data has shown that U.K. inflation soared to a 40-year high of 9% annually in April as food and energy prices spiraled. The Bank now expects inflation to rise to ""slightly above 11%"" in October, reflecting higher projected household energy prices following an expected further increase to the U.K. energy price cap.Inflation is surging worldwide due to spiking costs of food and energy, which have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and supply fears in agricultural commodities. Supply chain disruptions and demand shifts as a result of the pandemic have also driven up tradable goods prices.However, in its statement Thursday, the MPC acknowledged that not all of the excess inflationary pressure can be chalked up to global events, noting that domestic factors such as a tight labor market and the pricing strategies of firms have also played a role.""Consumer services price inflation, which is more influenced by domestic costs than goods price inflation, has strengthened in recent months. In addition, core consumer goods price inflation is higher in the United Kingdom than in the euro area and in the United States,"" the Bank said.The economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.3% in April after a 0.1% contraction in March, the first back-to-back declines since April and March 2020, and the OECD has forecast that the U.K. will be the weakest G-7 economy next year as higher interest rates, tax rises, reduced trade and spiraling food and energy prices hammer households.The Bank of England's move deviated from the more aggressive actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Swiss National Bank earlier on Thursday. The Fed imposed a 75 basis point hike, its largest since 1994, while the SNB hiked by 50 basis points, which was more than the market expected.A 'case study' for central banksVivek Paul, U.K. chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, noted that the Bank of England was the earliest of its peers to begin the process of monetary policy normalization, and is now further along the tightening path while facing the most acute risks to near-term growth. This means it could serve as a ""case study"" for how central banks worldwide will react as recession risks rise.""We think market expectations of future U.K. rates will ultimately prove to be overdone. According to the Bank's own figures, recession is a genuine risk – and recent government initiatives to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis may prove insufficient to offset U.K. consumer weakness,"" Paul said.""Ultimately, the Bank has less headroom for hikes compared to the U.S.: the neutral rate of interest – that which neither overly stimulates nor restricts economic growth – is lower, and the country's high debt-to-GDP ratio implies greater sensitivity of debt servicing costs to rate rises.""Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan Asset Management, said that with rising gas prices continuing to put upward pressure on consumer prices this year, all the bank could do on Thursday was ""send a clear message"" to other price setters in the economy that 10% price increases are not ""an acceptable new normal.""""It had to show it hasn't gone soft on inflation, or in economic-speak to anchor inflation expectations,"" Ward said.""In our view, a 50 basis point hike would more appropriately have sent that signal. It's possible that by acting cautiously today, it may have to deliver more further down the line."""
2022-06-17,"We have reached the ""be careful what you wish for"" moment for Federal Reserve policy.After months of withering criticism from former Treasury officials, Wall Street economists and others for presumably being behind the inflation curve, the Fed is now facing mounting complaints — from those very same folks — that its more aggressive inflation-fighting plans will drive the U.S. economy into recession.With housing activity declining sharply in the U.S., second-quarter gross domestic product estimates being revised sharply lower, and a rapid build-up of business inventories, it's clear that the economy is slowing much more noticeably than the so-called experts anticipated. This is beginning to cause the type of market-related stresses that have, in the past, put an end to Fed tightening cycles. Mortgage applications have plunged. Mortgage refinancing activity is dead in the water. Pending home sales, as well as sales of new and existing homes, have all plummeted in recent months.With a 30-year fixed rate mortgage now at roughly 6%, a $450,000 house purchased with a 3% mortgage last year has nearly the same monthly payment as a $320,000 home purchased at today's rate. Talk about sticker shock!Consumers appear to be pulling in their horns. They have used up the excess savings that were built up during the pandemic, turning to credit card purchases instead of cash.To some, this indicates that the presumed $2.5 trillion in surplus savings has evaporated.Indeed, after peaking at nearly 34% at the depths of the pandemic — owing to generous measures to blunt the economic impact of sheltering-in-place and working from home — the personal savings rate has declined to 4.4%, about where it was pre-pandemic.There, of course, has also been the obvious impact on financial markets.The Nasdaq Composite is down over 30% from its all-time high. The S&P 500 is off more than 20% from its record. Think negative wealth effect here.Speculative ""meme"" stocks have plunged. Richly valued tech has tumbled. U.S. Treasurys have had the worst six-month performance in bond market history. Credit spreads have widened, and crypto has crashed.The spread between high yield debt and comparable Treasurys has blown out, raising the risk of default among debtors that are below investment grade.Ford says auto loan delinquencies are rising, while 60% corporate CEOs predict a recession is now likely in the next 12 to 18 months.It seems it won't take that long, judging from current market-based recession indicators.Indeed, there will be economic pain from a more aggressive Fed move to quell inflation, which stems more from supply-side disruptions, than from demand-side imbalances. Fed policy, which essentially influences interest rate policies around the world, is causing strains outside our borders, as well.The European Central Bank held an emergency meeting to find ways to support Europe's most heavily indebted nations – including Italy, Spain and Portugal – even as it raises rates to fight inflation.Good luck with running those policies in concurrent fashion.Global monetary policies are asynchronous: China and Japan are easing, while the U.S., the EU, Britain and Switzerland are tightening.That may well lead to additional global strains, as the unintended consequences of ""zero coordination policies"" will bring some markets to the breaking point.We witnessed this in 1994 during the Mexican peso crisis, in which there were massive strains on the peso-dollar peg. This led to the U.S. Treasury and the International Monetary Fund bailing out Mexico when its currency crashed.Orange County, California, thanks to some horrible bond bets in its own treasury, declared bankruptcy in 1994. This leading the Fed to change course and start cutting interest rates to stop the damage being done at home and abroad.Similarly, the Asian currency crisis in 1997, the Russian debt crisis and the related collapse of Long-Term Capital Management have also forced the Fed to stop raising rates and start easing all over again.      It's often said that the Fed will raise rates ""until something breaks.""Something is about to break somewhere. With the benefit of hindsight, those who called on the Fed to be aggressive will also claim they foresaw the consequences of a tough tightening cycle.I hope someone calls them out for such duplicity.— Ron Insana is a CNBC contributor and a senior advisor at Schroders."
2022-06-17,"The S&P 500 posted its 10th down week in the last 11. The index is now well into a bear market.Bank of America global economist Ethan Harris described the U.S. economy as ""one revision away from recession.""Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be in the hot seat again next week, as he returns to Capitol Hill to testify before both houses of Congress. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve appeared to enter a new reality this week, and the result for investors was big losses with no obvious end point in sight.The S&P 500 posted its 10th down week in the last 11, and is now well into a bear market. On Thursday, all 11 of its sectors closed more than 10% below their recent highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 30,000 for the first time since January 2021 this past week.Unlike recent drawdowns for stocks, however, the central bank will not be putting a bottom in the market. Instead, the Fed raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday — its biggest since 1994 — and signaled continued tightening ahead. Chair Jerome Powell will testify before Congress next week and is expected to hold firm on his plan for a more aggressive Fed until inflation is brought to heel. Bank of America equity strategist Ajay Singh Kapur said in a note to clients on Friday that it is time for investors to stop fighting the Fed and give up the buy-the-dip mentality.""In a bear market, heroism is punished. Valor is unnecessary, and cowardice is called for in portfolio construction — that is the way to preserve capital and live to fight another day, waiting for the next central bank panic, and better valuations and a new earnings upcycle,"" Kapur wrote.Tech stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, have been hit particularly hard, as have cyclical plays such as airlines and cruise lines.But the dramatic declines have not been limited to stocks. Bitcoin dropped more than 30% in a week amid reports about blowups of crypto-focused trading firms. Treasury yields, which move opposite of bond prices, have spiked.Markets briefly rallied on Wednesday afternoon after the Fed's announcement, but that optimism was quickly dashed and the gains reversed on Thursday. Many strategists are warning that markets and sentiment could have further to fall, pointing to Wall Street earnings estimates that curiously still show solid growth in the coming year.""These people need to fight inflation as fast as possible and as hard as possible. And the market has consistently been behind the curve on trying to understand how aggressive this Fed was going to be,"" said Andrew Smith, chief investment strategist at Delos Capital Advisors. The impact of the Fed's rate hikes on the market has been magnified by deteriorating economic data, as investors and strategists appear to be losing confidence in the central bank's ability to achieve a soft landing.The housing market appears to be cooling rapidly, with housing starts and mortgage applications plummeting. Consumer sentiment is plumbing record lows. Jobless claims are beginning to trend higher as reports of layoffs at tech firms grow. And all oil prices show no signs of falling back below $100 per barrel as the summer travel season kicks off.In a note to clients on Friday, Bank of America global economist Ethan Harris described the U.S. economy as ""one revision away from recession.""""Our worst fears around the Fed have been confirmed: they fell way behind the curve and are now playing a dangerous game of catch up. We look for GDP growth to slow to almost zero, inflation to settle at around 3% and the Fed to hike rates above 4%,"" Harris wrote.Even among more optimistic economists, the outlook calls for a rather bumpy landing. JPMorgan's Michael Feroli said in a note Friday that he expected Powell to be ""largely successful"" in balancing fighting inflation with economic growth, but a recession is a distinct possibility.""This desired soft landing is not guaranteed, and Fed chair Powell himself has noted that achieving this goal may not be entirely straightforward. And with a tight labor market and the economy dealing with the shocks of tighter financial conditions and higher food and energy prices, recession risks are notable as we think about the next few years,"" Feroli wrote. ""Our models point to 63% chance of recession over the next two years and 81% odds that a recession starts over the next three."" Powell will be in the hot seat again next week, as he returns to Capitol Hill to testify before both houses of Congress, and he is unlikely to soften his stance over the weekend.The Fed Chair said on Wednesday that he and his committee members were ""absolutely determined"" to keep inflation expectations from rising. The central bank said in a report to Congress on Friday ahead of the hearings that its commitment to price stability is ""unconditional.""Inflation has risen to a top political issue, as well as an economic one, and the Fed's raised forecast for unemployment could also come under scrutiny from lawmakers. ""As they're going to 2.5%, 3.5% [Fed funds rate], if the economy is slowing toward a recession, I don't think they're going to stand on the throat of the economy to get inflation to go down,"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist for PGIM Fixed Income. ""...Otherwise, in order to get inflation down from 3.5% to 2%, you're going to have to lose your job. That's going to be the message: We're going to have to get some job losses and recession. And I don't think that trade-off is going to be worth it for them.""On Friday, investors will get an updated consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan. That measure has now taken on increased significance after Powell pointed to it this week as one of the reasons the Fed decided to raise its rate hike this month.The survey's preliminary reading for June showed a record low for sentiment, and confirmation of that number — or even further deterioration — would likely serve as further proof that the Fed will not waver in the coming months. The inflation expectations part of the survey, which rose in the preliminary reading, will be watched closely.Outside of those events, next week is relatively light for economic events, with U.S. stock markets closed on Monday for Juneteenth.

2022-06-17,"Companies are showing concerns of a recession, and in the crypto space, many are preparing for a crypto winter.Coinbase is laying off 18% of its workforce, or roughly 1,100 people, according to an email sent to employees Tuesday morning. CEO Brian Armstrong said the company grew ""too quickly"" during a bull market and expressed concerns of a looming recession.""We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,"" Armstrong said in the email. ""While it's hard to predict the economy or the markets, we always plan for the worst so we can operate the business through any environment.""Here's why businesses are preparing for a crypto winter, and what that means for investors. People have been speculating for a few months about the possibility of a crypto winter, which refers to when crypto prices fall and stay low for an extended period of time.Bitcoin has dropped around 55% year-to-date and sits at around $21,000 per coin. It's down about 70% from an all-time high of $69,000 per coin in November. The overall market capitalization of crypto assets dropped to less than $1 trillion from its peak of $3 trillion in November.The most recent crypto winter happened in late 2017 and early 2018, when bitcoin crashed as much as 80% from all-time highs and took about 18 months to recover. Meanwhile, stocks officially entered bear market territory this week, with the S&P 500 index down around 23% since the beginning of the year as of Friday afternoon. Experts are predicting a recession could be around the corner.It's hard to say how the current swing will shake out, says William Luther, an economics professor at Florida Atlantic University and director of the American Institute for Economic Research's Sound Money Project.He says it's important to keep the long view: If you think these are valuable assets, then you believe their use will be more prevalent in the future and ""you see this as more of a seasonal swing. That's why folks call it a crypto winter, because it suggests that there is a spring on the horizon.""""Judging by past experience, there have tended to be these ebbs and flows in the in the crypto market,"" he tells CNBC Make It. Businesses are worried that with crypto assets dropping in price, investors will decrease their trading activity, which is how firms make money.That means companies have to find ways to reduce costs, like by reducing their workforce. Coinbase joins a growing list of crypto companies, including BlockFi and Crypto.com, that recently announced hiring freezes and then staff cuts in order to reduce costs.For most businesses, current swings in the market are still relatively small, ""so you don't see most companies in the economy laying off 20% of their workers when there's a market decline,"" Luther says.With cryptocurrencies, though, ""there's the potential for their value to fluctuate a lot more than other assets, and so you see companies adjacent to those coins expanding and contracting much more."" Luther says the good news is that current crypto volatility shouldn't change your broader portfolio strategy. ""You should have a strategy in place where you have a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds and potentially crypto assets as well, where you've thought carefully about that asset allocation.""Other than rebalancing your portfolio if the value of your assets has changed, ""I don't see anything that's happened in the last in the last six months that would cause me to change my portfolio strategy,"" Luther says.Experts typically advise crypto remain a small part of your total portfolio, between 1% and 5%, and that you only put in as much money as you're comfortable losing.However, for those interested in geting into crypto, now isn't the best time, Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management, recently told CNBC. He made one exception for people with very long-time horizons and who are dollar-cost averaging into the asset.Those buying in now should have ""long-term conviction,"" Tyrone Ross, CEO and co-founder of Turnqey Labs, Inc. previously told CNBC. He said buying into crypto now has a similar risk and potential reward of venture-backed investing.If anything, Luther sees the current crypto swings as a reminder of what he tells his students: Be cautious of owning too much stock in their employer, especially if they work in a volatile industry.He knows it's a tough sell to people building the technology: ""They're very excited about it, and they naturally want to own a piece of the assets that they're creating. ""But they should at the very least recognize that's a very risky proposition, when they could be diversifying away some of that risk by by holding a more traditional portfolio.""Check out:Stocks have officially entered bear market territory—here’s what that means and what you should doYou shouldn’t look at your investment accounts every day—here’s whyTech experts call for Congress to bring 'skeptical approach' to crypto industrySign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"
2022-06-20,"Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, has abundant natural deposits of tin, copper, nickel, cobalt and bauxite, some of which are key materials for electric vehicle batteries.Indonesian President Joko Widodo said the government has been in talks with electric carmaker Tesla as well as Ford and other car companies to set up manufacturing facilities, including a vehicle factory, in Indonesia.Widodo, or Jokowi as he is popularly known at home, said he suggested to Elon Musk that Tesla could build base its entire supply chain in the country. President Joko Widodo denied that Indonesia has turned protectionist during his tenure, saying the gates remain open to all players — including Tesla — that want to use the country's plentiful natural resources, if they set up plants that can add to the local economy.Widodo, or Jokowi as he is popularly known at home, said the government has been in talks with electric carmaker Tesla as well as Ford and other car companies to set up manufacturing facilities, including a vehicle factory, in Indonesia.The Indonesian president said he met Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive officer and the world's richest man, in May after U.S. President Joe Biden hosted a summit for Southeast Asian leaders. Jokowi said he suggested that Tesla could base its entire supply chain in the country.""We had a lot of discussions, particularly on how Tesla can build their industry from upstream to downstream, end-to end starting from smelter then build the cathode and precursor industry, build EV batteries, build lithium batteries [and] then the vehicle factory. Everything in Indonesia, because that's very efficient. That's what I offered,"" Widodo told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Friday in Serang city in Banten province.He said Musk sent a team to Indonesia six weeks ago ""to check the potential of nickel, to check environmental aspects, but the car-related team has not come.""  He said a team could visit in the ""near future"" to evaluate the potential. Jokowi, who has also invited Musk to the G-20 summit, which Indonesia is hosting this year in Bali, said there is ""no decision yet"" on Tesla's plans to invest in Indonesia.  Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, has abundant natural deposits of tin, copper, nickel, cobalt and bauxite, some of which are key materials for electric vehicle batteries.Under Jokowi, resource-rich Indonesia has banned the export of key commodities, including unprocessed nickel in 2020, coal in 2021 and edible oil in April. The last measure was aimed at stabilizing domestic prices.""No, I think it's not protectionism. But we want that added value to be in Indonesia ... If we keep exporting the raw materials, the ones who get the added value are other countries,"" he said.In a bid to boost its economy and put its natural resources to use in domestic manufacturing, Indonesia wants to move away from exporting raw materials. It also wants to be a global player in EV batteries and a manufacturer of electric cars. ""We want to build an industrial ecosystem for lithium batteries,"" Jokowi said, arguing this would also create jobs and generate tax revenue."
2022-06-20,"Indonesia's President Joko Widodo says the war in Ukraine must end as it is driving up food and energy prices which can be dangerous, especially for developing countries like Indonesia.Jokowi, as he's popularly referred to back home, said the war should be resolved through negotiation and dialogue.Despite calls to remove Russia from the G-20, Indonesia has invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to the leaders' summit in Bali in November. He has also invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Indonesia's president says the war in Ukraine must end as it's driving up food and energy prices and putting developing nations like Indonesia at risk.""The most important thing that I'm concerned with is the food price. So, we want the war in Ukraine to be stopped, resolved with negotiation so that we can concentrate [on] the economy,"" President Joko Widodo told CNBC in an exclusive interview in Serang city in Banten province on Friday. ""If not, it will never be over, this is dangerous for countries, particularly, developing countries.""Jokowi, as he's popularly referred to back home, said the war should be resolved through negotiation and dialogue.The Indonesian leader is attending the meeting of the Group of 7 advanced economies at the invitation of host country Germany from June 26-28. Russian news agency Tass reported last week that Jokowi will be meeting President Vladimir Putin on June 30.""After G-7, I will visit several countries that are related [to the] food issue,"" he told told CNBC's Martin Soong. Jokowi declined to confirm if he was visiting Russia or Ukraine, which are among the world's largest producers and exporters of food grain.  As chair of the Group of 20 major economies this year, Indonesia will be hosting the Heads of State and Government Summit in Bali this November. Despite calls to remove Russia from the G-20, Indonesia has invited Putin to the leaders' summit. He has also invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Russia is a member of the grouping but Ukraine is not. Widodo underlined the reasoning behind his decision to invite Zelenskyy to Bali.""There's a problem here and the problem is war. In G-20, we also need to invite Ukraine so that we can resolve the problem,"" he said.In April, the Indonesian leader reportedly turned down Zelenskyy's request for weapons, offering humanitarian aid instead. Indonesia has said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ""unacceptable"" but did not call out Moscow as the aggressor. Supply chain disruptions due to the war have caused a surge in food prices worldwide. The UN's World Food Programme has warned that those facing severe food insecurity in the world could jump to 323 million this year — up from 276 million currently — as a result of the war in Ukraine.Wheat prices have soared since the war started, and has disrupted farming and blocked grain exports from Ukraine. Russia is the world's top wheat exporter. Together with Ukraine, both account for roughly 29% of the global wheat export market. Wheat prices are higher by more than 50% compared to a year ago. The U.S. and China are engaged in a tussle for dominance in Southeast Asia, with the U.S. calling the Indo-Pacific region the ""heart of American grand strategy"" and China asserting territorial claims over almost all of the South China Sea.Asked about whether Indonesia was caught in the geopolitical tussle between the U.S. and China, Jokowi insisted his country was ""close friends"" with both.The Indonesian president went on to say that Indonesia's trading relations with both countries remained strong, and that the U.S. and China are both strategic partners to Southeast Asia's largest economy. U.S. bilateral goods trade with Indonesia amounted to more than $37 billion in 2021, while bilateral trade in services were at an estimated $2.4 billion in 2020, according to the State Department.China is Indonesia's largest trading partner, with trade estimated at $124.34 billion in 2021, according to Chinese customs data reported by the Indonesia's embassy in China.On whether the Quad strategic alliance or the AUKUS nuclear and security deal that Australia signed with the UK and the U.S. last year risks angering China, Jokowi said: ""We don't want our region to become the platform for rivalry [between] big countries.""""We want this region to be peaceful so that we can build our country and have better economic growth. Rivalry, let alone war, will not be beneficial for any country."" Following Australia's decision to acquire nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS deal, Indonesia said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the ""continuing arms race and power projection in the region.""Pressed on whether Indonesia's relationship with Australia soured as a result of AUKUS, Jokowi said: ""Most importantly, we want Indonesia and Australia to have [a] better relationship in the future, in investment, in trade, and others, we want it to be better.""

2022-06-20,"Macron's centrist alliance secured 245 seats, falling short of the 289 needed to keep its dominance at the French National Assembly.On the left, an alliance between the Greens and other leftist groups, known as Nupes, won 131 seats in parliament, making it the biggest opposition force in the chamber. However, the view that France is shifting to the left was called into question by the performance of the far-right National Rally party, which increased its seats by six to a total of 89. French President Emmanuel Macron might have been relieved after getting reelected in April — but his second term in office just got a lot more complicated.His Ensemble! alliance has lost its absolute parliamentary majority of five years following a second round of legislative elections.""France is now facing the unsettling prospect of a period of prolonged political instability, while confronting an international crisis in Ukraine and the growing threat of an economic downturn at home,"" Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the consultancy group Eurasia, said in a note Sunday.It was confirmed Monday morning that his centrist group secured 245 seats, falling short of the 289 needed to keep its dominance at the French National Assembly.The next few hours — and likely days — will be dominated by political negotiations, with Ensemble! needing either a permanent or ad hoc partner to help it pass legislation.The center-right political group Les Republicains could play a critical role in this, after winning 65 seats in parliament.However, a coalition — an exception in France, which is usually led by one party — with the right could put pressure on the recently-appointed Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, who's perceived as too left-leaning by many on the right-wing of the political spectrum.On the left, an alliance between the Greens and other leftist groups, known as Nupes, won 131 seats in parliament, making it the biggest opposition force in the chamber.This group, led by Jean-Luc Melenchon who heads a far-left party and opposes France's participation in NATO, performed better than expected. Nupes said Monday that it will put a vote of no confidence against the government on July 5, according to Reuters.However, the view that France is shifting to the left was called into question by the performance of the far-right National Rally party, which increased its seats by six to a total of 89. ""We can't say that President Macron has been rebutted, but there's a bit of a warning there for sure. And it is going to be a hard one to pull,"" Roland Lescure, lawmaker and spokesperson for Macron's party told CNBC's Charlotte Reed Sunday. ""We're going to have to learn how to make the parliament work probably a bit better, we're going to have to negotiate on a case-by-case on the reform agenda. Whether it's pension, whether it's growth, whether it's income, whether it´s environment, [we're] going to have to find people who can support us,"" Lescure added. Macron was first elected in 2017 on a pro-reform agenda, but his vision to overhaul the pension system was pushed back, after protests and the coronavirus pandemic. As such, this is a priority for Macron in his second term — but parliamentary support will be crucial in getting it passed.""Without a majority of his own, Macron will find it more difficult to pursue further reforms, including an increase in the retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65 years,"" Holger Schmieding, chief Europe economist at Berenberg, said in a note Monday.But he said that Macron will still likely be able to pass legislation on a case-by-case basis.  ""At least, as importantly parliament will most likely not reverse his major signature reforms, labour market, corporate taxes, regulations, education, that have helped to turn France into the a better place to invest and create jobs,"" Schmieding added. "
2022-06-21,"Stocks fell slightly Wednesday in choppy trading as markets struggled to sustain a rebound from earlier in the day.Traders also weighed comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who reiterated the central bank's stance to fight inflation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 47.12 points, or 0.15%, to 30,483.13, slipping in the final hour of trading. The S&P 500 dipped 0.13% to 3,759.89. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.15% to 11,053.08.Growing concerns of a recession on Wall Street have recently weighed on stocks. Fed Chair Powell on Wednesday told Congress the central bank has the ""resolve"" to tame inflation that has surged to 40-year highs. ""At the Fed, we understand the hardship high inflation is causing,"" the Fed chief said to the Senate Banking Committee. ""We are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we are moving expeditiously to do so.""Powell added that the Fed will stay the course until it sees ""compelling evidence that inflation is moving down."" He also said achieving a soft landing for the economy without a recession has become ""significantly more challenging.""The Federal Reserve raised rates by 0.75 percentage point last week and hinted another increase of that magnitude was possible next month. The central bank's shift last week to a more aggressive inflation-fighting stance unnerved investors who worried the central bank would rather risk a recession than endure persistent high inflation.""Inflation remains the biggest risk to financial assets, and Jerome Powell has made his position abundantly clear: The Fed will continue to raise interest rates until inflation begins to wane. Until then, a sustainable rally for risk assets is hard to imagine,"" wrote Robert Schein, chief investment officer of Blanke Schein Wealth Management.""Tight monetary conditions will continue to be a headwind to financial markets until the Fed gives the greenlight,"" Schein continued.Recession concernsExpectations of a pending recession continued to grow on Wall Street this week. Citigroup raised chances of a global recession to 50%, pointing to data that consumers are starting to pull back on spending.""The experience of history indicates that disinflation often carries meaningful costs for growth, and we see the aggregate probability of recession as now approaching 50%,"" read a note from Citigroup. Goldman Sachs believes a recession is becoming increasingly likely for the U.S. economy, saying that the risks are ""higher and more front-loaded.""""The main reasons are that our baseline growth path is now lower and that we are increasingly concerned that the Fed will feel compelled to respond forcefully to high headline inflation and consumer inflation expectations if energy prices rise further, even if activity slows sharply,"" the firm said in a note to clients.Meanwhile, UBS said Tuesday in a note to clients that it does not expect a U.S. or global recession in 2022 or 2023 in its base case, ""but it's clear that the risks of a hard landing are rising.""""Even if the economy does slip into a recession, however, it should be a shallow one given the strength of consumer and bank balance sheets,"" UBS added.

2022-06-21,"Stagflation is a term coined in the 1970s to refer to a combination of high inflation and high unemployment.Recent surveys show economists and fund managers see increased risks of stagflation on the horizon.There are steps you can take now to get in a better financial position in case stagflation or a recession does happen. The next big risk to the U.S. economy may be summed up in one word.And no, it's not necessarily recession, though economists are evenly split on the risks one is coming.Instead, 80% of economists in the same survey named stagflation as the greater long-term risk to the economy, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. The next biggest risk they identified was deflation, with 13% of respondents.More from Personal Finance:Stimulus checks rewired how some Americans see money43% of homeowners delayed home improvements due to inflationHere's what the Fed's interest rate hike means for youMoreover, a recent Bank of America global fund manager survey found fears of stagflation are the highest they have been since June 2008. Stagflation is ""by far and away the most popular description of what the economic backdrop will be in the next 12 months,"" according to the report. Stagflation is a term coined in the 1970s when there was simultaneous high inflation and economic stagnation or high unemployment, according to Jonathan Wright, professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University.While there were some nasty recessions back then, many economists aren't expecting a return to anything like that now, he said.""The sense in which you had stagflation in the 1970s is not one that I think is at all in the cards,"" Wright said.However, high inflation is prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates — known as tightening monetary policy. With that, it is ""quite likely"" the unemployment rate will rise ""a fair bit"" from the 3.6% it is at now, Wright said. The result may at least be a mild recession, he said.Stagflation may happen if a recession sets in before inflation has gone down to where the Fed wants it to be, Wright said. For example, if unemployment were to go up to about 5% and consumer price index inflation were also at above 5% in 2023, that would be a kind of stagflation, though not to the degree we experienced in the 1970s, he said.""It certainly would mean that the job market would be a lot less hot than it's been,"" Wright said.In the near term, the labor market may cool simply by having fewer vacancies, he said. Despite surveys sounding the alarm on stagflation, not everyone agrees it's inevitable.""It doesn't seem like a high probability,"" said Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute.To have stagflation, you need both high unemployment and high inflation at the same time, which Bivens does not see as likely. ""If we had a situation where unemployment rose pretty sharply, I actually think that would likely cause inflation to start coming down pretty sharply,"" Bivens said.A more likely scenario is that if we end the year with a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, we could be in a recession by 2023, he said.""If that happens, I just expect inflation to relent pretty quickly,"" Bivens said. A combination of inflation and shrinkflation, where product companies reduce the contents of everything that we buy, is making it so people's money just doesn't go as far now, said Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner and CEO of Oxygen Financial in Atlanta.Now, stagflation is also a possibility that clients are asking about, Jenkin said.""I think it's inevitable that we're going to hit a recession,"" he said. ""Whether this is a mild recession or we go into stagflation will be the big question.""Consequently, now is a great time to revisit your personal financial plan.""This is the absolute time for people to batten down the hatches and beef up the foundation of their financial house,"" Jenkin said. Try to aim for at least six months' worth of emergency expenses in case a downturn does happen, he said. Also make sure you have prepared a recent budget to see if there are places where you can cut back.Additionally, take a look at any adjustable-rate debt you may have — credit cards, mortgages, student loans — and see if you can pare those balances down or refinance them. Now that interest rates are poised to go up, those balances will become more expensive.Moreover, it's a great time to invest in yourself to be more marketable professionally if layoffs become the norm.""Make sure you've really brushed up on your skills and competencies or education so that if the job market gets tighter, you're marketable,"" Jenkin said."
2022-06-22,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank is ""strongly committed"" to bringing down inflation and can do so with its monetary policy tools.That means higher interest rates until ""compelling evidence"" emerges that inflation is coming down. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told congressional lawmakers Wednesday that the central bank is determined to bring down inflation and has the ability to make that happen.""At the Fed, we understand the hardship high inflation is causing. We are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we are moving expeditiously to do so,"" the Fed chief said in remarks for the Senate Banking Committee. ""We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.""Along with expressing resolve on inflation, Powell said economic conditions are generally favorable, with a strong labor market and persistently high demand.But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warned Powell that the continued rate hikes could ""tip this economy into recession"" without stopping inflation.""You know what's worse than high inflation and low unemployment is high inflation and a recession with millions of people out of work, and I hope you'll reconsider that before you drive the economy off a cliff,"" she said.Though Powell said he believes the economy is strong now, he acknowledged a recession could happen.

""It's not our intended outcome at all, but it's certainly a possibility, and frankly the events of the last few months around the world have made it more difficult for us to achieve what we want, which is 2% inflation and still a strong labor market.""Achieving a ""soft landing,"" in which policy tightens without severe economic circumstances such as a recession, will be difficult, he added.""It is our goal. It is going to be very challenging. It has been made significantly more challenging by the events of the last few months, thinking here of the war and commodities prices and further problems with supply chains."" Powell said. ""The question of whether we're able to accomplish that is going to depend to some extent on factors that we don't control."" Powell insisted that inflation is running too hot and needs to come down. The consumer price index in May increased 8.6% over the past year, the highest level since December 1981.""Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2%,"" Powell said. ""We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.""He noted that the war in Ukraine and Covid-linked shutdowns in China are adding to inflation pressures, and added that the problem is not unique to the U.S. but is affecting many global economies.Powell's remarks are part of a congressionally mandated semiannual report on monetary policy – more commonly known in markets as the Humphrey Hawkins report and testimony, for the act which mandated them.This is an especially delicate moment for Fed policy.Over its past three meetings, the central bank has raised rates a cumulative 150 basis points – 1.5 percentage points – in an effort to tackle inflation that is running at its fastest annual pace in more than 40 years.The 75 basis point increase at last week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting marked the biggest single hike since 1994. Powell said he sees rates rising to a ""moderately restrictive level.""Republican senators pressed Powell to clamp down on inflation, and asked whether White House policies such as regulations on the energy industry are intensifying price pressures.""Inflation's hitting my people so hard they're coughing up bones,"" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.""We got a hell of a mess right now,"" Kennedy added. ""You're the most powerful man in the United States, maybe in the world."" Powell has stressed that he thinks tighter monetary policy will be an effective tool against inflation, and has said he thinks the economy is well positioned to handle higher rates. However, he also told Warren that higher rates won't do much to lower soaring food and gasoline costs.Cracks have been showing in the economy this year that indicate the higher rates are coming as the economy already is slowing.Gross domestic product declined at a 1.5% annualized pace in the first quarter and is on pace to be flat in the second quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed. Housing sales have been plunging and there even have been some signs that the jobs market is slowly decelerating at a time when inflation-adjusted wages have fallen 3% over the past year.Despite the economic wobbles, Powell and his fellow policymakers have indicated the rate hikes will continue. Projections released at the meeting last week point to the Fed's benchmark short-term borrowing rate rising to 3.4% by the end of this year, from its current targeted range of 1.5%-1.75%.Correction: The Fed's benchmark short-term borrowing rate is currently in a targeted range of 1.5%-1.75%.

2022-06-22,"[The stream is set to start at 9:30 a.m. ET]Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday began two days of testimony in front of Congress. The central bank chief is expected to provide updates on the state of the economy and on how the Fed plans to curb inflationary pressures not seen since the early 1980s.The consumer price index last month rose by 8.6%, its highest increase since December 1981.Earlier this month, the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point. ""Clearly, today's 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common,"" Powell said then. He added, however, that he sees the central bank raising rates by another 50 or 75 basis points next month.

2022-06-22,"Mark Zuckerberg told CNBC's Jim Cramer that Meta Platforms is in a position to spend extensively on long-term research.The metaverse should usher in a massive economy, he said. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday that the metaverse could be a considerable part of the social network operator's business in the second half of the decade.""We hope to basically get to around a billion people in the metaverse doing hundreds of dollars of commerce, each buying digital goods, digital content, different things to express themselves, so whether that's clothing for their avatar or different digital goods for their virtual home or things to decorate their virtual conference room, utilities to be able to be more productive in virtual and augmented reality and across the metaverse overall,"" he said.Investors have cut the company's market capitalization in half this year as growth has slowed and the number of its daily active users declined sequentially for the first time between the last two quarters. Zuckerberg has been increasingly directing the company toward what he views as the next generation of content, a virtual world where people can buy and sell digital goods for avatars who can communicate with one another. The company's ticker symbol changed from FB, a relic of its history as a pure social media provider, to META earlier this month.But the company's investment in augmented reality and virtual reality dates back to 2014, when it paid $2 billion for headset maker Oculus VR. Shipments of headsets have failed to outnumber shipments of PCs or smartphones. Zuckerberg expressed optimism about the performance of its current-generation Meta Quest 2, which starts at $299.""Quest 2 has been a hit,"" Zuckerberg told the ""Mad Money"" host.""I've been really happy with how that's gone. It has exceeded my expectations. But I still think it's going to take a while for it to get to the scale of several hundreds of millions or even billions of people in the metaverse, just because things take some time to get there. So that's the north star. I think we will get there. But, you know, the other services that we run are at a somewhat larger scale already today.""Experiences in the metaverse can be more immersive than text, photos or videos, which are pervasive on Meta's Facebook and Instagram, and so it will be a big theme for Meta over the next decade, Zuckerberg said.Zuckerberg met with Cramer in the metaverse. The Facebook co-founder said such experiences can foster a sense of being together, even if people are physically on the other side of the country. He said it's possible to make eye contact, which isn't guaranteed on video calls, and use spatial audio that allow for quiet side conversations.The technology ""basically adds up to making it deliver this realistic sense of presence,"" he said.Bringing that to customers over the next several years will require Meta to release a stack of hardware, software and experiences.""We are at this point, you know, a company that can afford to make some big long-term research investments, and this is a big focus,"" he said.He expects the economy around the metaverse to be massive, he said.Meta Platforms had 3.64 billion monthly active people across its family of applications in the first quarter, up 6% year over year. WhatsApp reached 2 billion users in 2020, and it's also an area where Zuckerberg sees the potential for growth.""You know, our playbook over time has been build services, try to serve as many people as possible — you know, get our services to a billion, two billion, three billion people, and then we basically scale the monetization after that,"" Zuckerberg said. ""And we've done that with Facebook and Instagram. WhatsApp is really going to be the next chapter, with business messaging and commerce being a big thing there."" In addition to its metaverse spending, Meta is investing heavily in the development of artificial intelligence, which can bolster advertising — the source of around 97% of revenue — and the company's existing applications, Zuckerberg said.""We're basically shifting from having most of the content that you see in Facebook and Instagram come from your friend or follow graph, to now, you know, over time, having more and more of that content just come from AI recommendations,"" Zuckerberg said. ""And as the AI recommendations get better, you get access to, you know, not just the content from the people who you follow but the whole universe of content that's out there.""It's a concept that TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, used to propel itself to a billion monthly active users. Meta sought to respond to the rapid growth with the introduction of its Reels feature of Instagram in 2020. Reels makes up over one-fifth of the time people spend on Instagram, Zuckerberg told analysts on Meta's first-quarter earnings call in April. Now he expects AI enhancements to make Reels more compelling to Instagram's users.""Our AI system can choose based on what it knows about you and what you personally are going to be interested in and learn about, what you want to see,"" he said. ""So as we get better at that, you know, our engineers are shipping improvements to the models every week. We check something and, you know, relevance goes up by a few percent. And then we repeat and do that the next week. And, you know, this is just a huge part of what I've always focused on in running this company, is getting the velocity to be very quick, so we can keep on making fast improvements to this.""Meta is also investing in hardware for AI, alongside other large technology companies, such as Alphabet and Microsoft.""We just brought online the AI research supercluster, which, you know, we believe is going to be the fastest AI supercomputer when it's fully built out later this year, so that our researchers can build new and bigger models to both make the ranking and recommendations across our social media services and ads better.""The company will slow its investment in AI in the event of a recession, Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg addressed questions around the departure of Sheryl Sandberg, the company's operating chief. Sandberg built up Facebook's advertising business, making its 2012 initial public offering possible. The Wall Street Journal reported that she left after Meta began a review of her use of company resources for wedding planning. A Meta spokesperson told the newspaper that internal investigations of Sandberg didn't have anything to do with her choice to step down.""I don't think any of the stuff that's been reported contributed to her leaving the company,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Of course, you'd have to ask her about that. But what I can say is that I have nothing but gratitude for the amazing work that she's done at the company. She's going to stay on our board. She's a key person. She's a close friend."" — CNBC's Jonathan Vanian contributed to this report.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.DisclaimerQuestions for Cramer?

2022-06-23,"The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits edged down last week as labor market conditions remained tight, though some slowing is emerging.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 229,000 for the week ended June 18, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 227,000 applications for the latest week.Claims have been treading water since tumbling to more than a 53-year low of 166,000 in March amid signs of some cooling in the labor market. There have been reports of job cuts mostly in the technology and housing sectors, with the latter experiencing a moderation in activity as mortgage rates surge in response to rising inflation expectations and aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.The overall labor market, however, remains tight. There were 11.4 million job openings at the end of April, with nearly two openings for every unemployed person. Economists say claims would need to rise above 250,000 to help bring labor demand and supply back into balance to tame wage inflation.The U.S. central bank last week raised its policy rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, its biggest hike since 1994. The Fed has increased its benchmark overnight interest rate by 150 basis points since March.Its quest to dampen demand in the labor market and overall economy is fanning fears of a recession next year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday the central bank was not trying to engineer a recession to tame inflation, but was fully committed to bringing prices under control even if doing so risked an economic downturn.Recent retail sales, housing and manufacturing data suggest the economy is already losing speed after appearing to have rebounded from the first quarter's slump, which was mostly driven by a record trade deficit.Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of June's employment report. Claims rose moderately between the May and June survey periods.The economy added 390,000 jobs in May. The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 5,000 to 1.315 million during the week ending June 11.Next week's data on the so-called continuing claims will shed more light on June's employment report."

BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping made a rare statement Wednesday about his country's aims to achieve its economic goals for the year.Investment analysts have cut their forecasts for China's GDP growth to well below the official target after stringent Covid controls restricted business activity in the last few months. Government stimulus has been relatively muted so far.""We will step up macroeconomic policy adjustment, and adopt more forceful measures to deliver the economic and social development goals for the whole year and minimize the impact of COVID-19,"" Xi said Wednesday, according to an English-language state media readout.He did not share details on what kind of measures would be used to support growth. Rather than ""more forceful,"" Chinese text of the speech published by state media described forthcoming measures as ""more effective,"" according to a CNBC translation.However, Xi's unusually direct language mark a rare public mention by a senior leader of the full-year economic targets since they were set at an annual meeting in mid-March.Those goals include unemployment in cities of ""no more than 5.5%,"" an increase in the consumer price index of ""around 3%"" and GDP growth of ""around 5.5%."" The median GDP forecast among investment banks tracked by CNBC is far lower, at 3.4%.Bank of America became the latest to cut earlier this week, while Nomura has the lowest forecast of 3.3%. Goldman Sachs is the only major investment bank with a forecast of 4% or slightly higher.""While growth recovery appears to have accelerated in June, barring dramatically more policy easing, we think the 'around 5.5% GDP growth' target remains extremely challenging this year,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Maggie Wei and a team said in a note Wednesday.In May, Premier Li Keqiang called on officials at an unprecedentedly massive videoconference to ""work hard"" for growth in the second quarter.

BRUSSELS — European leaders are growing increasingly concerned about the possibility of a full shutdown of gas supplies from Russia, with Italy asking for a new meeting to debate the matter.Gazprom, Russia's state-backed energy supplier, has reduced its gas flows to Europe by about 60% over the past few weeks, prompting Germany, Italy, Austria and the Netherlands to all indicate they could turn back to coal once again.It comes as Europe — which receives roughly 40% of its gas via Russian pipelines — tries to rapidly reduce its reliance on Russian hydrocarbons in response to the Kremlin's nearly four-month-long onslaught in Ukraine.""Russia is diminishing the supply of gas little by little — to some countries [by] almost 100%; to others, cutting 10, 15%,"" Josep Borrel, the EU's top diplomat, told CNBC Friday.""I don't think they are going to cut the gas overnight, especially as we are going into the summer and during the summer the gas is not a strategic weapon.

2022-06-24,"Steel inventory is slowly piling up in their warehouses as demand for steel in China falls amid pandemic lockdowns and crippled construction activity.Chinese blast furnaces are now operating close to full capacity, at more than 90% — the highest rate in 13 months — despite thinner profits, analysts say. Australian and Brazilian iron ore miners are safe for now. Steel mill owners in parts of China are in a bad mood, Beijing-based commodities consultant Simon Wu said.Steel inventories are slowly piling up in the warehouses of the country's biggest steelmaking hub, the northeastern city of Tangshan, as well as in the provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong, mill owners told Wu, a senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie.related investing newsSell this lithium stock with high exposure to the chemical's price, Goldman Sachs saysAlex Harringa day agoDemand for steel is falling amid pandemic lockdowns and crippled construction activity, they said.""There's negative energy all round. The steel industry is just not making any profit,"" Wu said. A lot of steel — a key raw material in the manufacturing powerhouse — is sitting idle around the country amid a stop-and-start economy which is forcing down demand and prices.Prices of both steel and its main ingredient iron ore were volatile during the Shanghai lockdown but headed on a downward trajectory earlier this month.Weak demand for steel, a bellwether of China's economy, also reflected the country's broader slowdown, though recent data pointed to some improvement as industrial production rose slightly by 0.7% in May from a year ago.Crucially, China's steelmaking industry — the biggest in the world — hosts extensive supply chains that stretch from Chinese blast furnaces to overseas iron ore mines in Australia and Brazil, the biggest suppliers of iron ore to China.Because of that, any jitters within China can unravel an extensive network of supply chains, potentially heaping further pressures on existing global disruptions.  According to the China Iron and Steel Association, national daily outputs of intermediary steel products such as crude steel and pig iron as well as finished goods had been rising over the month of May by between about 1% and 3%. In contrast, demand, while still active, had fallen. China's consumption of crude steel, for instance, fell 14% in May compared with last year, S&P Global Commodity Insights iron ore lead Niki Wang said, citing in-house analyses.""The year-on-year decline in steel demand was much greater than that of crude steel production. In that case, steel mills are indeed struggling (with the pressure on steel prices),"" she said. That period coincided with China's biggest citywide pandemic lockdown yet in Shanghai. Consequently, inventory levels are 12% higher compared with last year and may take nearly two months to fall to the median levels of the past five years, assuming steel demand roars back to life, said Richard Lu, steel research analyst at CRU Group.The Chinese market is also competing with a proliferation of cheaper Russian semi-finished steel billets, said Paul Lim, lead analyst of Asia ferrous raw materials and steel at Fastmarkets Asia. As outbreaks gripped the nation, the country's biggest consumers of steels as well as the Chinese economy's growth engines such as property construction and infrastructure development have gone quiet, said Navigate Commodities managing director Atilla Widnell.That's because ""there is simply no one to work at the sites,"" he added, pointing out the industry was taken aback by the return of lockdowns.After a much-awaited opening of Shanghai in early June after new cases were recorded for both Beijing and Shanghai, China started re-imposing some restrictions.Last week, new data from China's National Bureau of Statistics showed property investment for the first five months of the year declined 4% from a year earlier, increasing from the 2.7% drop between January and April. Home sales by volume fell 34.5% on year in the first five months of 2022.  ""There had been signs of life for domestic steel consumption after China's exit from lockdowns in early June, but the 'stop-start' disruptions caused by a relapse into scattered lockdowns [have] been an unwelcome blow to the country's well-intended economic recovery,"" Widnell said.  Even though steel prices have fallen and eroded steelmaking profitability, steel mill owners have continued production, with many using iron ore of lower quality to produce smaller volumes.Chinese blast furnaces are now operating close to full capacity, at more than 90% — the highest rate in 13 months — despite thinner profits, analysts said. Lu said some mills suffered ""largely negative margins"" over April and May.Pricing data shows prices of popular steel products such as rebar and hot-rolled coil used for building homes have fallen by up to nearly 30% after peaking around May last year following an industrial revival to kickstart the economy.Shutting down blast furnaces can be inefficient, as large reactors used for turning iron ore into liquid steel need to run continuously.  Once they're shut down, it takes a long time — up to six months — to restart operations. ""So, Chinese operators are keeping their blast furnaces 'hot' by utilizing lower grade ores to voluntarily reduce yields in the hope that they can ramp up swiftly and respond to recovering steel demand as and when temporary lockdowns are lifted,"" Widnell said. ""We believe that these operators are also producing larger quantities of Semi Finished Steel products so as not to crush finished Steel prices with inflated inventories.""Wood Mackenzie's Wu said another reason producers soldier on is so they can hit their annual allowed output targets before Beijing reduces them next year as part of an effort to meet its emissions targets by 2030 and 2060. ""Each year's production is defined by last year's output. So it is to producers' advantage to produce the maximum amount of steel each year as cuts will be applied to that year's output,"" Wu said.  Steel demand and prices slumped between 2012 and 2016 after the Chinese economy slowed heavily, causing commodity prices to fall. For many miners servicing China, such as those in Australia, it was the end of the so-called mining boom.In 2015 alone, China's major steel firms suffered losses of more than 50 billion yuan. For starters, this downturn is not 2015, Wu said, and steel producers have learned to be resilient against volatility.""So, they will keep producing steel because they have to pay wages and maintain other cash flows. Many producers can probably last two years without making money. Many people on the outside [of China] don't understand this resilience,"" he said. CRU's Lu said while some mills are contemplating slowing production, inventory levels are ""far far away from the panic levels"" and storage capacity is not yet a serious issue.There are, however, early signs that the industry is starting to adjust to these adverse conditions.Recently, there were rumors that the Jiangsu provincial government had mandated local steel mills to cut production by about 3.32 million tonnes for the rest of the year. It's not clear if that is an effort to curb excessive steel inventory or part of wider adherence to cutting production and emissions. ""I think China is fully aware of the weaker domestic steel demand this year, and will use executive power to force mills to cut production just like it did before,"" said Alex Reynolds, an analyst at commodity and energy price agency Argus Media.""If steel prices continue to fall sharply with losses extending, the Chinese government may set exact numbers for production cuts - kind of like what the OPEC did when Covid was at its height in 2020-2021."" S&P's Wang agreed, adding that stimulus from Beijing's looser monetary policies should also play a part in reviving steel demand down the track.Meanwhile, others in the steelmaking supply chain, such as Australian and Brazilian iron ore miners, need not worry for now as lower output from the mines have offset lower demand, she said.But miners are nonetheless concerned about bearish conditions in China, Wang added.""The high pig iron production means demand for iron ore is solid. The iron ore inventory at China's major ports has been trending down since the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays,"" she said. Iron ore prices have hovered between $130 and $150 a tonne in the past two months, compared with prices of as low as $30 to $40 a tonne during the 2012-2016 slump."
2022-06-24,"There has been a lot of chatter recently about the possibility of a recession.Yet what exactly does that mean — and what would a potential downturn look like?A recession is defined as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months,"" according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.More from Invest in You:Suze Orman: Every person should have series I bondsStrategies to pay off credit card debt as interest rates riseWhat the Fed's rate hike means for youIt's also ultimately inevitable during the course of the normal economic cycle, said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.""It should not be shocking that they occur,"" he said. ""It is usually the timing, the cause and the depth and duration of them that catch people by surprise."" Economists are watching the economy closely and many are boosting their odds of a recession occurring in the near term. Citigroup, assessing global economic growth over the next 18 months, sees a 50% probability of a global recession happening, while Goldman Sachs has put the odds of a recession for the U.S. in the next year at 30%.However, not everyone is convinced a recession will happen. UBS, for example, has a base case forecast of ""no recession."" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, also thinks as things stand now, a recession is unlikely.""The economy is slowing and it will be uncomfortable over the next 12 to 24 months, but I think we will make our way through it without a recession,"" he said.Of course, something could happen to change that projection.""We are very vulnerable to anything else that could go wrong because things are so fragile,"" Zandi explained. Still, Zandi's current prediction still means some economic pain ahead. ""The economy comes to a standstill, meaning months where we are getting little job growth or negative job growth,"" he said.Unemployment would start to notch higher, perhaps hitting 4% or 4.5% and inflation, while moderating, will still be high, he said.He doesn't see stock prices going anywhere and housing values remaining, at best, flat or even declining in some markets.""For the average American, it is not just going to feel great,"" he said. The duration and depth of recessions are characterized by shapes.For instance, a V-shaped recovery is quick, with a sharp decline to a bottom followed by a dramatic rise. In a U-shaped recovery, on the other hand, the economy spends longer at the bottom and then gradually rebounds.A W-recovery is when the economy passes through a recession and into recovery and then immediately enters another recession, and K-shaped means some parts of the economy recover more quickly than others. A post-World War II typical recession lasts about six to 12 months, although some were longer and one was shorter, Zandi said.The most recent recession occurred in 2020 and was brief — only two months long. The longest recession occurring after 1948, the Great Recession, spanned 18 months, beginning December 2007 and ending June 2009. In a garden variety recession, the economy typically loses 3 million to 4 million jobs, and unemployment can get as high as 6%, Zandi said. The stock market may fall another 5% to 10% and national house prices decline about 5% to 10%, he said.That doesn't necessarily mean that's what will occur if the economy does fall into recession. Right now, the fundamentals of the economy are good, Zandi said.""There is a good chance [if] we do suffer a recession, [that] it will be less severe than a typical one,"" he predicted. Whether a recession happens or not, you should be ready just in case.""I counsel people to prepare for the possibility, to pay down debt, to save money, to consider deferring large purchases,"" said Hamrick.He anticipates that Bankrate's Second-Quarter Economic Indicator survey will put chances of a recession in the next 12-18 months higher than the 1-in-3 odds in the first-quarter survey.Still, that doesn't mean the worst-case scenario.""If there is a downturn here, I think that there is a possibility that it could be relatively short and shallow,"" Hamrick said. ""It need not be ruinous.""SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

2022-06-27,"Carlyle Group co-chairman David Rubenstein tells CNBC from the Aspen Ideas Festival that Chinese government decisions and the Russia-Ukraine war may have more control over recession odds than anything the Federal Reserve does. Much of the U.S. market focus has been on the Federal Reserve's more aggressive interest rate hikes as a reason to fear a recession.But Carlyle Group co-founder and co-chairman David Rubenstein, a billionaire investor and philanthropist, says the economy's path may be beyond the central bank's control, and two other global players are more important when it comes to assessing recession risk.The Fed's efforts to fight inflation with higher interest rates ""can be tricky to know how it will work,"" Rubenstein said on Monday in an interview with CNBC from the Aspen Ideas Festival. ""Nobody knows how that will work out.""Nevertheless, the two most significant issues in his view are what's going to happen with China, including its Covid policy causing the global economy to slow down even more, and the length of the Russia-Ukraine war, which is impacting the energy market.""Currently, no one has the answer,"" Rubenstein said. ""I don't think it's inevitable that there'll be a recession. I do think it's tough to avoid a recession, but it's not inevitable,"" he added. Inside an organization as large as private equity giant Carlyle Group, he says there is no ""common view on any one thing,"" but he added, ""we don't feel we're going into a recession.""China as a risk factor may remain volatile until later this year and a decision by China's Communist Party to award a third term for President Xi Jinping. Once the politics are more clear, there should be greater clarity on Covid policies, as well as tech sector regulation which has unnerved investors. He expects a somewhat softer tone with tech companies than China has recently shown.As the Russia-Ukraine war has led to spikes in energy prices and concerns about energy shortages in Europe, Rubenstein said a reevaluation of the energy transition is taking place. ""Everybody wants more climate-friendly energy, of course, but it's not easy to get there. What we've learned from the Russia-Ukraine war is that the world is still very heavily dependent on carbon energy, and right now, the world is scrambling to get more carbon energy."" He added, ""The world is realizing you can't go to carbon-neutral policies overnight; it will take a while.""Oil prices have already come down from around $140 to $108 per barrel, and Rubenstein thinks the trajectory for prices remains lower with U.S. supply increasing and other major players like Saudi Arabia likely to raise production.In Carlyle's deal market, prices have come down, he said, but there is still room for valuations to come down more, referring to EBITDA multiples to buy companies that are still at ""double-digits levels"" — down from roughly 14 times to 11 to 12 times.""They probably will drift down slightly,"" he said.The deal market is slower, but not dead. Debt remains readily available, the debt component of deals is much lower (under 50%) than it had been historically, and equity valuations are slightly lower if not as low as they will go yet. ""Deals are getting done,"" Rubenstein said, and after a record year for buyout deals in 2021, ""we're on pace to do a fair number this year,"" he added.Disclosure: NBCUniversal News Group is the media partner of the Aspen Ideas Festival."
2022-06-27," (Click here to subscribe to the Delivering Alpha newsletter.)Brookfield Asset Management announced last week that it raised a record $15 billion for its inaugural Global Transition Fund. This marks the world's largest private fund dedicated to the net zero transition, signaling that investors are still committed to establishing cleaner portfolios. However, some blame the trend toward ESG-investing for high energy inflation. Critics say the focus on clean energy has curbed investment in fossil fuels, which may have otherwise helped boost supply. Mark Carney, co-head of Brookfield's Global Transition Fund, says he does not subscribe to this critique. Carney sat down with CNBC's Delivering Alpha newsletter at last week's SuperReturn International conference in Berlin where he explained what's driving inflation in gas prices and energy costs and weighed in on the state of U.S. monetary policy.  (The below has been edited for length and clarity. See above for full video.)Leslie Picker: I want to pick your brain on kind of your central banker – if you can put that hat on for me, because there are so many crosscurrents right now. And I want to just first get your take on the US specifically, because that's where the bulk of our audience is. Is a soft planning still on the table? Or do you think the hard decisions need to be made, and it likely may mean some more pain ahead? Mark Carney: It's a very narrow path in order for the U.S. economy to grow all the way through this. Unemployment has to increase. Financial conditions have already tightened a fair bit, I think they're going to tighten a bit more, as well. And look, there's also some pretty big headwinds from the world. China's effectively in recession, or here in Europe, they're on the cusp of a negative quarter because of the war and other factors. So, the U.S. economy is strong, it's robust and flexible, the households are flexible, lots of positives here. But in order to thread the needle, it's going to be tough.Picker: Do you think 75 basis points is enough?Carney: It's certainly not enough to bring inflation back down and the economy back into balance, which is why what they imply about where policy is going, not just at the end of the year, but where it needs to rest in the medium term is going to be important.Picker: Do you think that the Fed has lost the faith of investors, that investors now see them as being behind the curve in getting this under control?Carney: I think the Fed itself and Chair Powell has acknowledged that, maybe they should have started earlier, recognizing that inflation wasn't transitory. Those are all different ways that we can call it behind the curtain, they've acknowledged that. I think what the Fed is looking to do, and where they will retain investor support, is if it's clear that they're going to get a handle on inflation, they're going to get ahead of this, that they don't think that they can bring inflation down to target by just small adjustments in interest rates. The words and what chair Powell has been saying, what Jay's been saying, in recent weeks and months, [they're] establishing more firmly that they're going to do their job on inflation because they recognize by doing that in the near term, it's better for the U.S. economy, better for jobs in the medium term.Picker: One of the factors that people have been highlighting in response to all the inflation that we're seeing in the environment is this move toward ESG and this focus on renewables and disinvestment from fossil fuels. There are certain critics out there who believe that if we had focused more on that type of investment that we may not have the same kind of inflationary environment that we're having, at least, in gas prices and energy costs and things like that. Based on what you're seeing on the ground, is that actually the case? Is that critique or reality or is that just a talking point that people use?Carney: No, I disagree with the critique. I think it's something we've got to be conscious of going forward. And we'll come back to that...we're at the sharp end of the financial market, private equity world, and the debt world, and look, they got burned in U.S. shale in 2014-2015. No capital discipline in that sector. Destroyed a lot of value, and they withheld capital from shale, which was the marginal barrel of oil. Because of that, because of old fashioned capital discipline. And that's what happened. That's part of what got things so tight. Second point is the industry, as a whole, did not really invest or didn't add barrels during COVID, like many other industries, didn't add barrels during COVID and has been caught out by this resurgence of demand. Now, your question, though, is an important one going forward because we need to have sufficient investment in fossil fuels for the transition while there's a significant ramp up in clean energy. So, the answer isn't no investment in fossil fuels, and it is not the reason why gas prices are where they are. Unfortunately, it's a combination of what happened over the course of the last five years, the reasons I just explained, and also, quite frankly, because there's a war going on.Picker: And that's why you're overseeing the energy transition strategy, not a clean energy strategy. Carney: Brookfield is huge in clean energy. We've got 21 gigawatts existing, we've got 60 gigawatts in the pipeline all around the world. So, we're very active in that. But what we're focusing on just as much is going to where the emissions are, and getting capital to steelmakers, to auto companies, to people in utilities, people in the energy sector so that they can make the investments to get their emissions down. That's where you find a huge amount of value, returns for our investors - ultimately, pensioners, teachers, fire, firefighters, others, pensioners around the world - that's where we create value for them. You also do good by the environment because you get emissions actually down across the economy and that's what we need.Picker: And is that also the same goal with the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative? I think it's $130 trillion worth of AUM behind this idea of having a net zero portfolio by 2050. Carney: Yeah, and it's very much about transition. So again, yes, a lot of it's going to go to clean energy. I mean, clean energy needs are about $3 trillion a year. So, this is a huge investment opportunity, but again, going to where the emissions are, getting those down and helping to wind down emissions in sectors that aren't going to run to their whole economic life. Look, we're here in Europe, we're here in Germany. Germany has put out a number of things. So, they're going to have a clean energy system by 2035. They're going to accelerate the approval process for these projects from six years to one year. They're putting legislation in place across Europe. They're tripling the pace of solar, they're quadrupling the pace of hydrogen all this decade. Huge opportunity here in Europe, that's being replicated elsewhere. But what comes with that is industrial decarbonization, if I can put it that way, and so Brookfield can play on both sides on the clean energy, but again, really going from everyone from tech to automakers to steel, to helping those companies move. Picker: Interesting, because it's industrial emissions that are the biggest chunk of the pie, not necessarily how you drive your car. Carney: Well, yeah, it's industrial emissions. Some of it is some of its autos, but some commercial real estate. We're big in commercial real estate, we [have] got to get that down as a whole. And what this does is provide - we were talking moments ago about the macro economy, there's some challenges with inflation. There's actually some big positives with the scale of investment that's required right at the heart of this economy. If I were to roll back the clock 25 years, the level of investment was about two percentage points higher around the world relative to GDP. Actually, we're going to get that back through this process of transition that has big multipliers for growth and of course for jobs. "
2022-06-27,"Americans are increasingly turning to side hustles to make more money amid economic uncertainty and persistent high inflation.Some 44% of Americans are working at least one extra job to make ends meet each month, according to survey from Insuranks, a small-business insurance marketplace. The online survey of more than 1,000 adults working at least one job took place from May 31 through June 2.An additional 28% said that they took on a secondary gig due to inflation — the highest the U.S. has experienced in 40 years — driving up costs.More from Invest in You:Tips for having a wildly successful Amazon businessCrypto is here. Are you ready?This is why Americans can't manage their moneyThe survey found that those who work a side hustle spend, on average, 13 hours per week on their second job, and bring in an extra $483 per month. Before pursuing a side gig, people should establish their goal, whether that is to earn more money, explore a creative outlet or build skills that they aren't using in their full-time job, said Gorick Ng, author of ""The Unspoken Rules.""""There is more to life than just a single W-2,"" he said, adding that he sees people using side hustles to fulfill many dreams from financial freedom to learning new skills or having a creative outlet. If your goal is to make more money, a side hustle might not always make the most sense, said Paula Pant, host of the podcast ""Afford Anything,"" during CNBC's recent Own Your Money (… Before it Owns You) event.If your main job is in a high-paying profession, it may be a better use of your time to go for a promotion or consult within your area of expertise instead of launching a side gig that's entirely different.""Choose whatever is the most time-efficient and energy- and spirit-efficient way of earning more,"" she said. Where you are in life should also factor into your decision to start a side hustle, according to Anh Tran, a certified financial planner and managing partner at SageMint Wealth in Orange, California. For example, if you're a college student, you may have more time to devote to a potential side gig than if you're trying to start a family.It's important to consider the amount of time and effort launching a business will take versus the potential payoff, Tran said.""What are you going to have to put into it to get a return, and does that make sense for you from a financial standpoint?"" said Tran. On the other hand, if you're in an industry or occupation where there isn't a whole lot of financial upside, a side hustle could be an efficient route to earning more.""At the end of the day, ultimately what matters is the size of the gap between how much you earn and how much you spend,"" said Pant. One way of increasing that is to bring in extra income, especially if you don't want to cut spending. A side hustle may also make sense if you're unhappy in your job and think the gig could become a full-time business.""There's the common mantra of you can potentially be rich working for someone else, but you may not necessarily be wealthy working for someone else,"" said Ng.SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

2022-06-28,"Millions of California families may receive checks of up to $1,050 under a new budget deal.The size of the credit will set a record for direct payments from states.But other states may not be inclined to take California's lead. Record high inflation and gas prices have many Americans hoping for financial relief.And in California, that's exactly what approximately 23 million residents stand to get, thanks to the state's new budget deal, which is slated to give qualifying taxpayers new direct payments.Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislative leaders agreed on a $17 billion relief package that includes $9.5 billion in inflation relief funds. Those estimated 23 million California taxpayers will receive between $200 and $1,050 by early next year.""Millions of Californians will be receiving up to $1,050 as part of a NEW middle class tax rebate,"" Newsom tweeted on Sunday.More from Personal Finance:58% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck after inflation spike How much money gas tax holidays save driversPandemic-era stimulus checks rewired how some see money""That's more money in your pocket to help you fill your gas tank and put food on the table,"" he wrote. Those with up to $75,000 in income, or $150,000 if married and filing jointly, will receive up to $350 per tax filer, plus $350 if they have one or more dependent. Thus, joint filers with at least one dependent stand to receive the highest possible sum of $1,050.California filers with incomes above that first tier, but less than $125,000 in income if single or $250,000 if married and filing jointly, may receive $250 per filer, plus another $250 if they have at least one dependent.Those with incomes above that second tier but below another set of thresholds — individuals with less than $250,000 in income, or $500,000 if filing jointly — may receive $200 per filer, plus another $200 if they have any dependents. Those with incomes above that third tier would not be eligible for rebates.""It seems that what everybody wants from their state lawmakers right now is help reconciling and addressing the fact that many families are really struggling with inflation and other pressures while state budgets and corporate profits are doing very well,"" said Dylan Grundman O'Neill, senior state policy analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.California's proposal is a ""pretty good example"" of reconciling that by delivering help to the families who most need it, he said, with the highest payments concentrated on the first income tier. Other states, such as Maine, New Jersey and New Mexico, have also made efforts to provide direct relief payments to residents, according to O'Neill.Moreover, many states are in talks to implement gas tax holidays, and some have already temporarily suspended those levies.Sending direct checks is a better way of acknowledging that people are struggling in different ways, O'Neill said. But the Golden State's move is unlikely to inspire other states to follow, at least for now. One reason for that is most states are done with their legislative sessions for this year.California's payments will set a new standard because of the large size of the credit, O'Neill said.California has more flexibility to send these kinds of payments because its budget is one of the largest in dollar terms and they have the biggest surplus on record of any state, he said.""They have a highly progressive tax code that is bringing in a lot of revenue from the profitable corporations and wealthy individuals that are doing the best in this economy right now,"" O'Neill said."

""They're telling you they've slowed investment, their new projects have actually slowed."" Unsold goods piled up, except in autos. Orders for domestic consumption and overseas export mostly fell in the second quarter from the first. Orders for textiles and chemicals processing were among the hardest-hit.The only standout domestically was IT and consumer electronics, which saw orders rise during that time. Orders for export grew in three of seven manufacturing categories: electronics, automotive and food and beverage processing. ""Weak domestic orders and expanding inventories indicate the presumed second-half improvement will be unpleasantly modest,"" the report said.The authors noted the services sector saw the greatest reversal.

But Powell said that it's also important to arrest inflation expectations over the longer term, so they don't become entrenched and create a self-fulfilling cycle.""There's a clock running here, where we have inflation running now for more than a year,"" he said. ""It would be bad risk management to just assume those longer-term inflation expectations would remain anchored indefinitely in the face of persistent high inflation.

A measure of the outlook over the next five years that compares inflation-indexed government bonds to standard Treasurys fell from nearly 3.6% in late March to 2.73% this week.However, other surveys show that consumers expect prices to continue to climb. One such measure, from the University of Michigan, helped pressure the Fed into raising its benchmark interest rate 0.75 percentage point at its meeting earlier this month.The Fed now is charged with bringing down those expectations while not crashing the economy. Powell said he's confident that will happen, though he acknowledged the risks ahead.""We're strongly committed to using our tools to get inflation to come down. The way to do that is to slow down growth, ideally keeping it positive,"" he said. ""Is there a risk that would go too far? Certainly, there's a risk.

About 85% of that increase came from non-residents, as border restrictions were progressively lifted and employers backfilled vacancies for jobs that are more reliant on migrant workers.""With the significant relaxation of border restrictions, we expect the non-resident workforce to continue to recover, catching up with the strong resident employment growth over the past two years. This will provide some relief to the current labor market tightness,"" the manpower ministry said in the release of the first quarter figures.  ""At the same time, the deterioration of the external economic environment, due in part to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has weakened the demand outlook for some of our outward-oriented sectors,"" it added.  The minister said that as border restrictions continue to be relaxed, more foreign workers are returning to Singapore, which would ease the labor crunch in some sectors, especially construction.In May, the CEO of real estate company PropertyGuru Hari Krishnan highlighted that the construction sector was largely shut for around two years because of a lack of manpower, though the industry started to recover in 2021.

2022-06-30,"In this very confusing and unusual macroeconomic environment, I offer one piece of advice: just follow the labor market. We can't be in a recession if the labor market is strong, no matter what the GDP number is. And we also can't beat inflation and have the Fed back off tightening until the labor market cools significantly.  It does not matter if ""real"" GDP ends up negative in the first and second quarter of this year, in terms of the business cycle. Those reads look terrible because of inflation, not because of weak demand. Nominal GDP has been surging for almost two years now, to such a degree that it's outpacing the economy's capacity and resulting in higher prices instead of greater real output. Real GDP is tanking because the economy has been overheating.  The clearest evidence of this is in the labor market. We added 1.6 million jobs in the first quarter, while inflation-adjusted ""real"" GDP declined by an annualized 1.6%. Normally in true economic downturns, we are shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. Instead, even in April and May hiring has proven remarkably strong, with gains of around 400,000 per month--stronger than almost any months we'd seen in the entire expansion before the pandemic hit.  And all of this has occurred while the Fed has sucked a massive amount of liquidity and wealth out of the financial system; $8.5 trillion from the S&P 500 since January, and a couple trillion more from crypto. And yet what did we learn this morning? Weekly new jobless claims actually fell last week, to 231,000--a historically healthy and normal level. Nothing here suggests the layoffs we've started to see in tech and crypto are emblematic of a broader labor market slowdown.  And we actually need a labor market slowdown to finally stop the economic overheating that's resulted in price spikes, supply shortages, and labor issues that are crippling the travel sector now as it was supposed to have its best summer ever. Inflation in 2023 will not be a story of commodity prices, but the cost of services-- especially essential, unavoidable services like healthcare, where labor costs are fast accelerating.  Inflation in that sense risks becoming more pernicious, more regressive, and less obvious to the naked eye than in food and energy costs if it continues to spread throughout the service sector on the back of the tight labor market. Remember, we still have more than 11 million job openings against six million unemployed workers. Fed Chair Powell is basically trying to destroy openings (instead of actual jobs),  in an effort to slow the wage gains that are pushing up the cost of everything. The distinction might seem subtle, but there's a huge difference in getting wage pressures to fall to around 4% from the upwards-of-5% figures we've been seeing in the first half of the year. Four percent puts us more on track to hit the Fed's inflation target, and suggests the economy is normalizing. Still, it won't be the readings this month or next that settle the issue, but rather where we are three to six months out.  In a nutshell: jobless claims, job openings, hours worked, average hourly earnings...these are the most critical business-cycle metrics to follow in the back half of 2022. Beating inflation has to mean some kind of labor market slowdown (or else it will require even more Fed tightening), and the magnitude of the slowdown will be the real tell on the recession question in the months ahead.  As a side note, it makes sense that ADP, which issues its own monthly private-sector jobs report, is taking this moment to halt releases in order to ""retool"" its survey, which has a woeful track record in predicting the official jobs release from the U.S. government. With so much at stake on the labor market, it's a make-or-break moment for the company to determine the best usage of its own data, or risk irrelevance.  So yes, it was encouraging to see smaller monthly increases in the Fed's preferred inflation gauge this morning, and the reset of commodity prices and inflation breakevens since late spring. But now, it's up to the labor market to fill in the rest of the story. See you at 1 p.m!KellyTwitter: @KellyCNBCInstagram: @realkellyevans"
2022-07-01,"The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow gauge sees the second-quarter running at negative 2.1%.Coupled with the first-quarter's decline of 1.6%, that would fit the technical definition of recession. A Federal Reserve tracker of economic growth is pointing to an increased chance that the U.S. economy has entered a recession.Most Wall Street economists have been pointing to an increased chance of negative growth ahead, but figure it won't come until at least 2023.However, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow measure, which tracks economic data in real time and adjusts continuously, sees second-quarter output contracting by 2.1%. Coupled with the first-quarter's decline of 1.6%, that would fit the technical definition of recession.""GDPNow has a strong track record, and the closer we get to July 28th's release [of the initial Q2 GDP estimate] the more accurate it becomes,"" wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.The tracker took a fairly precipitous fall from its last estimate of 0.3% growth on June 27. Data this week showing further weakness in consumer spending and inflation-adjusted domestic investment prompted the cut that put the April-through-June period into negative territory.One big change in the quarter has been rising interest rates. In an effort to curb surging inflation, the Fed has jacked up its benchmark borrowing rate by 1.5 percentage points since March, with more increases likely to come through the remainder of the year and perhaps into 2023.Fed officials have expressed optimism that they'll be able to tame inflation without sending the economy into recession. However, Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week said getting inflation down is the paramount job now. At a panel discussion earlier this week presented by the European Union, Powell was asked what he would tell the American people about how long it will take for monetary policy to tackle the surging cost of living.He said he would tell the public, ""We fully understand and appreciate the pain people are going through dealing with higher inflation, that we have the tools to address that and the resolve to use them, and that we are committed to and will succeed in getting inflation down to 2%. The process is highly likely to involve some pain, but the worse pain would be from failing to address this high inflation and allowing it to become persistent.""Whether that turns into recession is unknown. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of recessions and expansions, notes that two consecutive quarters of negative growth isn't necessary for a recession to be declared. However, since World War II there never has been an instance where the U.S. contracted in consecutive quarters and was not in recession.To be sure, this tracker can be volatile and swing with every data release. However, Colas noted that the GDPNow model gets more accurate as the quarter progresses.""The model's long-run track record is excellent,"" he said. ""Since the Atlanta Fed first started running the model in 2011, its average error has been just -0.3 points. From 2011 to 2019 (excluding the economic volatility around the pandemic), its tracking error averaged zero.""He further noted that U.S. Treasury yields have taken note of the slower growth prospects, falling significantly over the past two weeks.""Stocks have taken no comfort from the recent decline in yields because they see the same issue portrayed in the GDPNow data: a US economy that is rapidly cooling,"" Colas added.— This story has been updated to reflect a downward revision Friday afternoon from the Atlanta Fed."

David Dodwell, the chief executive officer of Strategic Access, a consultancy firm, said Hong Kong's new leader faced many challenges.""The first priority is security and stability, no question about it,"" Dodwell told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Friday.""The country as a whole and Hong Kong in particular, were really traumatized by the six months of street chaos in 2019. And very, very clearly, Beijing would not welcome that happening,"" Dodwell said, adding that the government will also have to deliver on housing. The new chief executive's biggest challenge lay in reinventing Hong Kong's appeal, said Tara Joseph, senior director at business risk consultancy, Strategy Risks, who recently left the city after living there for 20 years.

""Hong Kong always has an opportunity to be a win-win if it remains connected and open to the world, because everybody wants business to happen. China wants business to happen,"" Joseph said. ""The U.S. and other Western nations [also] want to be able to have capital and movement into China.""However, the administration of outgoing Chief Executive Carrie Lam may have ""completely underestimated the unintended consequences [of] so-called integration"" with the mainland, said Bernard Chan, former convener of Hong Kong's executive council under Lam.""There are a lot of unintended consequences.

The new administration will also have to focus on housing, said Chan.""A housing shortage has always been a big issue in Hong Kong.

There is a chance some of those cracks in the labor market could start to appear on Friday. Some slowing would be seen as a positive, but there's a balance between a slower, less hot job market and one that has gotten too cool.""Employment should slow from May.

""It starts with something as amorphous as market sentiment. The market sentiment starts to evaporate. ...That's when financial conditions start to tighten. ... That has a knock on to economic activity.""Economists are divided on when and whether the economy will enter a recession, but increasingly markets are pricing in an economic contraction.The Atlanta Fed's GDP Now tracker shows the economy is already in a recession, with a forecast of gross domestic product declining 2.1% in the second quarter. If that forecast were accurate, it would make for a second negative quarter in a row, or what's considered a recession on Wall Street. The first quarter contracted by 1.6%.Other economists, however, are not forecasting a recession for the current period, and Page sees 1.5% growth in the second quarter.New test for stocks?Stocks in the past week were sharply lower, as Treasury yields also fell on recession expectations. The 10-year yield stood at 2.89% on Friday, tumbling from 3.49% just two weeks ago. Some strategists had expected to see an up week for stocks as portfolio managers bought equities to rebalance their portfolios at the end of the second quarter.The S&P 500 rallied 1.1% Friday but was off 2.2% for the week, ending at 3,825. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% Friday, but was down 4.1% for the week. Loading chart... ""Right now, the market is trying to stabilize with some real quarterly flows,"" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Redler said if the start of the new quarter and month does not bring in fresh money and support the market in the next several sessions, that will be a negative sign for stocks and could signal that the market will soon test its lows.""I think the market is caught between two narratives,"" said Redler. ""I don't know if it wants good news or bad news. At first, the hot economic news was bad because the Fed could go another 75 basis points and keep going, but now the market wants softer news. But is the landing going to be soft or hard? It's like threading the needle right now.""Redler said he believes the market is in the ""seventh inning of this correction.""""If you haven't sold yet, it's probably not the time to do it. At this point, it's a high probability that we test the [S&P 500] low of 3,638, and then it's just a question of whether we make new lows,"" he said. ""A lot of people are focused on 3,400 on the S&P 500.""Strategists say the market will also focus on earnings season, and many expect a choppy reaction once companies begin reporting and lowering future profit guidance. Earnings begin with big banks reporting July 14 and 15.""The only bullish narrative the market has right now is it can go up on bad news,"" said Redler. ""At this point, it's just a matter of how long this contraction will go that the Fed started. They wanted this.""Week ahead calendarMondayJuly Fourth holidayMarkets closedTuesday10:00 a.m. May factory ordersWednesday9:00 a.m. New York Fed President John Williams9:45 a.m. S&P Global services June PMI10:00 a.m. ISM June services10:00 a.m. May JOLTS2:00 p.m. FOMC minutesThursday8:30 a.m. Initial jobless claims8:30 a.m. May trade balance1:00 p.m. Fed governor Christopher Waller1:00 p.m. St. Louis Fed President James BullardFridayEarnings: WD-40, Levi Strauss  8:30 a.m. New York Fed President John Williams8:30 a.m. June employment report10:00 a.m. May wholesale trade11:00 a.m. New York Fed President John Williams3:00 p.m. May consumer creditCorrection: The ADP employment report has been stopped and will be reintroduced Aug. 31.

And when the U.S. economy was also in a fairly robust state,"" she explained. Gasoline prices have been surging close to an average $5 per gallon across the U.S. While consumers are feeling the pain, prices are not yet at a level that would tip the economy into a recession, economists predict.President Joe Biden will make make a three-stop trip to the Middle East in mid-July that includes a visit to Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest oil producers. He is expected to explore ways to bring more oil onto the global market, as the U.S. and other countries are face soaring fuel prices due to the war in Ukraine as well as post-pandemic demand. All that is driving up inflation.""I think we were still dealing with the fact of an adjustment to the pandemic meant people were more likely to drive than take public transit, and people are still taking long haul journeys,"" said Ziemba.""The fact that airplanes are starting to sort of reduce production, reduce flights… might mean some people are more likely to do road trips. I think on the margins, it costs a lot more to take those trips. And so we'll see some people who are going or staying closer to home, maybe stay patient,"" she added.""But ultimately, this sort of pain point of higher prices is gonna take some time to play in.""In June, Biden called on U.S. oil refining companies to produce more, and said they need to help alleviate the burden of high prices on consumers.""One sign I'm watching for is to what extent are we globally gonna see more refining capacity. There's been a little bit of good news there, but it's mostly been in emerging market countries adding some refining capacity,"" she said.""I'm afraid comments from the White House blaming refineries, blaming gas stations don't necessarily help solve this problem.""Russia's war on Ukraine has pushed up oil prices, which have surged 43% year-to-date.

2022-07-04,"Stocks staged an afternoon rally on Tuesday as concerns about a possible recession in the U.S. weighed on investor sentiment but lower interest rates appeared to boost the tech sector.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.75% to 11,322.24 after opening the day sharply lower. The S&P 500 rose 0.16% to 3,831.39 after being down more than 2% at session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 129.44 points, or 0.4%, at 30,967.82 but was down more than 700 points earlier. Concerns about economic growth are hanging over investors as the U.S. market looks to recover after a rough first half to the year. The market has dropped in four of the past five weeks, and the S&P 500 is more than 20% below its record high. Some economists believe U.S. GDP declined for both quarters to start the year, which is a shorthand used by many to signal a recession.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield and the 2-year yield inverted on Tuesday, a move that has a strong historical track record as a recession indicator. When short-term Treasury yields trade above long-term yields, it could be a sign that investors expect an economic slowdown to lead to rate cuts.Stocks tied to economic growth fell sharply on Tuesday, with machinery names Deere and Caterpillar falling 3.2% and 2.5%, respectively, and hitting their lowest levels of the year. Mining stock Freeport-McMoRan dropped 6.6%.""The U.S. market is all about pricing in a slowdown, and pricing in the fact that the Fed is forced to hike rates into a slowdown,"" Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian said on ""Squawk Box.""However, the decline in interest rates may have boosted growth-oriented tech stocks, helping the Nasdaq outperform. Docusign and Zoom Video rose 6.7% and 8.5%. The Ark Innovation ETF, a volatile fund that tracks speculative tech stocks, jumped more than 8%.Elsewhere, the price of oil also declined, reflecting a possible economic slowdown. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell below $100 per barrel. Shares of oil giant Chevron dropped 2.6%.Consumer discretionary stocks, which have been among the worst performers in recent weeks, helped the market recover from its lows of the session. Amazon and Nike gained more than 3%, while Target rose 2.3%. Cheaper oil prices could be a boost for these stocks as consumers adjust their spending patterns amid high inflation.Elsewhere, shares of Ford fell 1% after the automaker's second-quarter sales rose more slowly than expected.Markets finished one of the worst halves in decades on Thursday, and some on Wall Street believe an economic slowdown has been somewhat priced in to stocks.The outlook for the second half of the year is murky. Credit Suisse strategist Jonathan Golub said in a note to clients on Tuesday that he expects the U.S. to avoid a recession but cut his S&P 500 target for the end of the year to 4,300 from 4,900. The new target would mean Wall Street claws back about half of its losses from the first six months of the year.""Recessions are most accurately characterized by a meltdown in employment accompanied by an inability of consumers and businesses to meet their financial obligations. While we are currently experiencing a meaningful slowdown in economic growth (from extremely high levels), neither of the above conditions are present today,"" Golub wrote. In this shortened holiday week, investors are looking ahead to the release of June jobs report data on Friday. According to Dow Jones estimates, job growth likely slowed in June with 250,000 nonfarm payrolls added, down from 390,000 in May. Economists surveyed expect the unemployment rate to hold at 3.6%.May factory orders released on Tuesday showed stronger-than-expected growth. This week's economic calendar also includes Wednesday's release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting.On the political front, investors were watching a looming decision from President Joe Biden on whether his administration would roll back Trump-era tariffs on China goods.

2022-07-05,"Raising interest rates to tame demand and therefore inflation is not the right solution as high prices have been mainly driven mainly by supply chain shocks, MBMG Group managing partner Paul Gambles told CNBC.""Supply is very difficult to manage, we are finding across a whole bunch of industries, a whole bunch of businesses, they're having very different challenges just turning the taps back on,"" he said.""And the Fed are the first ones to put up their hands and say monetary policy can't do anything about supply shock. And then they go and raise interest rates,"" he added. Raising interest rates to tame demand — and therefore inflation — is not the right solution, as high prices have been driven mainly by supply chain shocks, one analyst said. Global manufacturers and suppliers have been unable to produce and deliver goods to consumers efficiently during Covid lockdowns. And more recently, sanctions imposed on Russia have also curtailed supply, mainly of commodities.""Supply is very difficult to manage, we are finding across a whole bunch of industries, a whole bunch of businesses, they're having very different challenges just turning the taps back on,"" Paul Gambles, managing partner at advisory firm MBMG Group, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Monday.   Referring to the energy crisis that Europe faces as Russia threatens to cut off gas supplies, he said that ""on American independence day, this is sort of a co-dependence day where Europe is absolutely shooting itself in the foot, because so much of this has come about as a result of sanctions.""""And the Fed are the first ones to put up their hands and say monetary policy can't do anything about supply shock. And then they go and raise interest rates."" Governments around the world have, however, focused on cooling demand as a means of reining in inflation. The lifting of interest rates is intended to put demand more on an even keel with constricted supply. The U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, increased its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points to a range of 1.5%-1.75% in June — the biggest increase since 1994 — with Chair Jerome Powell flagging there could be another rate hike in July.The Reserve Bank of Australia is set to raise rates again on Tuesday, and other Asia-Pacific economies like the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia have all jumped on the same rate hike bandwagon. The Fed said in a statement it opted to raise rates as ""overall economic activity"" appeared to have picked up in the first quarter of the year, with rising inflation reflecting ""supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.""  Gambles said demand is still below the level it was at before the pandemic started, but would've fallen short even without the roadblocks of Covid.""If we look at where employment would have been in the States, if we hadn't had Covid, and we hadn't had the lockdowns, we're still about 10 million jobs short of where we would be. So there's, there's actually quite a lot of potential slack in the labor market. Somehow that's not translating to the actual slack,"" he said.""And, again, I don't think that's a monetary policy issue. I don't think monetary policy would make a great deal of difference to that.""With supply shocks rearing their ugly heads from time to time, it would be hard for central banks to maintain a sustained grip over inflation, Gambles added. Gambles argued that the United States should instead look at a fiscal boost to fix inflation. ""The U.S. federal budget for the financial year 2022 is $3 trillion on a gross basis lighter than it was in 2021. So we've got, you know, we've got a huge shortfall going into the U.S. economy. And, you know, there's probably very little that monetary policy can do about that,"" he said. Gambles says adjusting monetary policies is ""the wrong solution to the problem."" Other ""unconventional economists"" — cited by Gambles in the interview — such as HSBC senior economic advisor Stephen King, have also put forward analyses saying that it's not simply either demand or supply shock that is to blame for inflation, but the workings of both sides of the equation.Both pandemic lockdowns, supply chain upheavals and the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as the stimuli governments pumped into their economies and loose monetary policies, have contributed to rising inflation, economists like King have said.""Economically, the COVID-19 crisis was regarded by many primarily as a demand challenge. Central banks responded by offering very low interest rates and continued quantitative easing, even as governments offered huge fiscal stimulus,"" King said in a note earlier this year, referring mainly to the pandemic.""In truth, COVID-19 had only limited lockdown-related, demand-side effects in the advanced economies.""""Supply-side effects have proved to be both large and far more persistent: markets now work less well, countries are economically disconnected, and workers are less able to cross borders and, in some cases, less readily available within borders. Loosening policy conditions when supply performance has deteriorated so much is only likely to lead to inflation.""Since supply is unable to respond fully to increased money coursing through economies like the United States, prices have to rise, he added. Nevertheless, interest rate hikes remain the popular antidote to fix inflation.But economists are now concerned that the use of interest rate hikes as a tool to solve the inflation problem could trigger a recession.A rise in interest rates make it more expensive for firms to expand. That, in turn, could lead to cuts in investments, ultimately hurting employment and jobs."

2022-07-06,"Job openings and voluntary departures remain extremely high, while layoffs are near record lows — conditions that are favorable to workers. The Great Resignation is still in full swing, according to economists, though there are some signs of a slight slowdown. It's unclear how long it will remain a job seeker's market, given the Federal Reserve's move to raise borrowing costs and fears of a looming U.S. recession.  Workers are still reaping the benefits of a hot labor market characterized by few layoffs, ample job openings and a high level of voluntary departures, according to U.S. Department of Labor data issued Wednesday.The numbers reveal that the pandemic-era trend known as the Great Resignation is still in full swing despite fears of a U.S. recession, though it is showing some signs of leveling off, labor economists said.""Overall, this doesn't look like a job market about to tip into recession,"" said Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at career site Glassdoor. ""Labor demand is still extremely hot, and even if things are cooling from white-hot, they're still red-hot.More from Personal Finance:Buying carbon-conscious funds after Supreme Court EPA rulingWhite House plans sweeping changes to student loan systemLuxury car buyers are shelling out more than ever""I think the question on everyone's mind, though, is if this will continue,"" Zhao added. There were nearly 11.3 million job openings on the last business day of May, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.Job openings — a proxy for employers' demand for labor — are down from about 11.7 million in April and a record 11.9 million in March. But they are still elevated in historical terms and hovering near their level of late 2021.Additionally, workers have been quitting their jobs at a near record pace. About 4.3 million people voluntarily left their jobs in May, about the same as in the previous month and down only slightly from their peak of more than 4.4 million in March. ""The quits rate was doing 100 [miles per hour] on the freeway; it slowed down but it's still doing 90,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at job site Indeed. ""It's still pretty quick, just not as fast as it was.""This Great Resignation trend has been a centerpiece of the labor market since early 2021. It's even entered the zeitgeist via so-called ""QuitToks"" on social media site TikTok and in a Beyonce song released last month.For the most part, workers are shifting to better jobs, lured by factors like higher pay, according to economists. Wages in May jumped by 6.1% versus a year earlier, the biggest annual increase in more than 25 years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Layoffs were also near record lows in May. The layoff rate — which measures layoffs during the month as a percent of total employment — was unchanged at 0.9% in May, the Labor Department said Wednesday.Before the pandemic, 1.1% was the country's lowest layoff rate. But May marked the 15th straight month in which layoffs were below that pre-pandemic record — an indication that employers are holding on to their existing workers, Bunker said. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate of 3.6% is near the pre-pandemic level in early 2020, when it was 3.5%. That was the lowest jobless rate since 1969.""It's still a job seeker's labor market,"" Bunker said. ""Workers still have lots of bargaining power.""They maybe lost a little leverage from a couple months ago, but we haven't seen a significant change there yet."" While the labor market has been a bright spot of the pandemic-era economic recovery, there are indications things may cool — though it's unclear how much and how quickly, economists said.The Federal Reserve is raising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to slow the economy and tame stubbornly high inflation. What's more, the latest inflation reading came in hotter than expected, and the latest retail sales data was weaker than anticipated, Glassdoor's Zhao said.""We know quite explicitly the Federal Reserve is trying to cool down the economy,"" Zhao said. ""One of the places that's going to happen is in the labor market.""Things might slow down as the labor market cools, but for right now we're still very much in the Great Resignation,"" he added."
2022-07-06,"Federal Reserve officials at their June meeting said another interest rate increase of 50 or 75 basis points is likely at the July meeting, according to minutes released Wednesday.Policymakers ""recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist,"" the document said. Federal Reserve officials in June emphasized the need to fight inflation even if it meant slowing an economy that already appears on the brink of a recession, according to meeting minutes released Wednesday.Members said the July meeting likely also would see another 50 or 75 basis point move on top of a 75 basis point increase approved in June.

""In particular, participants judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the next meeting.""Raising benchmark borrowing rates by three-quarters of a percentage point in June was necessary to control cost-of-living increases running at their highest levels since 1981, central bankers said.

Officials at the June14-15 meeting remarked that they needed to make the move to assure markets and the public that they are serious about fighting inflation.""Many participants judged that a significant risk now facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Committee to adjust the stance of policy as warranted,"" the minutes stated.The document added that the moves, combined with communication regarding the stance of policy, ""would be essential in restoring price stability.""However, the approach comes with the U.S. economy on shaky ground.Gross domestic product in the first quarter fell 1.6% and is on pace to decline 2.1% in the second quarter, according to an Atlanta Fed data tracker. That would put the economy in a technical, though historically shallow, recession.""Since the last meeting, economic conditions have weakened as financial conditions have tightened. What markets want to hear now, is what the Fed has in mind if economic data releases continue to signal a deeper more serious downturn without a commensurate easing in inflation,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial.Fed officials at the meeting expressed optimism about the longer-term path of the economy, though they did lower GDP forecasts sharply, to 1.7% in 2022 from a previous estimate of 2.8% in March. They noted some reports of consumer sales slowing and businesses holding back on investments due to rising costs. The war in Ukraine, ongoing supply chain bottlenecks and Covid lockdowns in China also were cited as concerns.Officials penciled in a much bigger inflation surge than before, now anticipating headline personal consumption expenditures prices to jump 5.2% this year, compared with the 4.3% previous estimate. PCE 12-month inflation was 6.3% in May.The minutes noted that risks to the outlook were skewed lower for GDP and higher for inflation as tighter policy could slow growth. The committee prioritized fighting inflation.Officials noted that the policy moves, which put the Fed's benchmark funds rate in a range of 1.5%-1.75%, already have yielded results, tightening financial conditions and lowering some market-based inflation measures.Two such measures, which compare inflation-indexed government bonds with Treasurys, have moved to their lowest levels since autumn of 2021.The minutes noted that after a series of rate hikes, the Fed would be well positioned to evaluate the success of the moves before deciding whether to keep going. They said ""more restrictive policy"" could be implemented if inflation fails to come down. Officials indicated a series of increases that would take the funds rate to 3.4% this year, above the longer-run neutral rate of 2.5%. Futures markets are pricing in a possibility that the Fed will have to start cutting rates as soon as the summer of 2023."

See here for the latest updates.  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that an air alert was announced over almost the entirety of Ukraine last night, raising civilian anxiety. Meanwhile in Russia, the Parliament has given its initial approval to measures that put Russia's economy on a war footing.Sloviansk, a city in Donetsk that has found itself on the front line as Russian forces advance, has become the focus of Russian aggression in recent days. The British Defense Ministry said the battle for the city will be the ""next key contest"" for Ukraine.The city's mayor has urged civilians to evacuate as quickly as they can as Russian forces approach the city. Yesterday, a market in the center of the city was shelled, killing two people and injuring seven others.Russia has turned its attention to capturing more parts of the Donetsk region of the Donbas, having already seized the neighboring Luhansk province. Donetsk is now experiencing heavy shelling, the same strategy that Russian forces used in Luhansk. Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Bakhmut are now Russia's key targets.  Wed, Jul 6 20224:39 PM EDT Despite a slew of coordinated global sanctions, Russia still brings in about $1 billion a day in export revenues from oil and gas.In the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, Washington and its allies have imposed rounds of coordinated penalties that vaulted Russia past Iran and North Korea as the world's most-sanctioned country.However, Russia still receives significant revenues from energy exports, according to research compiled by Gerard DiPippo, a senior fellow at the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. DiPippo found that oil and gas accounted for 47% of Russia's revenues from January to May this year. And while Russian oil production fell in April, revenues increased by 80%.""For comparison, Russian fiscal data suggests that Moscow spent $325 million per day on military expenditures in April, the latest data available,"" DiPippo writes, referencing Moscow's ability to still finance its war in Ukraine.— Amanda Macias  Wed, Jul 6 20224:04 PM EDT Spanish celebrity chef and restaurateur Jose Andres shared a video on Twitter of what he said was a food distribution point in Mykolaiv, Ukraine.""This is one of our distribution points today … line stretched around the block but moved quick!

""Under the pressure of our defenders, the enemy was forced to retreat,"" Haidai wrote.The official said that Russian forces were not able to carry out orders to advance because of ""significant losses in terms of personnel.""""During the assault on Lysychansk alone, thousands of Russian soldiers were killed and injured. In addition, Russian occupiers are facing problems with ammunition supplies, as the Ukrainian military have destroyed several ammunition depots in the occupied areas in recent weeks,"" Haidai said.Haidai was confident that Russia's advantage in terms of the number of personnel would be reduced as soon as the Ukrainian military receive more long-range weapons.— Holly Ellyatt  Wed, Jul 6 20226:14 AM EDT Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has criticized the publication of fragments of phone conversations between President Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.""I think that diplomatic ethics, of course, does not imply such a one-sided leak of records,"" the minister told reporters following his visit to Vietnam, according to comments reported by state news agency Ria Novosti.A diplomatic rift has arisen between Moscow and Paris following the release of a documentary in France in which excerpts of a phone conversation between the presidents that took place on Feb. 20 were revealed.The excepts included the Russian president complaining about the Ukrainian government, saying it was not ""democratically elected"" and Putin also saying he was speaking to Macron — who was trying unsuccessfully to persuade him to meet President Joe Biden in Geneva — from the gym.Moscow has slammed the apparent breach of diplomatic norms, despite having itself published diplomatic correspondence between Russia, France and Germany over Ukraine last November.On Wednesday, Lavrov tried to defend Russia's actions in light of the latest spat with France, saying that ""before we published the content of my talks with colleagues from France and Germany, we warned them three times that if we do not get clear explanations why they refuse the documents agreed upon with their direct participation, we will be forced to make public,"" he said.— Holly Ellyatt  Wed, Jul 6 20225:44 AM EDT The Chechen allies of President Vladimir Putin have vowed to continue fighting in Ukraine, saying they would even go beyond the country, until the president stops them.""There should be no doubt: The DPR [the Donetsk People's Republic — a pro-Russian breakaway region], Mykolaiv, Kherson, Odesa, until Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin stops us. Inshallah [God willing] we'll get to Berlin,"" Chechen Parliament speaker Magomed Daudov told reporters.Pro-Russian Chechen fighters have been part of Russia's forces in Ukraine and have a fearsome reputation in battle, being experienced in urban combat following several conflicts with Russia itself in the '90s and 2000s before a rapprochement between Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Putin a few years ago.It's doubtful that Daudov's comments reflect any official policy in Moscow. There are also Chechens fighting for Ukraine.— Holly Ellyatt  Wed, Jul 6 20224:29 AM EDT Britain's Ministry of Defense said a battle for the major city of Sloviansk on the front line in Donetsk is coming. Russian forces are advancing into the province of Donetsk following their capture of neighboring region Luhansk.""Russian forces from the Eastern and Western Groups of Forces are likely now around 16 km north from the town of Sloviansk. With the town also under threat from the Central and Southern Groups of Forces, there is a realistic possibility that the battle for Sloviansk will be the next key contest in the struggle for the Donbas,"" the ministry said on Wednesday.A market in Sloviansk was struck yesterday, killing two people and injuring seven others, the city's mayor, Vadym Lyakh, said Wednesday.The ministry noted that Russia is likely continuing to consolidate its control over Lysychansk and the Luhansk Oblast (province) where there has been severe fighting for weeks on end, culminating last weekend with Russia's capture of the last Ukrainian-held city in the province.To the north of Sloviansk, the British noted, Russia has ""committed most of the remaining available units from the Eastern and Western Groups of Forces to the Izium axis,"" referring to the route between Sloviansk via Izium, to Kharkiv in the northeast of Ukraine.""Over the last week, Russian forces have likely advanced up to another 5 km down the E40 main road from Izium, in the face of extremely determined Ukrainian resistance,"" the ministry said.— Holly Ellyatt  Wed, Jul 6 20224:20 AM EDT Russia's Parliament has taken several steps toward putting the country's economy on a war footing, with two bills being passed in the State Duma (the lower house of Parliament) that would allow the government to compel Russian businesses to supply the military with goods for the war effort.""The load on the defense industry has increased significantly. In order to guarantee the supply of weapons and ammunition, it is necessary to optimize the work of the military-industrial complex and enterprises that are part of cooperation chains,"" Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov told lawmakers Tuesday, according to a Reuters translation.A second bill, also passed by the Duma after an initial reading, would amend the labor code. That means businesses supplying goods that assist the war effort could make their employees work at night, on weekends and holidays, and without annual leave, if necessary.Both bills still need to undergo second and third readings in the Duma and must be approved by the upper chamber and signed off by President Vladimir Putin.""The mobilization of the country's economic and industrial potential to support the military is a tacit acknowledgment of significant losses incurred since the start of the invasion and approaching shortages of certain types of equipment,"" Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at Teneo Intelligence, commented Tuesday.""At the same time, Moscow could be seen as preparing to sustain its military operations in the longer run.""— Holly Ellyatt  Wed, Jul 6 20224:14 AM EDT Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said an air alert was announced over almost all of Ukraine on Tuesday night, leaving many civilians anxious after a period of relative calm in parts of the country.""Before that, there had been no air alert in the capital and some regions for some time,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly address, adding that this had left many people wondering whether Russia was planning something.Zelenskyy told Ukrainians not to ""overthink,"" saying, ""you should not look for logic in the actions of terrorists.""""The Russian army does not take any breaks.

2022-07-07," The economy is expected to have added 250,000 jobs in June, a strong number though lower than the 390,000 in May, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones.Economists say the consumer price index inflation data next week will be the most important upcoming data for the Federal Reserve's rate hike decision, but jobs data will also be key.""Overall, we're looking for a very solid jobs report. I think there's been some concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending and the housing sector, but that's not showing up yet in the labor market,"" said one economist. June's employment report is expected to show strong hiring continues across a broad range of industries, and that the labor market may so far be untouched by concerns about a recession on the horizon.According to Dow Jones, economists expect 250,000 jobs were added last month, down from 390,000 in May. Economists also expect the unemployment rate to remain flat at 3.6%, and wages are expected to rise 0.3%, about the same as May. The report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET Friday.related investing newsUber's A.I. potential is making it stand out among its peers. Here's what that could mean for its stockMichelle Foxa day ago""Overall, we're looking for a very solid jobs report. I think there's been some concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending and the housing sector, but that's not showing up yet in the labor market,"" said Aditya Bhave, senior U.S. and global economist at Bank of America.Bhave expects stronger job growth at 325,000, but he expects the pace of job creation to wind down to about 100,000 by the end of 2022 or beginning of 2023.The jobs report could provide important clues as to whether the Federal Reserve will charge full speed ahead this month with another 75 basis point rate hike, as it did in June, or slow down to a half point increase. One basis point equals 0.01%.But for now, economists are not worried about the labor market , and they note that unemployment claims have increased just slightly. Initial filings for unemployment benefits totaled 235,000 for the week ended July 2, a gain of 4,000 from the previous period.""If our [payroll] forecasts are correct they are probably going to lean towards 75,"" said Bhave. ""If you get a really bad number, they would lean toward 50."" For sure, employment is a lagging indicator, but economists are also looking to the labor market as an area of strength that should slow down to a more normal pace as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates. The question is whether the Fed will slow the economy too much, and the job market would be one place where an economic slowdown would ultimately show up in rising unemployment and slower or negative job growth.So far, the labor market is not showing many signs of weakness. Tom Gimbel, founder of LaSalle Network, said the second quarter was a record for his recruiting firm. Accounting, finance and technology are the hottest jobs.Aside from startup and unprofitable technology firms, Gimbel said he's not seeing layoffs or a slowdown in hiring. He is, however, seeing employees leave venture capital funded startup companies for positions in more established employers.""I've never seen a recession with record low unemployment...Does the definition of a recession have to change or does crazy inflation equal a recession?"" he said. ""I don't know if that's the case, but I don't see the job market slowing down any time soon.""Since March, the Fed has raised the fed funds target rate from a range of zero to 0.25%, to 1.50% to 1.75%.Economists say the consumer price index, released next Wednesday, will be much more important for the Fed's interest rate decision at its July 26 and 27 meeting. However, the payroll data is taking on more import as well. ""Everybody I talk to in sales and trading is all amped up about how we're heading for a recession, if we're not already in one,"" said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest. ""If we get a really bad payroll print or you get a weak average hourly earnings, or the unemployment rate were to go up, it would be a more active debate whether it's 50 or 75.""Cummins expects 300,000 payrolls were added in June, a number that would keep the Fed on track to hike a hefty three-quarters point.""If you get a consensus-like number, I think they still go 75,"" Cummins said. ""It seems they are so worried about inflation expectations becoming unmoored that they will err on the side of overdoing it and going into restrictive territory.""Cummins said that the CPI inflation reading may be scorching hot when it is released next Wednesday. He said headline CPI could be 8.9%, up from May's 8.6%, the highest since 1981.The Atlantic Fed's GDP Now forecaster signaled the economy could be in a recession, when it forecast a 2.1% decline in gross domestic product for the second quarter last week. It currently shows GDP shrinking by 1.9%.Economists surveyed in the CNBC/Moody's Analytics Rapid Update are forecasting a median 1.8% increase in gross domestic product for the second quarter. Based on incoming data, they growth tracking at about 0.5%.Two negative back-to-back quarters would signal a recession to many, but not fit the formal definition necessarily that takes into account a broader set of factors. First quarter growth contracted by 1.6%.Cummins argues that the first quarter should not have been negative, and it was only because of trade and inventories. ""You can't take that data at face value and say things were contracting in the broader economy,"" he said. But he said there is a slowing in the economy, and the second quarter could be weaker than the first.""The labor market is still very healthy. It's still strong but may not be robust,"" he said."
2022-07-07,"Japan has been stuck in a low growth, low inflation – and at times deflationary – environment for many years.The BOJ has reiterated its commitment to avoiding deflation, which remains the dominant policy hurdle in Japan.The central bank expects consumer price rises to decelerate in the medium-term once the influence of energy prices on the headline figure begins to wane.Should this assessment prove misguided, and the BOJ be forced to shift its policy stance, this could send a ripple effect through global markets.  Japan's central bank is nearing an inflection point.It comes as policymakers around the world scramble to tighten monetary policy in an effort to rein in record-high inflation.related investing newsGet ready for a sharp rally if debt ceiling is solved, JPMorgan tells clientsScott Schnipper19 hours agoThe Swiss National Bank was one of the latest major central banks to get in on the act, surprising markets last month by delivering its first interest rate hike in 15 years. The SNB leapt out of the blocks with a 50 basis-point increase and the shock move sent the Swiss franc soaring to its strongest level against the euro for almost two months.Japan, however, has sought to remain loose and prioritize yield curve control. The world's third-largest economy has been stuck in a low growth, low inflation — and at times deflationary — environment for many years, meaning the Bank of Japan has kept policy accommodative in a bid to stimulate the country's sluggish economy. The central bank was on track to purchase around 15 trillion Japanese yen ($110 billion) of government debt in June, rendering it the only major central bank still embarking on a significant asset purchase program.Headline CPI is running just above the 2% target in Japan, while core inflation sits at 0.8%, so the central bank does not face the same inflationary pressure as many counterparts in the West,The BOJ has reiterated its commitment to avoiding deflation, which remains the dominant policy hurdle in Japan. The central bank expects consumer price rises to decelerate in the medium-term once the influence of energy prices on the headline figure begins to wane. But, should this assessment prove misguided, and the BOJ be forced to hike interest rates – either as a result of inflation or upward pressure from other monetary tightening moves around the world – this could send a ripple effect through global markets.According to Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, much depends on the ""openness"" of the country's capital account (its balance of payments), and the extent to which flows are buffeted by changes in interest rates elsewhere.""Japan is open to global capital flows and so, as bond yields in other countries have moved up, the BoJ has found that its commitment to a policy of Yield Curve Control – keeping 10-year JGB (Japanese government bond) yields within a 25 basis point band either side of zero – has been tested by global investors,"" Shearing said in a note Monday.Yield curve control testedThe Bank of Japan's self-imposed bond yield ceiling helps to hold down borrowing costs throughout the economy, in principle supporting growth. ""The recent sell-off in global bond markets has pushed the 10-year JGB yield right to the upper limit of the BoJ's range, forcing it to purchase increasing amounts of government debt to maintain its target – by some measures, if it carried on buying at this month's pace, it would own the entire market of outstanding JGBs within a year,"" Shearing said.The Bank of Japan has continued to defend its yield target even as the global momentum pushes toward higher rates, and its divergence has driven the Japanese yen sharply downward. Shearing pointed out that while the People's Bank of China imposes capital controls to retain influence over its currency and monetary policy, Japan's relatively open capital account means it cannot control the yen while maintaining sovereignty over monetary policy.In essence, the Bank of Japan can prop up the bond yield peg by buying boundless quantities of bonds, sending the yen into a downward spiral, or it can shield the currency against a destabilizing depreciation, but it cannot manage both simultaneously. Capital Economics expects Japan to give some ground in its yield curve control by widening the target range, which could then see investors testing its resolve to hold the line at the new range. Against a backdrop of rising rates around the world, this could further weaken the yen.""Of course, a markedly weaker currency might be a positive development for an economy struggling to emerge from three decades of deflation, but large and rapid currency moves can be destabilizing,"" Shearing said.""At some point something gives – either because balance sheets start to come under strain or because imported inflation becomes a problem.""Since deflation generally leads companies and consumers to delay investments and purchases, the Bank of Japan has been working for years to return inflation to its 2% target to reignite its productive capacity and growth rate.'Violent adjustment'The BOJ's persistent quantitative easing could also have a number of significant consequences for both domestic and global markets.By capping the increase in long duration interest rates, the central bank risks pushing up inflation beyond its initial targets, according to Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Bank. Monchau noted that the BOJ buying bonds implies it would need to lend the equivalent amount, further exacerbating price rises. The divergence in yields compared to other developed countries, which are tightening monetary policy, weakens the yen. Meanwhile the BOJ keeping bond yields artificially low by purchasing so many JGBs prevents it from raising interest rates, the main method of containing higher inflation.Cumulatively, he suggested that these dynamics could create conditions for inflation to ""suddenly spiral out of control, implying an inexorable and violent adjustment in the bond market.""The maintenance of loose policy at all costs could also create risks on the international stage.""The weakening of the yen could lead to a currency war in Asia, which could, in turn, fuel rising inflation in neighbouring countries, increase the cost of servicing their dollar-denominated debts, and so increase the risks of default by less creditworthy countries,"" Monchau told CNBC on Tuesday.""Another international consequence with even greater ramifications is the risk of a sudden unwinding of the carry trade."" The carry trade is a strategy in which investors borrow from a low interest rate currency to finance the purchase of a higher yielding currency, capturing the difference between the rates. Monchau argued that with the BOJ obliged to lend the equivalent amount of the bonds it buys, this market context of ""access to very low-rate financing in a constantly depreciating currency"" favors the use of carry trades.""For example, a 'long Brazilian real, short yen' strategy has already generated gains of 35% this year. But the risk of this type of strategy is a sudden reversal of the trend in place,"" Monchau explained.""Indeed, if the yen strengthens and/or if JGB yields rise (due to the BOJ abandoning the YCC), there is a risk of a sudden and massive unwinding of carry trades, with a cascade liquidation of risky assets.""This would facilitate the panic selling of stocks, forced selling of the U.S. dollar and a spike in U.S. bond yields due to the rise in JGB yields, he suggested, the type of sudden ""financial accident"" that could worsen the pain for risky assets and heighten the risk of recession.""The bleak scenario described above is far from a certainty. First, the imbalances created by the Japanese authorities (over-indebtedness and manipulation of the bond market) have been pointed out for many years now without ever leading to a major accident,"" Monchau noted.""However, the current situation in JGBs, in a context of high market volatility, is perilous, to say the least. And any market stress due to the end of the QE in Japan may have another consequence for international financial markets: the loss of confidence in major central banks' monetary policies."""
2022-07-07,"The prospect of an economic slowdown also casts a specter of doubt over whether the European Central Bank will be able to tighten monetary policy sufficiently to rein in record-high inflation.Deutsche Bank suggested that the euro could fall into the $0.95-0.97 range if ""Europe and the U.S. find themselves slip-sliding in to a (deeper) recession in Q3 while the Fed is still hiking rates."" The euro dropped below $1.02 this week, continuing its slide to new 20-year lows and potential parity with the U.S. dollar.The euro traded as low as $1.0165 on Wednesday afternoon in Europe, before recovering slightly to hover just above the $1.02 mark Thursday morning.related investing newsHere are 3 reasons to buy gold, according to UBSFred Imbert16 hours agoThe common currency of the euro zone has been in consistent decline as fears of a recession there intensify on the back of rising uncertainty about energy supply to the bloc, with Russia threatening to further reduce gas supplies to Germany and the broader continent.The prospect of an economic slowdown also casts a specter of doubt over whether the European Central Bank will be able to tighten monetary policy sufficiently to rein in record-high inflation.Deutsche Bank pointed out in a note Wednesday that the stress points extend beyond the German natural gas shortage to the wider European energy market, as evidenced by France's EDF announcing further electricity cutbacks on Wednesday morning.Deutsche Global Head of FX Research George Saravelos suggested that ""safe-haven"" moves towards the U.S. dollar could become ""even more extreme"" as the U.S. enters a technical recession, furthering the downward pressure on the EURUSD trade.""We conclude that a move down to 0.95-0.97 in EUR/USD would match the all-time extremes seen in exchange rates and USD risk premium since the end of Bretton Woods,"" Saravelos said.""If both Europe and the U.S. find themselves slip-sliding in to a (deeper) recession in Q3 while the Fed is still hiking rates, these levels could well be reached.""One key catalyst that could reverse the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, he suggested, is a signal that the Fed is entering a protracted pause in its monetary tightening cycle, facilitating a release of some of the risk premium baked into the greenback.The DXY U.S. dollar index is up more than 11% year-to-date, last trading just below the 107 mark.Meanwhile, a ""clear peak"" in European energy tensions via an end to hostilities in Ukraine may offer a path higher for the euro.""Continued (partial) supply of Russia gas through the summer would in our view not be enough as the risks of a shutdown would persist in to winter,"" Saravelos added. The darkening outlook for the European economy comes as the ECB has announced its intention to hike interest rates for the first time since 2011, with euro zone inflation running at a record high 8.6%.Central banks around the world face a quandary as they attempt to rein in inflation without deepening economic slowdowns, which the data suggest are drawing ever closer.The Fed is already well out of the blocks on tightening, having hiked its benchmark rate by 75 basis points in June while significantly cutting its 2022 growth outlook.Minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed policymakers are worried that the central bank will lose credibility if inflation were to worsen.In a research note Tuesday, Capital Economics Markets Economist Franziska Palmas said investors across asset classes were discounting a rather adverse economic outcome in the euro zone.""While we think it would take a significant further deterioration in the outlook for the euro-zone economy for the underperformance of the euro and euro-zone assets to continue, we still expect them to struggle further,"" she said.""For one, we think gas supply in the euro-zone will remain tight and gas prices high. This is part of the reason why we expect the euro-zone economy to flirt with recession this year, even though we are only assuming a slowdown, rather than a halt to Russian gas supplies."" Palmas added that the backdrop of aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks and disappointing global economic growth will keep the downward pressure on risky assets and trigger further investor flight towards the traditional ""safe haven"" U.S. dollar.""The upshot is that while we don't expect euro-zone assets to continue underperforming their DM peers, we expect their absolute performance to remain poor this year and next,"" she said.Germany on Monday recorded its first trade deficit in goods since 1991 as the rise in energy prices sent import costs skywards for Europe's largest economy, while global trade disruption also stifled exports.The figures were among a host of data releases in recent days that have highlighted the increasingly challenging economic conditions for the euro zone. The July Sentix Economic Index on Monday showed investor morale across the 19-country euro zone has plunged to its lowest level since May 2020, which it said pointed toward an ""inevitable"" recession.""Given the nature of Germany's exports which are commodity-price sensitive, it remains hard to imagine that the trade balance could improve significantly from here in the next few months given the expected slowdown in the Eurozone economy,"" Saxo Bank foreign exchange strategists said in a note last week.""Meanwhile, high energy prices will still continue to take a toll on the trade balance as well, and possibly dampen the sentiment on EUR. EURUSD is likely to find it tough to go above 1.0500 in a sustained manner, and focus is therefore on the 1.0350 support."""
2022-07-08,"""Now is the winter of our discontent,"" a most familiar line spoken by King Richard III in Shakespeare's famous play.While the quote is often used to suggest a winter of despair, Richard was celebrating good fortune that had come to his family.However, the more common usage of the phrase may be appropriate for the coming cold season in Europe – a season the Federal Reserve ought to pay attention to as it charts the course of its own policies beyond the fall.Germany, facing the potential for very limited supplies of natural gas and other energy products from Russia, has already announced that it is likely to ration natural gas, feeding it to households first and businesses second.Europe's biggest economy may well be headed for the equivalent of a Covid lockdown if businesses cannot fuel their activity in the dead of winter.Germany is not the only European country that may be starved for energy this winter, an unforeseen consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent tit-for-tat sanctions and countersanctions between the West and Moscow. Here's why the Fed should care.A winter of discontent could throw Europe into a deep recession, an outcome already deeply discounted by markets.The Euro is close to falling to parity with the dollar – something we haven't seen since the Euro was first introduced as a sovereign currency.The European Central Bank plans to raise interest rates to combat inflation, lagging the Fed's more aggressive moves, even though the coming slowdown in Europe may well hinder the ECB's efforts.Add another problem to the ECB's list, higher interest rates will disproportionately and adversely affect the most heavily indebted peripheral countries in Europe. Italy, Spain, and Portugal are the largest among them.Can Europe and the Western world handle a European recession and another sovereign debt crisis while also trying to tame inflation? I doubt it.Further, a European recession, coupled with a continued war in Ukraine and China's slow economic recovery, will constrain overseas economic activity and gross domestic product growth in the United States.The U.S. is already likely in a ""technical recession"" as real GDP contracted in the first quarter at a 1.6% annual rate and is expected to contract by about 2% in the June quarter. (The formal declaration of a recession considers several factors beyond just GDP.) The Federal Reserve does not control overseas variables, but the contagion effect from a European recession will be a headwind here at home in an economy that's already slowing meaningfully.It's true that the latest employment report was stronger than expected as the economy added 372,000 new jobs in June. However, wage inflation is beginning to slow, and other inflation indicators in the U.S. have softened considerably in recent weeks.Further, retail inventories are bulging in the U.S., which will likely lead to heavy back-to-school. This may also lead to big holiday discounting, as well.That's disinflationary.Airfares have begun to decline, and raw materials prices have fallen in recent weeks.The Fed may well be very close to meeting its objective of bringing down demand-induced inflation and — at this point — having only a modest impact on growth and employment.Supply constraints, representing the larger input to current inflationary pressures, are beginning to ease, and they remain outside the Fed's ability to affect them.Beyond the expected 0.75 percentage point rate hike coming later this month, the Fed should be examining potential risks to the growth and inflation outlook. The next shock to the system may blindside them.Like Richard III, the Fed soon may be unknowingly standing on Bosworth Field, looking for another horse to ride to escape impending doom.Let's hope they assess their future in a less lethal fashion than the hump-backed king.— Ron Insana is a CNBC contributor and a senior advisor at Schroders."
2022-07-08,"The unemployment rate for Black women fell to 5.6% in June as the labor force participation rate fell to 62%.By comparison, the unemployment rate among white women hovered at 2.9% and the labor force participation rate held steady at 57.1%.Black workers across the board saw some of the sharpest declines in labor force participation rates for June even as unemployment rates declined. The U.S. unemployment rate fell for Black women last month even as the overall metric held steady across the board, but labor force participation also slipped for the group.Headline unemployment hovered at 3.6% in June as the economy gained 372,000 jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. That's down slightly from 384,000 additions in May, although the gains topped Dow Jones' estimate from economists of 250,000.The unemployment rate for Black women fell to 5.6% in June, down from 5.9% in the previous month. However, the labor force participation rate, which tracks how many people are employed or searching for work, slipped from 62.7% in May to 62%.It's a reversal from May's jobs report when the labor force participation rate ticked up 1% for the group.  By comparison, the unemployment rate among white women hovered at 2.9% as labor force participation rate held steady at 57.1%. Hispanic women saw unemployment tick down to 4.5% as labor force participation hovered at 59.6%.""It's hard to see from this data what is exactly behind it, but black women are withdrawing from employment much more than white women,"" said Ariane Hegewisch, senior research fellow at the Institute for Women's Policy Research.The move may signal more withdrawals from the job market and be a contributor to the downtick in the unemployment rate within the group, she said.Black workers across the board saw some of the sharpest declines in labor force participation rates for June even as unemployment rates declined. Labor force participation among the group overall fell to 62.2% from 63% in May while the unemployment rate inched 0.4% lower. Black men also saw participation fall from 68.9% to 68.1% in June as the unemployment rate dropped.Across the board, labor force participation slipped 0.1% from 62.3% in May. Asian workers saw the unemployment rate rise to 3% from 2.4% in May.Monthly jobs data continues to underscore the ongoing inequities in the U.S. employment market, said Kathryn Zickuhr, a labor market policy analyst at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Many of these issues existed well before the pandemic began, but some of those gaps are narrowing, she addedWhile the unemployment rate among white women, which held steady in June, trails that of Black and Hispanic women, those gaps have decreased slightly from May, when joblessness among Black and Hispanic women stood at 5.9% and 4.7%, respectively.  ""These gaps are real and persistent and until we address them they are going to undermine the resilience of our labor market and economy,"" Zickuhr said.While monthly changes in the jobs report highlight ongoing discrepancies in the recovery and overall employment market, Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute's program on race, ethnicity and the economy, cautions against drawing broad conclusions as results can shift with sampling.""I think the bigger picture is that all of those numbers are within the range of where they've been in the last three months,"" she said.

2022-07-08,"The number of Americans ""employed part-time for economic reasons"" fell by 707,000 last month to 3.6 million, according to June jobs report issued Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor.That's the lowest level of so-called involuntary part-time workers since August 2001, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The dynamic suggests workers have ample leverage in the current job seeker's labor market.These individuals work part-time involuntarily. They are forced to work part-time because their employer cut their hours or they can't find a full-time gig, according to the Labor Department. The number of Americans who want to work full-time but are forced to work part-time jobs declined in June to its lowest in more than 20 years, according to federal data issued Friday, underscoring the strength of the labor market and the bargaining power of workers.There were 3.6 million workers ""employed part-time for economic reasons"" in June, a decline of 707,000 from the prior month, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's monthly jobs report.That's the lowest level since August 2001, according to historical data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.More from Personal Finance:As prices rise nationwide, how to calculate your own inflation rateWhat to know if your employer changes 401(k) providers5 ways to cope with recession anxietyThe Labor Department classifies individuals as ""employed part-time for economic reasons"" if they prefer full-time employment but are forced to work part-time because their employer cuts their hours or they can't find a full-time gig.""We have seen a pretty dramatic decrease, and I think that's a very healthy sign for American workers,"" said Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at career website Glassdoor.Prior to the pandemic, the number of involuntary part-time workers dipped below 4 million just two other times in the last two decades — in July 2019 and March and April 2006, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That decrease comes on the heels of other federal labor data issued Wednesday showing employers' demand for workers remains near all-time highs, which means the dynamic is tilted in employees' favor.Job openings and the rate of people quitting their jobs at the end of May were near peak levels set in March, and layoffs remained near all-time lows. Meanwhile, wages have grown at the fastest clip in decades as employers compete for talent. ""I think this is a case where employers recognize they can't afford to just have a bunch of part-time workers, because they're going to lose them to full-time opportunities,"" Zhao said of the decline in involuntary part-timers.""If given a choice, a lot of these part-time workers will go find better opportunities elsewhere,"" he added. ""So, naturally, employers are getting pressured to offer full-time hours to part-time workers."" The decrease in June also comes as the overall labor market remains a bright spot in the U.S. economy despite fears of a recession on the horizon, according to economists.Businesses added 372,000 jobs last month, beating expectations and continuing a strong pandemic-era recovery.If the current job-growth trajectory holds, the U.S. would fully recover the 22 million lost jobs during the pandemic era in August. The private sector fully recovered to its prepandemic baseline in June, which U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh hailed as a ""major milestone"" on Friday morning. The unemployment rate also remained at 3.6% in June, unchanged for four straight months and just above its 3.5% rate in February 2020 — which, in turn, was the lowest jobless rate dating to 1969.However, it's unclear if and how long the strength will persist. The Federal Reserve is trying to cool the economy by raising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, in a bid to tame stubbornly high inflation. Central bank policymakers predicted last month that the unemployment rate would increase slightly, to 3.7%, by the end of 2022 and to 4.1% in 2024."
2022-07-11,"Chinese manufacturers are starting to see demand for consumer goods in developed economies tail off, after a strong rebound from pandemic shocks. Spot ocean freight rates between China and major U.S. and European markets are falling as consumer demand retreats. Goods demand is ""normalizing"" leading to  a significant slowdown in global growth and trade but not quite a recession yet. European sales for Guangdong-based coffee machine company HiBrew have tapered off after a sterling run last year when pent-up global demand drove up purchases of Chinese consumer goods. Sales have fallen 30% to 40% so far this year, a sharp contrast to the 70% growth in business last year, according to General Manager Zeng Qiuping.Rising living costs in the U.S. and Europe as well as importers waiting for potential U.S.-China tariff cuts contributed to the downturn, Zeng said. But he is optimistic the current lull is just a blip and overseas demand will return.While HiBrew doesn't sell much to the U.S., Zeng said fellow exporters tell him orders from the U.S. have also diminished.Separately, freight costs are starting to fall now after surging to record levels during the pandemic, signaling that demand for logistics needed for deliveries is coming off the boil, analysts say.That's good news for exporters and importers, but there's another red flag.While traders previously had to cope with supply chain congestions and upheavals, they may now need to grapple with falling demand especially in developed economies. These dynamics point to recessionary pressure, analysts warned. Indeed, spot ocean freight rates between China and the U.S. east and west coast have fallen, said Shabsie Levy, founder of Shifl, a digital supply chain platform.He attributed the declines to falling consumer demand in the U.S. and said many U.S. retailers are sitting on excess inventory. Ocean freight rates are intrinsically connected to the retail industry as ocean freight make up over half of all imports into the country, he added. ""Falling retail demand has pulled down ocean spot freight rates and continues to do so,"" Levy said. ""I would not call this reduction in demand a recession yet, but things seem to be heading towards troubled waters.""""On an anecdotal level, some customers are experiencing a drop in sales especially in certain high value items and less essential items.""During the pandemic, shipping costs surged as a result of supply chain disruptions and lockdowns.Spot ocean freight rates between China and the U.S. were nearly 3.5 times higher between January 2020 and May this year, Shifl said.  The higher logistics costs have either been absorbed by manufacturers or passed onto consumers, driving up inflation. But now, new import orders from the U.S. have slowed and businesses like Samsung U.S., the seventh-largest importer into the U.S., has halved its planned inventory order for July, according to Shifl data.The second-largest American importer, Target also announced its intentions to cut inventory orders because of ballooning inventory, according to Shifl.Even after Shanghai's lockdown was lifted, shippers received a lukewarm response from importers, Levy said.      The Drewry's composite World Container Index, which tracks freight costs of 40-foot container on major routes, has fallen over 30% since September.Costs of containers across major routes — such as Shanghai to New York, and Shanghai to Rotterdam —have dropped by up to 24% compared to last year.  ""The U.S. distribution system is stuffed with stuff. Business inventories in April were up nearly 18% from a year ago,"" Marc Levinson, an independent economist, said on LinkedIn. ""The reason for the excess inventory? Simply enough, consumers have stopped spending with abandon. As shopping habits revert to pre-pandemic norms, inflation decimates buying power, and home sales stall, the demand for consumer goods is stalling as well.""Levinson said the trend was visible in Europe, North America and parts of Asia. Economists are seeing headwinds in demand and spending.As costs of staples such as food and utilities rise, there is not much left for U.S. consumers to spend on, particularly discretionary items, Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at Citi, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""My sense is that consumers, particularly lower income consumers, are starting to crack. We are seeing that in consumer discretionary,"" he said.There are signs that goods spending is now ""flattening"" across various advanced economies, said Capital Economics' Head of Global Economics Service, Jennifer McKeown, in a note at the end of June. While consumers are still spending on services such as dining — which are making a comeback as lockdowns ease — demand for goods is ""adversely affected by high prices and by the relatively strong passthrough from higher interest rates to spending on consumer durables,"" McKeown said.  BMO Wealth Management Chief Investment Strategist Yung-Yu Ma agreed.The demand for goods faces the ""triple whammy"" — that is, shifts in consumer spending toward services, inflation straining budgets and recession concerns, Ma said.""If the economic downturn is not steep or protracted then probably by the spring of next year the supply and demand situation should be better matched,"" Ma said.""A more drawn out downturn would drag out the inventory correction even longer."" Rising interest rates won't help either, Capital's Global Economist Ariane Curtis said in another note.""Weaker global final demand for goods, due to a gradual normalization in spending patterns, lower real incomes, and higher interest rates, will be a headwind to world trade in the coming months,"" Curtis said.But she told CNBC she doesn't expect a global recession. ""We think a slowdown in trade or the normalization in demands will lead to a significant slowdown in global growth,"" she said.""It won't be back to the pre-COVID state of things given the backdrop of cost of living squeezes and ongoing supply shortages, but it won't quite be a recession either, at least not in most countries."""
2022-07-11,"Europe has been under intense pressure in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with higher energy costs pushing up inflation across the region.""Unfortunately, inflation continues to surprise on the upside, so it's once again going to be revised upwards,"" said Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice president at the European Commission.France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said over the weekend that Europe needed to prepare itself for a total cut-off of Russian gas supplies. BRUSSELS — The euro zone economy is expected to face higher inflation both this year and in 2023, officials told CNBC on Monday, while plans are being stepped up for the prospect of a permanent cut to Russian gas supplies.Europe has been under intense pressure in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with higher energy costs pushing up inflation across the region. This economic reality is unlikely to change anytime soon, with new forecasts pointing to an upward revision in consumer prices across the bloc.""What we see [is that] economic growth is proving quite resilient this year, still one can expect some downwards revision and even more so for the next year because of many uncertainties and risks,"" Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice president at the European Commission, told reporters ahead of a meeting of finance ministers.""Unfortunately, inflation continues to surprise on the upside, so it's once again going to be revised upwards,"" he added.The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, will present new economic forecasts on Thursday.Back in May, the institution projected a growth rate of 2.7% for this year and 2.3% for next year, both for the EU and the euro area.In terms of inflation in the euro area, the commission said this would hit 6.1% in 2022, before falling to 2.7% in 2023.Higher inflation could add further pressure to the European Central Bank, which is expected to raise rates for the first time in 11 years next week. France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said over the weekend that Europe needed to prepare itself for a total cut-off of Russian gas supplies.Energy analysts believe that the risk of a temporary interruption is high, particularly as Russian gas flows have already dropped by about 60% in recent months. Speaking to CNBC, Dombrovskis said the working assumption does not include a complete cut in Russian gas supplies in the coming months. However, this is ""not a risk which we can exclude,"" he said.""Clearly, we are preparing at the EU level, but also EU member states are preparing also, for this eventuality,"" Dombrovskis said.The commission is due to outline suggestions next week for how EU countries should prepare for the winter amid reduced gas supplies from Russia.Europe has been dependent on Russian gas supplies for several years and key industries rely on this commodity to work. This is the case in Germany, for instance, where chemical factories and steel production facilities use natural gas as a raw material.""What could change the situation we are in and bring us in a more difficult economic situation are supply cuts and real shortages of supply,"" Paolo Gentiloni, Europe's economy commissioner, told CNBC on Monday. Back in May, the commission said that an outright cut in Russian gas supplies would mean an economic contraction on a quarterly basis in 2022, but that annual growth would still likely remain in positive territory.""Unfortunately, the situation did not change for the better,"" Gentiloni said. In fact, gas prices in Europe saw further volatility on Monday amid concerns that Russia could soon stop sending gas to Europe via the Nord Stream 1.The pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, was closed from Monday until July 21 for annual summer maintenance. It has stoked fears that Moscow may not restart supplies once the works are concluded.A spokesperson for Germany's Economy Ministry said it is difficult to predict what Russia will do after that date, according to Reuters. Ireland's Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told CNBC that a permanent cut to Russian gas supplies poses a ""significant risk.""""It is of course a concern and it is something that we are monitoring very actively,"" Donohoe said, pointing out that 12 EU economies were currently being affected by fewer gas supplies.""Steps are being taken in the short term in terms of building up our capacity for gas storage. And then in the medium term regarding alternative sources of energy other than imported gas. So, we recognize that as a significant risk, but we have done this now for some time,"" he said. The Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine shed further light on Europe's reliance on Russian fossil fuels.The commission has a plan to stop this dependency but doing so could come with hefty costs as governments invest in other energy production sources and look to make deals with other gas exporters.In June, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Russian gas imports were down by 33% over a 12-month period."
2022-07-11,"Johnson formally resigned as leader of the Conservative Party on Thursday, but said he would stay at Downing Street until a successor is chosenThe prime minister's ousting coincides with a particularly perilous period for the U.K. economy. Inflation hit a new 40-year high of 9.1% in May and the country is facing a cost-of-living crisis.""The immediate outlook is likely to hinge on whether Johnson manages to stay on for the next two months – in which case markets risk a period of additional volatility going into the summer,"" AXA IM's Adegbembo said. LONDON — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's eventual successor is likely to bring forth greater fiscal support and less-fractious relations with the European Union, according to economists.Johnson formally resigned as leader of the Conservative Party on Thursday, but said he would stay at Downing Street until a successor is chosen — despite many calling for him to step aside immediately and allow a less controversial ""caretaker"" to take over in the interim.Exactly when a new leader will be appointed is unclear, but reports suggest the aim is to have one confirmed before the Conservative Party conference in October. By Monday morning, 11 hopefuls had entered the race to replace Johnson with Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt and Liz Truss the favorites, according to the U.K. bookmakers.The prime minister's ousting coincides with a particularly perilous period for the U.K. economy. Inflation hit a new 40-year high of 9.1% in May as soaring food and energy costs deepened the country's cost-of-living crisis.Meanwhile the economy unexpectedly shrank in April to mark the first consecutive GDP contractions since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic — and the U.K. is widely tipped to experience a technical recession in the second half of the year. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the U.K.'s independent fiscal body, has projected that real disposable incomes will fall by 2.2% this financial year (2022/2023), the largest annual decline since records began, as the squeeze in household spending power persists.""Additionally, the uncertainty around the duration and outcome of the conflict in Ukraine is likely to adversely affect investments, as well as export performance via secondary effects on the growth outlook for the EU, the U.K.'s key trading partner,"" said Boris Glass, senior U.K. economist at S&P Global Ratings.""Given the aforementioned inflation squeeze, the Bank of England's (BOE's) tightening of monetary policy, and no end in sight to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we project 1% growth for the U.K. for 2023, the lowest rate among G-7 countries.""Fiscal supportFormer Finance Minister Sunak, whose resignation was one of two which triggered the eventual end of Johnson's tenure, announced a series of measures over the last six months in an effort to combat the cost-of-living crisis, including a windfall tax on oil and gas majors and a one-off payment to 8 million of the lowest-income households.However, economists broadly expect whichever candidate takes the reins from Johnson to up the ante on fiscal support for the ailing economy.Modupe Adegbembo, G-7 economist at AXA Investment Management, said a key question is whether Johnson uses his ""caretaker"" period as prime minister — should he be granted one — to push through short-term fiscal policies.""However, when a new Prime Minister is appointed, we see an increased likelihood of additional fiscal spending and/or tax cuts,"" Adegbembo said in a note Thursday.""The potential to accelerate income tax cuts penciled in for 2024 may be floated by some candidates, although remains challenging in the light of public finance developments."" Her comments were echoed by strategists at UBS, who said a change in leadership makes further fiscal support more likely as a new prime minister will ""want to prove themselves.""""Any additional support for the U.K. economy would come at an opportune moment: The GDP growth estimate for March was –0.1% compared to February, and for April it was –0.3% versus March,"" UBS CIO Mark Haefele's team said in a note Friday.""Another increase to the energy price cap means there is further pressure ahead, but while our base case is that the U.K. will narrowly escape recession, it is important to remember that the FTSE 100 generates just 25% of its revenues inside the U.K.""As such, U.K. large-cap stocks are not particularly sensitive to domestic economic growth, and benefit from weakness of the pound; many FTSE 100 companies make profits in dollars which are therefore strengthened when the pound weakens against the greenback.Strategists at asset manager Invesco agreed, highlighting that as long as sterling remains weak, investors may have opportunities to pick up ""high-quality, international companies at a double discount.""Sterling rose fractionally after Johnson's resignation but gave back those gains and then some on Friday as global pressures continued to weigh on the pound. The FTSE 100 has remained largely impervious to the political turmoil, tracking gains across Europe.UBS also noted that high exposure to both commodity-linked and ""value"" sectors – stocks which typically trade at a discount relative to their fundamentals – has supported the U.K. market of late and rendered it one of the Swiss bank's preferred equity markets. ""The immediate outlook is likely to hinge on whether Johnson manages to stay on for the next two months – in which case markets risk a period of additional volatility going into the summer,"" AXA IM's Adegbembo said.""However, if Johnson were replaced by another 'caretaker', the prospect of domestic policymaking would fall, something which should reduce any expected volatility.""The Brexit problemNo clear front-runner has emerged to take over as leader of the Conservatives, with the field likely to be crowded and diverse. However, even once a new prime minister moves into Downing Street, the approval of any fiscal package to help consumers is not a foregone conclusion.Invesco suggested that this uncertainty means the U.K. economy will continue to ""wither"" in the interim, and is most likely among developed economies to experience a recession this year.Along with the global pressures of supply chain problems and the war in Ukraine, the U.K. is also dealing with the trade and economic fallout from Brexit, which Invesco's multi-asset team said was fueling the inflationary fire on food and energy bills.""It's hard to turn more constructive on the U.K. economy right now. Not only are economic fundamentals weakening, but the profound risk of a policy error is significant,"" Invesco strategists said. ""Given the current pressures, we think it's become even harder for the government to unify around a clear strategy going forward.""Despite being elected in 2019 on a promise to ""Get Brexit Done"" and touting his ""oven-ready"" exit deal with the European Union, Johnson's government has continued to wrangle with Brussels over the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol, a key tenet of the withdrawal agreement signed by both parties.S&P Global's Glass suggested that a new government may try to repair relations with the EU by taking a more conciliatory approach to trade relations, but this outcome is far from guaranteed given the breadth of views within the Conservative Party.""Judging by the early line-up of potential successors to Johnson, the balance of potential outcomes would tilt towards less strained relations with the EU,'' said Berenberg Senior Economist Kallum Pickering.""Even the ardent Brexiteer candidates (Penny Mordaunt and Liz Truss) are less of the populist variety than Johnson.""Cause for long-term optimism?Over time, less-fraught relations with the EU may also prove to be a catalyst for stronger business investment, offering a sustained path higher for sterling toward fair value of 1.40-1.45 against the dollar and 1.20-1.25 against the euro, Pickering suggested.""Looking further out, a Conservative leadership election followed by a snap election during the new leader's honeymoon phase is not unthinkable for late-2022 or early-2023. Both Johnson and May took the UK to the polls soon after becoming Conservative leader,"" he added.Beyond the immediate political volatility, however, Glass contended the U.K. continues to benefit from ""strong institutional settings and a credible monetary policy.""The Bank of England has begun hiking interest rates in a bid to rein in inflation, and S&P Global believes consumer prices will gradually be brought under control by mid-2024.""Moreover, despite a weakening of the macroeconomic outlook, public finances have been stabilizing overall, with net general government debt projected to fall to 94% of GDP by 2025 from 96% at the end of 2021,"" Glass said."
2022-07-12,"The U.S. and China, the world’s two greatest greenhouse gas emitters, have each caused global economic losses of more than $1.8 trillion from 1990 to 2014, according to a new Dartmouth College study.Researchers said the findings, which were published in the journal Climatic Change on Tuesday, could provide opportunities for climate liability claims between individual countries.""This research provides an answer to the question of whether there is a scientific basis for climate liability claims — the answer is yes,"" said Christopher Callahan, a Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth and a study author. The U.S. and China, the world's two greatest greenhouse gas emitters, have each caused global economic losses of more than $1.8 trillion from 1990 to 2014, according to a new Dartmouth College study that connects emissions from individual countries to the economic damage of climate change in others.The report, published in the journal Climatic Change on Tuesday, found that a few top emitter countries are responsible for causing major economic losses for poorer countries that are more vulnerable to global warming.Researchers said that climate change has saddled countries with economic losses by damaging agricultural yields, reducing labor productivity and curbing industrial output.Just five of the world's top emitters of greenhouse gases caused $6 trillion in global economic losses through warming from 1990 to 2014, according to the report. Russia, India and Brazil individually caused economic losses surpassing $500 billion each during the same period.""This research provides an answer to the question of whether there is a scientific basis for climate liability claims — the answer is yes,"" said Christopher Callahan, a Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth and a study author, in a statement. ""We have quantified each nation's culpability for historical temperature-driven income changes in every other country.""Climate-related lawsuits have historically targeted the actions of oil and gas companies rather than the liability of an individual country. However, more countries in the past few years have called on wealthier nations to pay for the ""loss and damage"" from climate-changing emissions. The U.S. has pushed back against the possibility that countries with high levels of emissions should compensate more vulnerable countries for such damage. More from CNBC Climate:How Chile is shaping the global market for lithium, a vital component of EV batteriesSpaceX Starship explosion spread particulate matter for milesWestinghouse announces a new small nuclear reactor  How Chile is shaping the global market for lithium, a vital component of EV batteriesSpaceX Starship explosion spread particulate matter for milesWestinghouse announces a new small nuclear reactor  The report calculated the damage done by a single country's emissions to another individual country's economy among a sample of 143 countries for which data is available.Countries that experience economic losses from U.S. emissions have warmer temperatures and are poorer than the global average, according to the study. They are generally located in the global South or the tropics.For instance, the U.S. from 1990 to 2014 cost Mexico a total of $79.5 billion of economic losses with respect to emissions generated from U.S. territory, according to the study. The U.S. also cost the Philippines $34 billion in economic losses.Conversely, emissions produced by the U.S. had a positive economic impact on countries like Canada and Russia, contributing to gains of $247 billion and 341 billion, respectively, according to the analysis.The study said countries that have benefited from U.S. emissions have cooler temperatures and are wealthier than the global average. These countries are typically located in the North or middle latitudes. Warmer temperatures, in some cases, can help increase output by boosting crop yields.The distribution of the impact on climate change is also unequal, as the top 10 emitting countries have caused more than two-thirds of global losses.""This research provides legally valuable estimates of the financial damages individual nations have suffered due to other countries' climate-changing activities,"" said Justin Mankin, an assistant professor of geography and senior researcher on the study, in a statement.""The responsibility for the warming rests primarily with a handful of major emitters, and this warming has resulted in the enrichment of a few wealthy countries at the expense of the poorest people in the world,"" Mankin said."
2022-07-12,"While experts debate whether a recession will happen or when, most people are already convinced we're headed for a downturn, a recent survey finds.High inflation is one of the biggest risk factors that make people think an economic decline is coming, along with high housing and rent prices and rising interest rates.There are steps you can take to reduce your costs, particularly when it comes to your personal interest rates, one expert says. Experts are weighing the odds as to how likely a recession is and how fast it could come upon us.Most Americans — 70% — already believe an economic downturn is on its way, according to a new survey from MagnifyMoney. The online survey was conducted between June 10 and 14 and included 2,082 respondents.A recession is defined as a significant economic decline that lasts more than a few months.The biggest recession warning sign, which 88% of respondents pointed to, is high inflation.Respondents also reported seeing signs of an economic downturn in housing and rent prices, with 61%; rising interest rates, 56%; the stock market, 55%; declines in consumer spending, 42%; and rising unemployment, 36%.Some of those perceptions may lean on how people feel about the economy, rather than hard numbers. While the U.S. economy still has bright spots — including a strong overall job market and rising wages — higher prices have raised Americans' feelings of financial insecurity, according to Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, which owns MagnifyMoney.""When something as fundamental to people's every day lives as gas prices and grocery bills goes sky high, it really has a huge impact on the way people look at things,"" Schulz said. Forthcoming inflation data could further fuel consumer's feelings of concern.The Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change in prices over time for certain goods and services, climbed 8.6% in May from the previous year, the highest increase since 1981.New data for June is slated to be released on Wednesday.""We expect the headline number, which includes gas and food, to be highly elevated, mainly because gas prices were so elevated in June,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a Monday press briefing.However, those June numbers are already out of date because energy prices have since fallen substantially, she said.""The President's number one economic priority is tackling inflation,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""And looking ahead, there are a number of reasons why we expect those high prices to ease over the coming months."" The biggest worry people citied about a looming recession is the inability to pay their bills, with 44%, according to the MagnifyMoney survey.In order to prepare for a downturn, many are focused on keeping their spending in line — 62% of respondents said they are cutting back on spending, while 39% are sticking to a budget. Those steps can be important in the event of a job loss or other financial setback, experts say. Others are building emergency savings, with 26%.MagnifyMoney respondents also reported taking steps to shore up their income streams, with 24% working a side gig and 6% improving job performance. Another 6% reported adjusting their investment portfolio.Meanwhile, 11% of respondents said they are doing nothing. There are proactive steps individuals can take now to get themselves in a better financial position, according to Schulz.One in 4 respondents in the MagnifyMoney survey reported paying down debt as a way to get their finances ready for an economic downturn. As the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, people may want to consider their options to control their personal interest rates on their debts, he said.More from Personal Finance:65% of Americans earning $100,000 or more are 'very concerned' about inflation5 steps you can take now to financially prepare for a recession3 ways to deal with inflation, rising rates and your creditFor those with good credit, a 0% transfer credit card can by ""very, very helpful,"" Schulz said.For those who don't have good credit, a low interest personal loan may help reduce the interest you're paying on your balances.By calling the issuer for a current credit card, you may be able to negotiate a lower rate. That has worked for about 70% of people who have asked in the past year, according to Schulz.""Any of those moves can reduce your rates significantly more than the amount that the Fed is raising them by on a monthly basis, so it can be a really significant thing,"" Schulz said."
2022-07-12,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki agreed on Tuesday to further strengthen bilateral ties and work together to address rising food and energy prices exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine. They said the war had increased exchange rate volatility, which could have adverse implications for economic and financial stability, and pledged to ""cooperate as appropriate"" on currency issues in line with their commitments as part of the Group of Seven (G7) and Group of 20 economies.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki agreed on Tuesday to further strengthen bilateral ties and work together to address rising food and energy prices exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine.They said the war had increased exchange rate volatility, which could have adverse implications for economic and financial stability, and pledged to ""cooperate as appropriate"" on currency issues in line with their commitments as part of the Group of Seven (G7) and Group of 20 economies.""We will continue to consult closely on exchange markets and cooperate as appropriate on currency issues, in line with our G7 and G20 commitments,"" the two sides said in a joint statement following their meeting.The two leaders also said they were united in their ""strong condemnation of Russia's unprovoked, unjustifiable, and illegal war against Ukraine,"" adding they continued to increase Russia's cost of its war by implementing economic and financial sanctions.Russia has described the invasion of Ukraine ""a special military operation.""Yellen and Suzuki also urged China and other non-Paris Club creditors to cooperate ""constructively"" in working out debt treatments for low-income countries facing debt distress, while also touching on issues such as climate change and global tax reforms. Their joint statement also referred to a price cap on Russian oil that the United States has proposed to prevent Moscow from benefiting from using higher oil prices to fund its war in Ukraine, but stopped short of laying out any concrete agreement on a scheme.""We welcome G7 efforts to continue exploring ways to curb rising energy prices, including the feasibility of price caps where appropriate, while considering mitigation mechanisms to ensure that most vulnerable and impacted countries maintain access to energy markets,"" the two leaders said in the statement. The global price of oil could surge by 40% to around $140 per barrel if a proposed price cap on Russian oil is not adopted, along with sanction exemptions that would allow shipments below that price, a senior U.S. Treasury official said earlier.The U.S. official said the goal was to set the price at a level that covered Russia's marginal cost of production so Moscow is incentivized to continue exporting oil, but not high enough to allow it to fund its war against Ukraine. The Japanese finance minister fired off a fresh warning shot against the renewed yen weakness earlier on Tuesday, after the currency had hit a fresh 24-year low beyond 137 yen to the dollar the previous day.""There are various global problems. We'd like to make maximum use of today's meeting to deepen our coordination to resolve them,"" Suzuki told reporters.""A sharp yen weakening is seen in recent currency market trading. I'm concerned,"" he said, ""The government will watch the currency market even more closely while liaising with the Bank of Japan.""

2022-07-14,"In May, the European Commission expected inflation in the euro area to hit 6.1% in 2022, before falling to 2.7% in 2023. Now, both forecasts have been revised up to 7.6% and 4%, respectively.For Europe as a whole, the inflation forecasts have been revised up from 6.8% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023, to 8.3% and 4.6% respectively. Many economists are pricing in a recession for the euro zone either later this year or in 2023, but — for now at least — European officials are refusing to talk about the possibility of a recession. Inflation will hit 7.6% in the euro zone and 8.3% in Europe this year, according to revised forecasts, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine puts a dampener on the region's economies.Thursday's forecasts from the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, come as markets monitor inflation prints closely. In the U.S., the consumer price index rose 9.1% on the year in June, according to numbers released Wednesday — coming in much higher than economists had expected.Concerns over record-high price rises are also widespread in Europe, where the latest reading showed that inflation hit a record rate of 8.6% in the euro zone in June.The situation is piling pressure both on national governments, which are trying to reduce the impact of higher prices on households, and the European Central Bank, which is due to meet next week.Back in May, the European Commission said it expected inflation in the euro area to hit 6.1% in 2022, before falling to 2.7% in 2023. Now, both forecasts have been revised up to 7.6% and 4%, respectively.For Europe as a whole, the inflation forecasts have been revised up from 6.8% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023, to 8.3% and 4.6% respectively.""Moscow's actions are disrupting energy and grain supplies, pushing up prices and weakening confidence,"" Paolo Gentiloni, Europe's economics commissioner, said in a statement. ""Record-high inflation is now expected to peak later this year and gradually decline in 2023. With the course of the war and the reliability of gas supplies unknown, this forecast is subject to high uncertainty and downside risks,"" he added.European officials fear a complete shutdown in gas supplies from Russia. Though the bloc has gradually been reducing its purchases of Russian gas, these imports still represent an important source of energy for the bloc — most notably for sectors which use gas as a raw material, such as the chemicals sector.Pipeline operator Nord Stream AG confirmed earlier this week that maintenance work at its Nord Stream 1 is underway until July 21. The pipeline is crucial in the transportation of Russian gas to Germany and beyond, however there are concerns that flows will not return to normal levels after the works are concluded.Speaking to CNBC Thursday, Gentiloni said: ""In a complete cut of gas scenario, there is indeed a risk to enter into a negative territory, specially within the year figure."" The commission also revised down most of its growth expectations in its summer economic forecasts, published Thursday.In May, it said it expected a growth rate of 2.7% this year and 2.3% next year for both for the EU and the euro area. Now, it now expects Europe's economy to grow by 1.5% next year, while the euro zone is seen expending by 2.6% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023.Europe has been big hard by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the year, some were expecting the euro area to grow at more than 4% — a faster pace than the United States.However, tough sanctions on Russia, a reduction in flows of natural gas, major food supply chain issues and a slew of other factors have shaken the economic prospects of the bloc.Many economists are pricing in a recession for the euro zone either later this year or in 2023, but — for now at least — European officials are refusing to talk about the possibility of a recession. Italy is once again in focus amid the possibility of fresh political chaos.One of the coalition parties in Rome has threatened to boycott a vote on a new government package and Prime Minister Mario Draghi has threatened to resign if that's the case. This could tip the country into a new political crisis and potentially fresh elections.""We like very much having as an interlocutor a government led by Mario Draghi and I think this is in the interests of the European Union and of Italy,"" Gentiloni, a former prime minister of Italy, told CNBC.The commission said Thursday that Italy will grow 2.9% this year, but only 0.9% next year."
2022-07-14,"Australia's unemployment rate dived to a 48-year low in June as hiring outstripped all expectations.Record vacancies suggested the labor market was set to tighten yet further and perhaps justify even larger increases in interest rates.With the economy essentially at full employment and inflation running red-hot, the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to keep lifting interest rates. Australia's unemployment rate dived to a 48-year low in June as hiring outstripped all expectations, while record vacancies suggested the labor market was set to tighten yet further and perhaps justify even larger increases in interest rates.Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed net employment had surged 88,400 in June from May, when it jumped 60,600. That blew away market forecasts of a 30,000 rise in June and brought gains for the year to a rousing 438,000.The jobless rate slid to 3.5% from 3.9%, well below forecasts of 3.8% and the lowest since August 1974.The dive came even as more people went looking for work, with the participation rate climbing to a record high of 66.8%.The underutilization rate, which combines unemployment and underemployment, held at its lowest since 1982 at 9.6% and implied that wage growth would accelerate over time.

2022-07-15,"China will fare the worst if spiking inflation, slowing growth and rising interest rates lead to stagflation, according to the results of a stress test of 20,000 companies conducted by credit rating agency, S&P Global Ratings.Stagflation is characterized by rising prices and slowing economic growth or high unemployment.""Now that China's growth is slowing down, they're taking a double hit, both from slowdown in growth and price pressures coming up from overseas because some of the components are being imported,"" said Terry Chan, senior research fellow at S&P Global Ratings. China will fare the worst if spiking inflation, slowing growth and rising interest rates lead to stagflation, according to the results of a stress test of 20,000 companies conducted by credit rating agency, S&P Global Ratings.Stagflation is characterized by rising prices and slowing economic growth or high unemployment.The company said over 90% of its sample was made up of unrated companies with debt totaling $37 trillion, representing 41% of total global corporate debt. The companies were categorized into four risk tiers: low, moderately low, moderately high, and high.Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia,"" S&P Global Ratings senior research fellow Terry Chan said the reasons for China's vulnerability are historical, a legacy from the years of high growth which led to Chinese companies becoming highly leveraged, or high in debt. ""Now that China's growth is slowing down, they're taking a double hit, both from slowdown in growth and price pressures coming up from overseas because some of the components are being imported ... And that's why under the stress test, they seem to perform the worst,"" Chan said.He added that the government has been trying to strike a ""balancing act.""""They're trying to rebalance the economy [so they can] strengthen some of the state-owned corporations and maybe reduce the size of the private sector,"" he said. Chan also said both business and consumer sentiment are being affected by Covid lockdowns in China. The country, unlike the rest of the world, has pursued a strict zero-Covid policy to contain outbreaks. Though it showed signs of easing such measures in May, regions with new spikes in cases earlier this month were placed on alert, facing the prospect of more lockdowns. There are other factors at play, such as China's crackdown on the real estate market in 2021 in an attempt to curb speculation in the sector, Chan said. Xi also launched a crackdown on technology companies, he added.Speaking more broadly, Chan drew a parallel between current economic challenges and the inflation problem the U.S. faced in the 1970s. He added that a recession could become inevitable, and may be a way to ""break the back"" of persistent inflation."
2022-07-15,"New demand for housing by floorspace is set to drop by 2.5% a year between 2021 and 2035, real estate and brokerage giant Beike said.The primary reason for the decline is China's aging population, according to the report. Beike does expect the value of transactions to grow slightly, by 1.8% on average a year through 2035. BEIJING — China's massive residential real estate market is only going to see demand drop over the next 15 years, sales and rental giant Beike predicts.New demand for housing by floorspace is set to drop by 2.5% a year between 2021 and 2035, the company's research arm said in a report shared with CNBC. Beike owns and operates Lianjia, one of China's largest housing brokerages.The primary reason for the decline is China's aging population, according to the report.China's population dependency support ratio — which compares the age 15 to 64 working population with the sum of those younger or older than that age range — peaked in 2010, Beike's report said.Three or four years after Japan and Korea reached a similar peak, their housing demand declined, the authors said. Real estate overall and related industries account for more than a quarter of China's economy, according to Moody's. The bulk of household wealth is tied up in real estate. In the last few years, Beijing has tried to limit developers' high use of debt and buyer speculation. However, Beike does expect transaction value to grow slightly, by 1.8% on average a year through 2035, bringing annual value to 29.2 trillion yuan ($4.36 trillion) by that time.Even with declining floorspace demand, the level in year 2035 will still remain a large 1.33 billion square meters (14.32 billion square feet), the report predicted.For comparison, about 2.2 billion square feet in new single-family homes was completed in the U.S. last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Much of China's new housing demand in coming years will likely be met by remodeling or reconstruction of existing properties, rather than new developments, Beike said in its report.Housing demand will also vary by region, with more people interested in moving to major metropolitan areas such as those around Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen, said Tang Xuan, senior analyst at Beike's research institute.

The bureau also noted the rising ""risk of stagflation in the world economy"" and tightening monetary policy overseas.At a press conference Friday, statistics bureau spokesperson Fu Linghui said economic indicators in the second quarter halted a downward trend. He described the impact of Covid as ""short-lived,"" and emphasized how China's inflation is far below that of the U.S. and Europe. Fu added that there are ""challenges"" to achieving the full-year economic targets.In the second quarter, mainland China faced its worst Covid outbreak since the height of the pandemic in early 2020. Strict stay home orders hit the metropolis of Shanghai for about two months, while travel restrictions contributed to supply chain disruptions.By early June, Shanghai, Beijing and other parts of China were on their way to resuming normal business activity. In the last few weeks, the central government has cut quarantine times and eased some Covid prevention measures.But different parts of China have had to reinstate Covid controls as new cases spike. As of Monday, Nomura said regions that account for 25.5% of China's GDP were under some form of lockdown or heightened control. That's up from 14.9% a week earlier.Major investment banks have repeatedly cut their full-year China GDP targets due to the impact of Covid controls.

2022-07-18,"The value of cryptocurrencies have been incredibly volatile, but the blockchain technology behind them is almost certainly here to stay.Many states are jockeying to lead the way as this emerging industry develops.CNBC’s 2022 America’s Top States for Business study is paying special attention to factors crucial to cryptocurrency, including regulations, mining capacity, and power costs. Investing in cryptocurrencies is clearly not for the faint of heart. The value of bitcoin has plunged from its high last fall, and others have followed similarly gut-wrenching paths.But that does not mean that the revolutionary technology behind them, which allows for innovations such as smart contracts and instant peer-to-peer payments, is not here to stay. Because of that, many states are jockeying for leadership in this emerging industry.With that in mind, CNBC's America's Top States for Business study — which scores all 50 states on a broad range of competitive features — is paying special attention to cryptocurrency under this year's methodology.Our crucial Cost of Doing Business category has always included the cost of electricity, a key consideration in this power-hungry industry. This year, our Technology and Innovation category includes a measure of each state's share of computational power or ""hash rate."" And our Business Friendliness category gives special consideration to how states are regulating this increasingly important industry.Based on those metrics, these ten states are leading the way. ""It's happening,"" Republican Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted last year. ""Texas will be the crypto leader."" He may be right. The Lone Star State is consistently at or near the top for mining capacity, running neck and neck with Georgia. Electricity is affordable even before the special deals available for crypto miners, though the state's independent power grid has had reliability issues. Texas has begun regulating cryptocurrencies with an eye towards giving them a solid foundation for growth.Mining capacity: No. 2Electricity cost: No. 16Regulation: No. 21 (tie) Mining runs deep in Kentucky's heritage, but these days the state is trading coal for crypto. Last year, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed into law a series of tax breaks for cryptocurrency mining, including extending electricity incentives that had been designated for renewable energy use to include the growing industry. The tax breaks are already working to attract miners. The state also began updating its financial regulations to encompass crypto.Mining capacity: No. 3Electricity cost: No. 13Regulation: No. 21 (tie) Virginia's Bureau of Financial Institutions has taken a mostly hands-off approach toward regulating cryptocurrency while keeping residents of the commonwealth informed about the risks. In April, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a groundbreaking bill clearing the way for banks to hold customers' crypto assets, provided they have the proper risk management tools in place.Mining capacity: No. 15Electricity cost: No. 15Regulation: No. 6 The Gem State offers the lowest electricity costs in the nation, though that has yet to translate to a big influx of mining activity. This year, the state passed the Digital Assets Act, creating a broad framework for cryptocurrency regulation. The new law specifically excludes virtual currencies from regulation under state securities laws.Mining capacity: No. 29Electricity cost: No. 1Regulation: No. 6 Low electricity costs are also a plus in the Evergreen State. Combine that with a strong tech ecosystem, and it is proving to be a draw for miners. This year, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee signed a new law establishing the Washington State Blockchain Work Group aimed at advancing the new technology and establishing partnerships between the state and the industry.Mining capacity: No. 8Electricity cost: No. 6Regulation: No. 21 (tie) The Beehive State is carefully crafting regulations for blockchain, and in March, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill that allows state and local governments to accept payments in the form of digital assets. The state also formed a new blockchain innovation task force.Mining capacity: No. 23Electricity cost: No. 3Regulation: No. 1 (tie) Low costs and smart regulation are making The Peace Garden State fertile ground for crypto, and the effort may be paying off. Last month, mining company Bitzero announced it will build its North American headquarters in North Dakota. The company, whose investors include Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary, is aiming to build an environmentally friendly bitcoin mining operation.Mining capacity: No. 18Electricity cost: No. 4Regulation: No. 4 German high-performance computing company Northern Data, which leverages its crypto mining capabilities to create data centers around the world, has chosen Pryor, Oklahoma, east of Tulsa, for its North American headquarters.

Wyoming has enacted dozens of laws to attract the industry, including a framework to charter crypto banks. The state also offers some of the lowest electricity costs in the nation.

Goldman Sachs has slowed its hiring and is looking to cut the fees that it pays vendors as the investment bank prepares for tougher times ahead.But New York-based Goldman has another tool in its arsenal to keep expenses under control: A potential return of year-end job cuts, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.Wall Street firms have long culled those deemed to be underperformers, often at the end of the year as the companies prepare to dole out bonuses to those who remain. That annual exercise was paused during the pandemic as banks furiously hired to take advantage of a record boom in deals activity.At Goldman, for instance, head count swelled by 15% to 47,000 employees in the past year alone, according to figures disclosed Monday. Some of those workers may have come aboard via acquisition, but that is still a large increase.Now, amid a steep decline in revenue tied to debt and equity issuance, Wall Street's leading investment bank is considering a return to the year-end ritual.Employees often make up the single biggest line item when it comes to expenses at an investment bank. At Goldman, the firm set aside $7.78 billion for workers' compensation and benefits through June 30, or half the overall operating expenses of the period.CFO Denis Coleman told analysts Monday on a conference call to review second-quarter earnings that the firm will slow hiring to replace those who leave and will ""probably"" reinstate annual performance reviews by year end.That is ""something that we suspended during the period of the pandemic for the most part,"" he said.No target exists yet for head count reduction, according to the person, and the plans are dynamic and could change. In the past, managing directors and partners were asked to come up with lists of those they could release if needed.CEO David Solomon touched on the topic earlier Monday in an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer.""We're always looking to add to talent to the firm,"" Solomon said. ""But at the same point, we're going to manage the growth of that going forward a little bit more cautiously given the macro environment."""
2022-07-18,"  Isabel Garcia Nevett is once again making adjustments to her business. After navigating the pandemic and dealing with rising inflation, she's now thinking about how her Miami-based chocolatier, Garcia Nevett Chocolates, can weather a possible recession. With growth for her small business linked to corporate gift giving, she's worried about cuts in spending. ""All those companies that we are hoping to do business with will be revising their budgets and won't be doing as much, and that will affect us directly,"" said Garcia Nevett, who owns the chocolatier with her sister, Susana Garcia Nevett.To address these concerns, the sisters plan to offer some less expensive options to both their corporate clients and retail clients in their shop. They are also looking at new vendors and suppliers for their packaging and comparing prices, availability and quality. Buying a higher quantity of chocolate and supplies is another way they are lowering their costs. To increase foot traffic, the business is launching a coffee menu in the shop. Garcia Nevett is not alone in her fears about an economic downturn. Fully 93% of small business owners are worried about the U.S. economy experiencing a recession in the next 12 months, a survey by Goldman Sachs. The poll of 1,533 Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Business Voice participants was conducted by Babson College and David Binder Research from June 20-23, 2022.   In addition, 38% of respondents have seen a decline in customer demand as a result of inflationary price increases on goods and services.""What we have found is that small businesses are at the tip of the spear of economic cycles,"" said Joe Wall, national director of Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices.In other words, they spot economic trends before a lot of others do. ""They don't see an end in sight in terms of things getting better,"" Wall said. An earlier CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey from May found the vast majority of small business owners preparing for a recession.Combating inflationThe past several months have brought higher prices on just about everything. Consumer prices jumped 9.1% year over year in June, while wholesale prices shot up 11.3%.  Some 75% of small business owners said that inflation negatively impacted the health of their business in the Goldman survey. Of those, 62% increased wages in relation to inflation to retain employees and 43% sought new vendors or suppliers to reduce costs They've also had to pass along high prices to their customers. However, small business owners are walking a tight line between dealing with their own rising costs and keeping their customers, with 53% raising prices by less than 10%. That's what Garcia Nevett reluctantly did when faced with higher costs, and she found her customers were understanding. Now she's holding her breath to see how the rest of the year goes. She's even put plans for a larger kitchen on hold. ""We want to see how the holiday season is going to be,"" Garcia Nevett said.  ""It is hard nowadays to really plan for the long term.""Turning to CongressGarcia Nevett is among the small business owners who are meeting with lawmakers this week during the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Business Summit in Washington, D.C. They plan to advocate for solutions to the challenges they are facing and ask them to reauthorize the Small Business Administration for the first time in over two decades. ""It is long overdue for the government to modernize the policy infrastructure that supports small businesses,"" Wall said. Through it all, business owners remain hopeful. While 78% said the economy has gotten worse in the past three months, 65% are optimistic about the financial trajectory of their business this year.""The raw resiliency of the small business community is nothing short of remarkable,"" Wall said. ""They are arguably the most creative gene pool in the country, being able to pivot at moment's notice and weather the storm."""
2022-07-19,"Oil prices edged up about 1% to a two-week high in volatile trade on Tuesday as the market focused more on tight supplies and a weaker dollar than fears an economic slowdown will hit oil demand.Brent futures finished the day 1% higher at $107.35 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled 1.6% higher at $104.22 per barrel. Brent was on track for its highest close since July 4 and WTI for its highest close since July 8.Oil prices have whipsawed, supported by supply fears due to Western sanctions on Russia, but pressured by global central bank efforts to tame inflation which stoked fears that a potential recession could cut energy demand.The U.S. dollar slid to a two-week low against a basket of other currencies, bolstering oil demand by making it less expensive for buyers using other currencies.In a move that could pose a problem for supplies, Libya's new National Oil Corp (NOC) chief Farhat Bengdara rejected challenges to his appointment and as work resumed at some shuttered fields and ports.Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden visited top oil exporter Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), whose crude exports slipped in May to a four-month low at 7.050 million barrels per day (bpd).Biden hoped to strike a deal on an oil production boost to tame fuel prices, but got no clear assurances from Saudi officials. The kingdom's foreign minister said he saw no shortage of crude in the market, just a lack of refining capacity.In the United States, expectations for an increase in crude inventories weighed on prices. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast crude inventories rose by 1.4 million barrels last week.The American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, will issue its inventory report at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Tuesday. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday.The U.S. 3:2:1 and gasoline crack spreads - measures of refining profit margins - both fell to their lowest since April.""Crack spreads continuing plunge of past four weeks to narrowest level since late April ... suggesting weakening product demand,"" said analysts at Ritterbusch and Associates, a consultancy.Early in the session, oil prices fell on weak economic data from around the world.New U.S. home-building activity fell in June to a nine-month low. In China, stocks closed lower with foreign investors dumping the most shares in more than a month. The International Monetary Fund warned that any Russian action to stop supplying Europe with natural gas would trigger economic contractions in several countries.Yet flows of gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany spiked ahead of the end of annual maintenance as the operator carried out pressure tests."
2022-07-19,"Wages in the U.S. have stagnated since the early 1970s. Between 1979 and 2020, workers' wages grew by 17.5% while productivity grew over three times as fast at 61.8%.""It's not true that wages haven't grown at all,"" said Allison Schrager, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ""They have, but they haven't grown as quickly as they had in the past.""Previously, globalization and automation have been blamed as primary causes of slow wage growth. But more economists suggest that labor dynamism plays a crucial role as well. American workers today are changing jobs less frequently than before, even though job switching leads to strong take-home pay growth.And while some Americans don't switch their jobs out of a desire for stability, others feel they can't because of limited job mobility. In many local markets, companies use the lack of competition to suppress their workers' wages.""The notion of monopsony power is that you have a local labor market, let's say that you live in a particular city or in a particular town, and in that town, there is one employer,"" explained Efraim Benmelech, professor of finance at Northwestern University. ""Given that there is only one employer there, then they set the wages in a way that is lower than what you would otherwise expect in a fully competitive market.""Sixty percent of labor markets are considered highly concentrated and just 10% more workers in an area can lead to about 1% reduction in posted wages.""In case after case, you see that government policies were implemented to discourage labor dynamism and to discourage workers from moving to a better job or moving to a better town or city to improve their job prospects,"" said Scott Lincicome, director of general economics at the Cato Institute.Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact of the Great Resignation may have led to some surprising gains in wage growth. A quarter of private sector businesses in the U.S., employing 54 million workers, delivered pay raises due to the pandemic, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.""How to tell whether that's the new reality,"" said Benmelech. ""Did it change our life forever and maybe for the better in terms of labor market and wages? We have to wait and see.""Watch the video to find out more about why wages are stagnating in America today."
2022-07-19,"Singapore's economy is ""definitely operating above its potential"" as it continues to face labor shortages from the pandemic and strong manufacturing activity, according to Brian Tan, senior regional economist at Barclays.""We have a lot of labor shortages in the economy. So considering how constrained we are in terms of supply, demand does look like it's a little bit too strong,"" he added. Although a stronger Singapore dollar is likely to weigh on export momentum, Tan said it could be ""precisely"" what the country needs to cool some of the inflation pressures. Singapore's economy is ""definitely operating above its potential"" as it continues to face labor shortages from the pandemic and strong manufacturing activity, according to Brian Tan, senior regional economist at Barclays.Although a stronger Singapore dollar is likely to weigh on export momentum, Tan said it could be ""precisely"" what the country needs to cool some of the inflation pressures that are rising from strong demand across the board, including in exports and manufacturing.""The Singapore dollar framework is exactly meant to slow down exports as the Singapore dollar appreciates relative to the policy band, and that will naturally slow down the rest of the economy,"" Tan added.After the The Monetary Authority of Singapore's announcement last Thursday that it would take a ""further calibrated step"" to tighten monetary policy in order to fight inflation, the Singapore currency jumped up almost 0.7% to S$1.3963 per dollar, with economists expecting further tightening in October. Tan said that although a strong manufacturing sector is desired, ""very strong activity"" is contributing to the country's inflation pressures as the tight labor market is driving wages up.The country has fully reopened its borders and foreign workers have been coming in, but they are being ""absorbed quicker than they are being replenished,"" with many of them being hired in the travel and services sectors. Similarly, a pandemic-induced labor shortage in the country's manufacturing sector means there aren't enough workers to keep up with demand, Tan said, adding that it is also trying to find and hire workers, ""so there's very strong competition right now."" His comments came after Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) expanded for the 19th straight month, increasing by 9% year on year last month, though it was down from 12% in May, according to official data from Enterprise Singapore released on Monday.The largest contributors to the growth in the NODX were from Malaysia, Indonesia, and the United States. Electronic shipments increased by 4.1% in June, a sharp drop from the 12.9% growth in May, while non-electronic NODX rose by 10.6% in June, following the 11.7% rise in the previous month, according to the government agency.Strong manufacturing and exports will be good for the economy, but Singapore does not have enough workers to fulfill the rising demand, Tan said. ""It may be prudent to slow [manufacturing and export activity] in order to bring the inflation pressures under control until supply can improve going forward,"" Tan added.He said inflation in Singapore will be ""key to watch"" in the second half of the year.Even though the reopening of travel borders has alleviated some of the labor shortages, Tan said recovery will be gradual.Inflation will likely remain ""quite sustained"" in the second half, and may start to cool only toward the end of the year, he said."
2022-07-20,"As inflation continues to increase, so does the probability of a recession, according to several recent economic forecasts. That means more layoffs, fewer jobs and higher interest rates may soon be on the horizon.The median probability of a recession over the next 12 months is 47.5%, up from 30% in June, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists completed last week.Recessions are officially declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which defines them as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months."" A big reason a recession looks imminent is because of inflation, which is showing few signs of slowing down. Last week's consumer price index (CPI) report revealed year-over-year inflation reaching 9.1%, the highest rate since 1981.Banks, including Citigroup, Deloitte and PNC Financial Services, previously predicted a slowdown in 2023, but recent forecasts say a recession could occur in 2022 or earlier in 2023 than formerly expected.Last week, Bank of America followed an earlier forecast by Japanese investment bank Nomura, predicting a ""mild"" recession in the remaining months of 2022. The outlook is a revision of earlier forecasts that only predicted slowing economic growth.Similarly, Wells Fargo has changed its outlook from an economic ""soft landing"" to a ""mild recession"" in the first quarter of 2023.A key factor in that revised outlook is May and June inflation data from various sources, including the monthly CPI report, says Jay Bryson, Wells Fargo's chief economist. He calls June's CPI numbers ""ugly,"" adding that inflation ""is becoming more entrenched and more widespread.""For consumers, ""it's eroding real disposable income.""In fact, decreased consumer spending is another sign of a looming recession. Wells Fargo's forecast predicts that by September there will be ""outright declines"" in consumer spending as more people dip into their savings to cover the growing costs of goods and services.""Consumers have held the line pretty well in terms of spending,"" Bryson says. ""But they've brought down their savings rates and they've increased credit card debt. Those things aren't sustainable in the long run.""With persistent inflation comes interest rate hikes, which the Federal Reserve is all but certain to do when it meets at the end of the month. The only question is whether it will be a 0.75% interest rate hike — which most forecasts expect — or a 1% interest rate hike, which Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic says is ""in play.""Rate hikes can decrease inflation by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow money. But this also discourages demand for goods and services, which can stunt economic growth.For consumers, higher interest rates means extra costs on adjustable-rate debt like loans and credit cards, higher car financing costs and potentially higher mortgage costs. A 1% hike would make these increases even more stark than a lesser increase.""We have to control inflation,"" says economist Aleksandar Tomic, an associate dean at Boston College.

The water levels in a crucial waterway in Europe's economic heartland are running dangerously low in the searing heat the region has been experiencing, posing a big risk to the German economy and more disruption to supply chains which are already under stress.""Amid a long spell of dry weather, water levels of the River Rhine have fallen far below average this summer,"" Salomon Fiedler, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said in a note Wednesday in which he warned that the German economy was ""running aground.""""The Rhine is a crucial inland waterway, on which goods are shipped to and from the industrial heartlands of southern and western Germany,"" he said, adding that ""low water levels mean that river barges will have to travel with reduced freight to limit their draft or even cease operating altogether.""As a result, the amount of goods being shipped will decline while freight rates will rise, he said, adding that ""experience from past low-water periods suggests that it is very difficult in the short term to switch from river shipping to road or rail."" Furthermore, low water levels can also affect production in industrial and power plants that rely on river water for cooling, he noted.The River Rhine is one of the European continent's most important shipping routes and is certainly Germany's most important waterway, with around 80% of inland waterway goods transport relying on this one river that passes through major cities and ports like Cologne, Dusseldorf, Rotterdam and Basel. It is particularly important for transporting agricultural products, commodities like coal and oil, and chemicals production and in previous years Germany's manufacturing sector has come under extreme pressure when water levels on the river run low.One particular gauge of the river's water levels at a measuring station in Kaub has just fallen below an officially defined benchmark for navigation, Fiedler noted.""The measuring station at Kaub sits at a crucial bottleneck where the fairway is especially shallow. On Sunday, the water level at the Kaub gauge fell below the 78cm 'equivalent water level', an officially defined benchmark for navigation, and according to the Federal Institute for Hydrology's most recent six-week forecast, water levels are likely to decline further in the coming weeks and stay below that benchmark for the foreseeable future,"" he said.Water levels at Kaub — seen as a key chokepoint for water-borne freight — have dropped throughout the week and stood at 71cm on Wednesday, data from Germany's Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration showed. A normal water level would be around the 200cm mark. Low water levels on the Rhine come at a very difficult time for Germany's economy with analysts fearing it could be sliding toward a recession as it contends with a high-inflation low-growth environment, supply chain bottlenecks and pressures brought about by the war in Ukraine, particularly in terms of energy.In the first quarter of 2022, the economy grew just 0.2% from the previous quarter, meaning it narrowly avoided a technical recession given a contraction in the previous quarter, while the inflation rate stood at 7.6% in June, weighing on domestic demand. A flash purchasing managers' index data for June also showed a darkening mood for Germany's manufacturing sector and more economic woes on the horizon.Experience of low water levels has taught us what extra negative impact these can have on the economy too; 2018 was the most recent dry year for the Rhine, with water levels reduced to just 30cm in places, making it unnavigable for larger cargo barges.This prompted many producers to resort to using other means of transport or to use smaller or partially-loaded barges, all of which pushed freight costs up for producers. Some manufacturers were even forced to halt production, increasing costs and disrupting supply chains. Analysis has been done by the Kiel Institute to measure the economic impact of low water levels with the research showing that in a month in which water levels are below the 78cm threshold every day, German industrial production is around 1% lower than in a month with no low-water days.In its 2020 analysis the institute stated that ""low water levels lead to transportation disruptions that cause a significant and economically meaningful decrease of economic activity"" but there are concerns that the economic impact could be worse this time, with supply chains already disrupted following the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine already threatening Germany's energy supplies and the increased use of larger barges (with deeper drafts) on the river.""On the one hand, Germany is most likely sliding into a recession already. This would suggest that industrial production and the need for shipping would be lower anyway, reducing the sting of low water levels,"" Fiedler said, but there are notable differences to previous water-borne crises.""Supply chains were already under heavy stress and inventories depleted after two years of pandemic-related disruption. The ability of firms to absorb delays in transportation is probably more limited than normal,"" he noted.The fallout from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has added to global supply problems – especially in the commodities markets. Given that around a third of Germany's domestic shipping of coal, crude oil and natural gas runs on rivers and canals, its waterways are crucial as Germany scrambles to replace Russian pipeline gas with coal to generate energy, Fiedler said. Robert Lehmann, an economist at Germany's influential Ifo Institute research center, told CNBC that low water levels might in fact be one of the more more manageable problems Germany faces right now.""The low water level puts further pressure on industrial production which is currently without much momentum due to the supply bottlenecks in intermediate goods,"" he told CNBC on Wednesday.""However, [the] shipment of goods across Germany is much more under pressure because of the walkout at the Port of Hamburg. As both things occur simultaneously, the effects of the low water levels might be mitigated. Overall, the effects should be manageable compared to the other, much more striking influences [on the economy]"" such as inflation or supply bottlenecks, he said."
2022-07-20," (Click here to subscribe to the Delivering Alpha newsletter.)Even if the economy faces two quarters of contraction — the traditional definition of a recession — Josh Friedman thinks it's strong enough to withstand a more serious slowdown. Friedman is co-founder, co-chairman, and co-CEO of the $26 billion credit giant, Canyon Partners. He sat down with Leslie Picker to explain why he believes the markets ""can tolerate a little bit of stress."" While a stronger economy means fewer opportunities for distressed investors like Friedman, he said his firm is prepared with ""comprehensive shopping lists of securities"" in other areas like secondaries, loan originations, and securitized packages. (The below has been edited for length and clarity. See above for full video.)Leslie Picker: I was looking back at our interview from January and at the time, you said we were at a fork in the road. From an economic and market standpoint, that prediction appears to be very prudent, given everything we've seen in the equity market sell-off, the fixed income sell-off, shift in monetary policy, geopolitical strife, and more over the last six months. It's definitely the epitome of a fork in the road. So, I'm just curious how you're sizing up the current environment, given what we've seen since we last spoke,Josh Friedman: I think we have to start by looking at where we came from. When I last talked to you, I think it was the day that the market dropped something over 1,000 points and bounced back. And my basic comment was, well, things were just too expensive. Markets fluctuate. And a confluence of recovery from COVID supply constraint and excessive stimulus both from the Treasury and from the Fed caused quite an amount of over speculation and froth in almost every asset class that you could imagine - whether it was real estate cap rates, whether it was SPACs, whether it was equities, whether it was credit markets, where you had no interest, no spread, and still had credit risk. So, it was not surprising to see a pullback from that just on its own, because those things are always self-correcting. There's always some kind of a mean reversion. But now, we're in a little different place because the Fed underestimated so significantly the more embedded inflationary aspects that are in the economy. And that's kind of the fork in the road that we're at right now.  Will there be an ability of the Fed to rein this in quickly? Will people's activities in response to the Fed's comments, cause that to happen by itself? Will there be enough demand destruction to contain inflation? Or maybe that'll happen all by itself, even without the Fed doing what it asserts that it will do. Picker: So, the fork in the road is essentially the debate that I think pretty much everybody is having right now is, will there be a soft landing or a hard landing? And will the Fed be able to accomplish the potential for a soft landing? And I'm just curious how you are looking at this from a probabilistic standpoint.Friedman: I guess my view is the Fed sometimes gets given a little too much credit for everything that happens. The Fed announced that it was going to do all sorts of asset purchases. And yes, they bought treasuries and quantitative easing and so forth right after COVID. But a lot of the measures they announced actually never were effectuated. The market did it all by itself in response to knowing that the Fed was there to protect them. And now, knowing that the Fed is going to raise rates, the market started to do that by itself. People are starting to contain demand, supply is starting to be back in a little more equilibrium - not in every market, energy markets have unique problems that are sort of unique to the supply and demand in the energy transition - but I think sometimes the markets have a natural pull toward the center. It's very popular if you're in my seat to predict a hard landing because it's much more exciting, it makes you a better guest on shows like this. But, my general view is that unemployment is only three and a half percent, personal balance sheets are actually quite good, they can tolerate a little bit of stress in the system. The banking system has none of the stress that we saw in the global financial crisis. So, I think it's not just the Fed that has to engineer a slightly softer landing, I think the market will have natural forces that pull us toward the middle by themselves.Picker: From a credit investor standpoint, this has obviously all shifted the risk profile of different aspects of the corporate capital structure. Where are you seeing the most opportunity right now? What is concerning to you, given just the recent sell-off we've seen across a lot of the credit market?Friedman: We had a sea change in the opportunity range about the time when I last spoke to you, which I think was maybe late March, something like that. And since then, the high yield market has gotten decimated. June was the worst single month that we've seen in decades, with the exception of the immediate aftermath of COVID, which was gone like that, because the Fed bailed everyone out, which they're not doing this time.Picker: And there wasn't even a recession in June, it was just the market. Friedman: Correct. And so, we've seen the equity markets get destroyed down 20% to 30%, depending on which market you look at. We've seen the investment grade debt market get destroyed, we've seen the high yield market get destroyed. So, all of a sudden, bonds that were trading at par in the secondary market are trading at 80, 85, 78, 68. And liquidity isn't great, and high yield funds that were used to nothing but inflows in a declining interest rate environment have seen an awful lot of outflows. And again, there are ups and downs to this, but generally speaking, the first area of opportunity, in my view, is just secondary market. high yield credit that dropped 20 points, and there's lots of it, And it's not so very efficient in the market today. And a lot of people who used to play in that market have exited that market for a while, or at least they're out of practice, because they've been busy originating direct loans. The second area, I would say, is origination of new loans will change quite dramatically. The banks were very eager to compete with a lot of the private direct lenders. And in their zeal to compete, they got stuck with a lot of paper on their balance sheet. So, number one, there's a process of helping relieve them of the burden of that capital at lower prices that seem to be quite attractive. And second of all, they're less likely to be as aggressive. This is how these cycles always end - they get a little too aggressive, they act as principals, and then they have an issue. But this isn't like 2008, when you had massively leveraged balance sheets, and lots and lots of paper that the banks had to relieve themselves of. This is more of a short-term effect, but it will keep them on the sidelines a bit. And I think some of the private lenders who have been buying relatively low interest rate loans, and then leveraging them to produce a return are finding that the cost of leverage is going to be a lot higher. So, we're in a very, very, very different world of origination of loans, in addition to secondary trading of bonds and loans.Picker: So, it's probably a good time then for you to be putting that dry powder to work in some of these areas that have sold off pretty dramatically, then. Friedman: I think I mentioned last time that we were just starting to dip our toe in the water. That's definitely accelerated. We've got comprehensive shopping lists of securities. And we just wait and we try to be patient. The other area where we're seeing pretty dramatic change is in anything that's put in some kind of a securitized package - whether that's car loans, whether that's personal loans, whether that's home improvement, loans, etc. - things that were trading at 6%, 7%, 8% yield could be as high as 25% yield with very quick paybacks today. Again, not an enormous liquid market, but places where you see blocks that are $10 million, $20 million, $30 million. And that's an area that's well worthy of focus right now.Picker: Distress has been an area that I think a lot of credit investors have looked for opportunities in recent years…do you think distress is going to provide more opportunities?Friedman: You know, we grew up in the distressed businesses where Mitch and I started out. Mitch was a bankruptcy lawyer. We lived through many cycles of distress. It tends to be quite cyclical. There's a difference between a distressed seller. So, a mutual fund that has redemptions and has to sell right away or someone who's got leverage and is being unwound and a company that's actually entering financial distress. I think companies are pulling their horns in. The coupon rates on the debt they've issued have been pretty low recently, the covenant burden is pretty loose. So, actual new bankruptcies? Pretty slow right now. But price depression on a lot of quality securities? Pretty good. I would also mention that the high yield index today is of higher credit quality than it was at a decade ago, there are more double B's, there are fewer triple C's, generally higher quality credit. That doesn't mean that a slowdown in the economy, even if it qualifies technically as a recession, because we have two quarters of contraction, which by the way, I think the economy is strong enough to be able to absorb. But even if you have that, that doesn't immediately mean that you're going to have a tidal wave of distress.  You'll definitely have some, what gets shaken out first of the lower quality companies that you may not be interested in at any price, but we'll see on that. Right now, we have more sellers of paper than we have buyers, and therefore prices are down between 15 and 20 points. We'll see what happens with respect to actual entering of restructurings and renegotiations of financial terms. Picker: Just to follow up on something you just said. The technical definition of a recession: two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. You think the economy is strong enough to support that? Does that negate the idea of a recession or a traditional recession?Friedman: You have some people saying, ""Oh, consumers are already in a recession."" Well, consumers are facing higher gas prices, they're facing higher mortgage rates if they happen to have a need for a new mortgage. Housing sales are down. So, in some respects, we're seeing contraction in certain parts of the economy. We're seeing inventory liquidations periodically but we're not in some awful recession. We still have unemployment less than 4%. We still have job openings that far exceed the number of people available to fill those jobs. And all I'm saying is a modest uptick in unemployment, a modest decrease in available job openings, doesn't throw the economy in anything like what we had in 2008, in my view. "

2022-07-21,"As economists debate whether or not a recession is coming soon — and how bad it will be — the fear of being laid off, or not being able to find work, might be in the back of your mind. Record-high inflation and a string of high-profile layoffs have left working professionals across the U.S. increasingly anxious about their job security: 78% of Americans are worried about losing their job during a potential upcoming recession, a recent Insight Global survey of 1,004 adults found. While it might be too soon to ""read into the tea leaves"" of such forecasts and predict when, or if, a recession will hit the U.S., ""it's very clear that we're in an economic slowdown right now,"" Kory Kantenga, a senior economist at LinkedIn, tells CNBC Make It. Even if economic growth is just slowing down, that environment can still be ""very damaging"" to employees and job-seekers, he adds. No one is immune to losing their job — but learning what skills continue to be in-demand during economic downturns can help you stay competitive in a volatile market and pivot jobs, or industries, if needed, says Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.Economists say these are the most ""recession-proof"" skills that companies will be hiring for during the next recession: Each recession looks different — during ""The Great Recession"" of 2009, for example, some people who lost their jobs in tech or finance turned to the restaurant and retail industries, Pollak notes. But during the Covid-19 recession of 2020, there were far less options to work in those fields as people remained at home. ""Every time a recession hits, the fallback work option will change,"" Pollak says. ""That's why flexibility is a really key skill to master.""To show that you're flexible, include examples of times where you've had to navigate different roles, functions or departments within a business; tackled a problem on an important project; volunteered to help with something outside of your normal job responsibilities; or worked with different teams on your resume, recommends Patrick Petitti, an economist and the CEO of Catalant, a platform that connects companies with independent consultants.Highlighting your flexibility skills in your resume shows hiring managers that you're a person who can ""operate in times of uncertainty,"" which is a critical skill to nurture even beyond a downturn, Petitti adds.""For the past 2+ years, and for the foreseeable future, we have, and will continue to be, in a period of turbulence,"" he says. ""Executives want people who can adapt quickly and don't overreact when plans change.""  New challenges will inevitably emerge during a recession — and at a time when everything is in flux, companies will look for people ""who can identify the new problems, articulate solutions and drive that plan forward,"" Pollak says. ""It's one of the top skills companies consistently hire for,"" Petitti adds. ""Even during the darkest days of the pandemic, hiring managers in tech, finance, you name it, were looking for people who can break down an objective into actionable steps and guide a team toward achieving that larger goal.""Platforms like Coursera and LinkedIn Learning offer courses and certifications in project management, but you can also showcase project management skills on your resume (or during an interview) by noting times where you led a project from start to finish, helped with budgeting or launched a new product or campaign, for example.  The ability to communicate clearly and effectively at work is a universal skill that's ""always in demand"" across ""all industries,"" Pollack notes, no matter what state the economy is in. ""Employers feel that they can never find people who can write and articulate their thoughts well."" Mastering the art of communication can help you stand out as a job candidate and find work in different industries. ""Even if you're sitting at your computer for work all day and reporting to one person, you need interpersonal skills to work on a team and convince an employer that your work adds value,"" Kantenga says. Examples of communication skills include presentations, emails, giving feedback and negotiating a business deal. While these three skills can help you weather the next recession, the most important skill of all, according to Pollak, is paying attention to the news and keeping track of which industries are making long-term investments in hiring. ""The costs and benefits of different jobs will change during a recession,"" she says.

On Friday, China reported GDP growth of just 0.4% in the second quarter from a year ago, missing expectations as the economy struggled to shake off the impact of Covid controls.The statistics bureau described the latest economic results as ""hard-earned achievements"" but warned about the ""lingering"" impact of Covid and ""shrinking demand"" at home.In the second quarter of 2022, China faced its worst Covid outbreak since the height of the pandemic in early 2020. While the central government has taken steps to cut the quarantine period and eased some Covid prevention measures in Beijing and Shanghai, the situation is still volatile and closely watched.Different parts of China have had to reinstate Covid restrictions due to a spike in new cases.President Xi Jinping pledged last month to use ""more forceful"" measures to achieve the country's economic targets for the year. But Beijing's strict Covid strategy has caused analysts to cut their forecasts for annual growth to levels far below the official goal of around 5.5%.In a recent report, financial services group Macquarie pointed out that China only grew 2.5% year-on-year in the first half of this year. That means GDP growth has to ""accelerate to over 7% in second half of 2022 to deliver an annual growth of 5% for the whole year this year,"" it said.""It is impossible without a significant escalation of policy stimulus from the current level,"" the company said.To mitigate the economic damage from the Covid lockdowns, China still needs more stimulus to see a meaningful recovery for this year, according to investment bank Morgan Stanley.The Wall Street bank expects GDP growth to pick up gradually to 2.7% year-on-year in the third quarter and 4.7% in the fourth quarter, on the back of additional support from infrastructure stimulus.It estimates the total fiscal and quasi-fiscal boost to infrastructure will reach 7 trillion Chinese yuan ($1.04 trillion) this year — about 3 times the value of 2.4 trillion Chinese yuan from last year. Still, Morgan Stanley doesn't expect the planned infrastructure spending to have a significant impact on China's growth.""It's not going to be enough. And that's why our narrative is that it's going to be a subpar recovery. To get that full-fledged recovery, we will have to see relaxation of Covid restrictions in a proper manner,"" Chetan Ahya, chief economist at the bank, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Monday.""We think that's going to happen later... probably towards the end of this year. But more meaningfully showing up in numbers only in early 2023,"" he added. As ADB pointed out in its report, China's property sector has been reeling from defaults and mortgage boycotts, which could also dampen growth.Real estate and related industries account for more than a quarter of China's economy, according to Moody's estimates.""The property sector is quite a big chunk of the economy and to that extent, we are not seeing policymakers getting in front of this problem — addressing this issue of financing for the property sector,"" said Ahya.""This is still going to be a drag in the second half,"" he added.— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report"

A further 24 hour walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union will take pace on July 27.On Tuesday, more than 115,000 Royal Mail workers, members of the Communication Workers Union, overwhelmingly voted to go on strike in a dispute over pay, with 97.6% of members from a 77% voter turnout backing industrial action.Royal Mail's U.K. business, the country's former state postal monopoly privatized in 2015 after nearly 500 years of government ownership, could be separated from the holding company after losing £92 million ($110 million) in the first quarter. Revenues fell 11.5% as inflation squeezed consumers into reducing online shopping, while parcel volumes were down 15%.CWU Deputy General Secretary Terry Pullinger told the BBC on Wednesday that the 97.6% vote in favor of industrial action was a ""measure of the anger"" felt by Royal Mail workers.""Royal Mail workers – key workers during the pandemic, key workers always – have had 2% (pay increase) imposed on them,"" he said.""When shareholders are being given millions of pounds off the back of what those workers have done over the past year or so, and also the leaders of the company and members of the board are giving themselves huge wages, they're giving themselves huge bonuses, but there's just 2% imposed on postal workers, and it's unacceptable."" The U.K. energy regulator Ofgem raised its price cap by 54% in April to accommodate surging wholesale prices, and analysts expect a further increase to the cap in October, which could drive inflation well above its current levels in the fall.Lauren Thomas, U.K. economist at Glassdoor, said the country's red-hot labor market and falling real wages mean the country is facing ""a tale of two economies.""""The number of payrolled employees and job vacancies continue to grow and remain historically high, particularly in face-to-face industries including healthcare and hospitality. However, overall vacancy growth has begun to slow,"" she said.""Economic inactivity rates fell as those who had left the job market re-entered, perhaps as a result of the cost of living crisis forcing people back to work. Even those working didn't see relief with both real regular pay and total pay down.""Ghosts of the 1970sThe prospect of widespread industrial action has drawn parallels to the U.K.'s ""winter of discontent"" in 1978-79, when almost 30 million working days were lost to strikes during a period of high inflation.The country's anti-strike legislation subsequently intensified and union membership dwindled in the decades since, with Conservative politicians trying to sway public opinion by characterizing union leaders as greedy.However, recent efforts from the major unions in light of an unprecedented squeeze on working households have begun to gather momentum, and have been met with greater public sympathy. Last week — faced with a deluge of strikes through the summer — outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government passed a law permitting companies to replace striking workers with agency staff in a bid to undermine unions.Speaking at his final Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Johnson accused Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, of having ""union barons pulling his strings from beneath him"" and vowed to ""outlaw wildcat strikes"" — a continuation of recent efforts to tie trade unionists to the government's political opposition."
2022-07-22,"The 50 basis point increase to the key rate was broadly well received by the markets and commentators.Inflation is running at a record high in the 19-member common currency bloc and the ECB was lagging behind its peers in kickstarting the process of monetary tightening.However, the announcement of a new anti-fragmentation tool has been met with skepticism by some economists.""There is a danger that the ECB is crossing the line into financing governments here, jeopardizing its independence and setting the wrong incentives for fiscal and economic policy,"" said Clemens Fuest, president of Germany's Ifo Insitute. The European Central Bank toughened its anti-inflationary stance with a 50 basis point hike to interest rates and announced a new anti-fragmentation tool, but analysts are unconvinced that these measures will tackle the euro zone's myriad of economic challenges.The 50 basis point increase to the key rate on Thursday was broadly well received by the market and commentators, with inflation running at a record high in the 19-member common currency bloc and the ECB lagging behind its peers in kickstarting the process of monetary tightening.However, the aggressive move comes against a backdrop of slowing growth and risks tipping the economy into recession, as the external pressures arising from the war in Ukraine and associated energy supply concerns show little sign of abating.An unexpected contraction of July's euro zone PMI (purchasing managers' index) readings on Friday will only serve to further these concerns. Capital Economics said the new data suggests ""the euro zone is teetering on the brink of recession due to slumping demand and rising costs.""The Frankfurt-based institution also launched the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), an anti-fragmentation tool aimed at supporting nations with large debt burdens and high borrowing costs, like Italy, and limiting discrepancies among euro zone member states. The TPI can be activated to counter ""unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area,"" the ECB said.Details released later on Thursday showed that the tool could be used when certain countries see surging borrowing costs due to factors beyond their control, providing those countries had stuck to ""sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies.""However, the hazy nature of the new tool's application, and its place in the contemporary function of monetary policy, have raised more questions than answers for many analysts.TPI – addressing the symptom rather than the causeClemens Fuest, president of Germany's Ifo Institute for economic research, said in a statement Friday that he welcomed the surprisingly large increase to the key interest rate, but criticized the effort to limit the gaps between the borrowing costs of different nations.""Interest rate differentials are part of a functioning capital market because they reflect different levels of risk, and private investors need to be convinced to take those risks,"" Fuest said.""There is a danger that the ECB is crossing the line into financing governments here, jeopardizing its independence and setting the wrong incentives for fiscal and economic policy.""He argued that if individual member states enter financial difficulties, it is not the ECB's job to intervene, but rather that of euro area governments and the ESM (European Stability Mechanism) bailout fund.The ESM has disbursed funds to support the likes of Spain, Greece, Portugal, Cyprus and Ireland in recalibrating their finances since its inception in 2012 through loans and other forms of financial assistance. ""The conditions defined by the ECB that a country must fulfill in order to receive financial support from the ECB are significantly weaker than those of the OMT bond-buying program introduced during the euro crisis, which requires at least an ESM program with far-reaching conditions,"" Fuest added.He suggested that in contrast to the OMT (Outright Monetary Transactions) program – in which under certain conditions, the ECB makes secondary purchases of sovereign bonds issued by euro zone member states – the ECB is not bound by any decision from other institutions in its TPI program, which leaves it vulnerable to political pressure to offer fiscal support to debt-laden member states.Fuest's skepticism was echoed by Shweta Singh, senior economist at Cardano, who said in a note Thursday that the TPI's deployment is subject to ""a whole lot of ECB-style constructive ambiguity.""""The eligibility, activation and termination criterions are all open to judgment and General Counsel discretion. The timing of the announcement of the TPI has coincided with the widening of BTP-Bunds spreads on the back of heightened political instability in Italy and raises a few interesting questions,"" Singh said. The spread between Italian and German bond yields is seen as a measure of stress in European markets – or a fear gauge – and has widened in recent months to its highest level since May 2020.Renewed political instability in Italy following the resignation of Prime Minister Mario Draghi, giving way to another national election on Sep. 25, has further damaged investor confidence.Singh said the key questions would be whether the ECB would act when spreads widen due to political concerns, as is the case now, and how the Governing Council would define an ""unwarranted"" widening of spreads.""In any case, we think the TPI is more likely to address the symptom (wider spreads, higher risk premia) rather than the cause (underlying differences in competitiveness, growth potential, debt levels, fiscal governance) and may have a muted impact on keeping spreads lower for longer,"" she said.""In the absence of concrete details, we think markets will test the ECB and while the approval of the TPI was unanimous, the implementation will be rife with concerns about monetary financing."" Despite the haziness surrounding the TPI's application, however, several analysts deemed it ""credible"" for the time being.BNP Paribas Senior European Economist Spyros Andreopoulos said in a note Thursday that the TPI ""looks credible to us in the medium term, based on the combination of ECB discretion and no ex-ante limit.""""However, the threshold for activation is likely high, suggesting the markets could still test the ECB in the short term,"" he added.UBS Chief Eurozone Economist Dean Turner and Head of Credit Thomas Wacker also acknowledged the lack of detail, but said the ""broad outline of the TPI seems to have bought the ECB enough credibility in the eyes of investors.""""The true test will come when conditions deteriorate to the point that the ECB has to use the TPI, something they hope that its very existence will prevent,"" UBS said."
2022-07-25,"The dollar was lower against a basket of major currencies on Monday, as investors weighed the implications of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve in an economy that may be on the verge of a recession.The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday. A hike of that magnitude would effectively close out pandemic-era support for the economy.Expectations for a hike of 75 basis points from the Fed stand at about 75%, according to CME's Fedwatch Tool, with a 25% chance of a 100 basis point hike.Recent data has shown signs of an economic slowdown while inflation remains stubbornly high, with claims for jobless benefits rising to its highest in eight months last week and regional manufacturing gauges slumping.Later in the week, investors will also eye the advance reading for second-quarter gross domestic product, which could show negative growth and meet a traditional definition of recession. On Friday, personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, will be released.""Everybody is expecting a 75 percent increase, a recession essentially the day after with a negative GDP so I don't think you are going to get anything changing right now,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com.""But right now, equities are going nowhere, the dollar has remained strong but has given back, the traders who went long the dollar took some profits which is perfectly normal.""The dollar index fell 0.27% at 106.44, with the euro up 0.14% to $1.0224.Last week, the greenback saw its biggest weekly percentage decline in two months, as a rally in equities helped dent the appeal of the safe-haven dollar and a 50 basis point rate hike by the European Central Bank helped buoy the euro to a two-week high.On Monday, Latvian central bank Governor Martins Kazaks said in an interview with Bloomberg News that the ECB may not be done with big rate hikes.U.S. equities gave up early gains with a slew of corporate earnings on deck for the week, including those from mega-cap names such as Apple, Microsoft MSFT.O> and Amazon AMZN.O>. Investors are eyeing the earnings season for signs of a slowdown in the economy as well as the impact of a strong dollar on profits.Of the 107 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Monday morning, 74.8% have topped analyst expectations, below the 81% beat rate over the past four quarters, but above the 66% rate since 1994, per Refinitiv data. Earnings growth is currently estimated to be 6.1%, up from 5.6% at the start of July.The Ifo business sentiment survey showed on Monday that business morale in Germany fell more than expected in July to its lowest in more than two years.The Japanese yen weakened 0.44% versus the greenback at 136.65 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2047, up 0.37% on the day.British industrial output grew at the slowest pace in over a year in the three months to July, but there are tentative signs that some challenges around inflation and investment are easing, a Confederation of British Industry survey showed on Monday.In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin last fell 4.05% to $21,687.61."
2022-07-25,"With second-quarter GDP data due out Thursday, the question of whether the economy is in recession will be on everyone's mind.The economy stands at least a fair a chance of hitting the rule-of-thumb recession definition of two consecutive quarters with negative GDP readings.Should inflation stay at high levels, that then will trigger the biggest recession catalyst of all, namely Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said ""we just don't have"" conditions consistent with a recession. The White House is sure the economy is not in a recession nor headed for one. Wall Street is pretty sure there is no recession now, but isn't as positive about what's ahead.Looking at the data, the picture is indeed nuanced. Nothing right now is screaming recession, though there is plenty of chatter. The jobs market is still pretty good, manufacturing is weakening but still expanding, and consumers still seem fairly flush with cash, if somewhat less willing to part with it these days.So with second-quarter GDP data due out Thursday, the question of whether the economy is merely in a natural slowdown after a robust year in 2021 or in a steeper downturn that could have extended repercussions, will be on everyone's mind.""This is not an economy that's in recession, but we're in a period of transition in which growth is slowing,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""A recession is a broad-based contraction that affects many sectors of the economy. We just don't have that."" On Monday, Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council during the Trump administration, pushed back on that view, and said the White House was making a mistake by not owning up to the realities of the moment.""We're ... kind of in recession, right? So it's a difficult time,"" Hassett, who is now a distinguished senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin during a live ""Squawk Box"" interview.""In this case, if I were in the White House I would not be out there sort of denying it's a recession,"" he added. If nothing else, the economy stands at least a fair a chance of hitting the rule-of-thumb recession definition of two consecutive quarters with negative GDP readings. The first quarter saw a gross domestic product decline of 1.6% and an Atlanta Federal Reserve gauge is indicating the second quarter is on pace to hit the same number.Wall Street, though, is seeing things a little differently. Though multiple economists, including those at Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Nomura, see a recession in the future, the consensus GDP forecast for the second quarter is a gain of 0.3%, according to Dow Jones.Whether the U.S. skirts recession will mostly rest in the hands of consumers, who accounted for 68% of all economic activity in the first quarter.Recent indications, however, are that spending retreated in the April-to-June period. Real (after-inflation) personal consumption expenditures declined 0.1% in May after increasing just 0.2% in the first quarter. In fact, real spending fell in three of the first five months this year, a product of inflation running at its hottest pace in more than 40 years.  It's that consumer inflation factor that is the U.S. economy's biggest risk now.While President Joe Biden's administration has been touting the recent retreat of fuel prices, there are indications that inflation is broadening beyond gasoline and groceries.In fact, the Atlanta Fed's ""sticky"" consumer price index, which measures goods whose prices don't fluctuate much, has been rising at a steady and even somewhat alarming pace.The one-month annualized Sticky CPI — think personal care products, alcoholic beverages and auto maintenance — ran at an 8.1% annualized pace in June, or a 5.6% 12-month rate. The central bank's flexible CPI, which includes things such as vehicle prices, gasoline and jewelry, rose at a stunning 41.5% annualized pace and an 18.7% year-over-year rate. One argument from those hoping that inflation will recede once the economy shifts back to higher demand for services over goods, easing pressure on overtaxed supply chains, also appears to have some holes. In fact, services spending accounted for 65% of all consumer outlays in the first quarter, compared to 69% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, according to Fed data. So the shift hasn't been that remarkable.Should inflation persist at high levels, that then will trigger the biggest recession catalyst of all, namely Federal Reserve interest rate hikes that already have totaled 1.5 percentage points in 2022 and could double before year-end. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected to approve another 0.75 percentage point increase.Fed monetary tightening is causing jitters both on Wall Street, where stocks have been in sell-off mode for much the year, as well as Main Street, with skyrocketing prices. Corporate executives are warning that higher prices could cause cutbacks, including to an employment picture that has been the main bulwark for those who think a recession isn't coming.Traders expect the Fed to keep hiking its benchmark rate, taking the fed funds level to a range of about 3.25%-3.5% by the end of the year. Futures pricing indicates the central bank then will begin cutting by the summer of 2023 — a phenomenon that wouldn't be uncommon as history shows policymakers usually start reversing course less than a year after their last move.Markets have taken notice of the tighter policy for 2022 and have started pricing in a higher risk of recession.""The more the Fed is set to deliver on further significant hikes and slow the economy sharply, the more likely it is that the price of inflation control is recession,"" Goldman Sachs economists said in a client note. ""The persistence of CPI inflation surprises clearly increases those risks, because it worsens the trade-off between growth and inflation, so it makes sense that the market has worried more about a Fed-induced recession on the back of higher core inflation prints.""On the bright side, the Goldman team said there's a reasonable chance the market may have overpriced the inflation risks, though it will need convincing that prices have peaked.Financial markets, particularly in fixed income, are still pointing to recession.The 2-year Treasury yield rose above the 10-year note in early July and has stayed there since. The move, called an inverted yield curve, has been a reliable recession indicator for decades.The Fed, though, looks more closely at the relationship between the 10-year and 3-month yields. That curve has not inverted yet, but at 0.28 percentage point as of Friday's close, the curve is flatter than it's been since the early days of the Covid pandemic in March 2020.  If the Fed keeps tightening, that should raise the 3-month rate until it eventually surpasses the 10-year as growth expectations dwindle.""Given the lags between policy tightening and inflation relief, that too increases the risk that policy tightens too far, just as it contributed to the risks that policy was too slow to tighten as inflation rose in 2021,"" the Goldman team said.That main bulwark against recession, the jobs market, also is wobbling.Weekly jobless claims recently topped 250,000 for the first time since November 2021, a potential sign that layoffs are increasing. July's numbers are traditionally noisy because of auto plant layoffs and the Independence Day holiday, but there are other indicators, such as multiple manufacturing surveys, that show hiring is on the wane.The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index, which incorporates a host of numbers, was negative in July for the second straight month. The Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing index posted a -12.3 reading, representing the percentage difference between companies reporting expansion vs. contraction, which was the lowest number since May 2020.If the jobs picture doesn't hold up, and as investment slows and consumer spending cools some more, there will be little to stand in the way of a full-scale recession.One old adage on Wall Street is that the jobs market is usually the last to know it's a recession, and Bank of America is forecasting the unemployment rate will hit 4.6% over the next year.""On the labor market, we're basically in a normal recession,"" said Hassett, the former Trump administration economist. ""The idea that the labor market is tight and the rest of the economy is strong, it's not really an argument. It's just an argument that disregards history."""

2022-07-26,"The IMF now expects the world economy to grow 3.2% in 2022 before slowing to a 2.9% GDP rate in 2023 — marking a downgrade of 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively, from April.The Washington-based institute said the revised outlook indicated that the downside risks outlined in its earlier report were now materializing. Those include soaring global inflation, China's slowdown and the war in Ukraine. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global growth projections for 2022 and 2023, dubbing the world's economic outlook ""gloomy and more uncertain.""The IMF now expects the world economy to grow 3.2% this year, before slowing further to a 2.9% GDP rate in 2023.

A ""plausible"" but less likely alternative scenario could see global growth fall to around 2.6% in 2022 and 2.0% in 2023, the IMF said, putting global growth in the bottom 10% of outcomes since 1970.The World Bank last month slashed its 2022 global growth outlook to 2.9% from an earlier estimate of 4.1%, citing similar macroeconomic pressures. Worsening growth prospects in the U.S., China and India drove the IMF's downward revisions.The U.S.'s GDP outlook was lowered 1.4 percentage points to 2.3%, driven be weaker-than-expected growth in the first half of 2022, reduced household purchasing power and tightening monetary policy.China's economy was seen growing 1.1 percentage points short of previous estimates, following extended Covid lockdowns and a deepening real estate crisis. The world's second-largest economy is now expected to grow 3.3% in 2022 — its lowest clip in four decades, barring the initial fallout from the Covid-19 crisis in 2020. India's forecast was cut 0.8 percentage points to 7.4%, largely due to less favorable external conditions and more rapid policy tightening.Meanwhile, the euro zone's outlook was lowered 0.2 percentage points to 2.6%, though the IMF said greater fallout from the war in Ukraine was likely to hit further in 2023, particularly in the major economies of Germany, France and Spain.Russia's economy contracted less than expected in the second quarter despite wide-reaching economic sanctions over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the IMF said. Its 2022 projection was revised up 2.5 percentage points, though its estimated growth rate remains negative at -6.0%. It comes as inflation continues to track higher through 2022, led by rising food and energy prices.Global inflation is now forecast to hit 6.6% in advanced economies and 9.5% in emerging market and developing economies this year — an upward revision of 0.9 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively.""It will take longer for inflation to go away and the overall magnitude of inflation is expected to come later this year,"" Tobias Adrian, financial counsellor and director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the International Monetary Fund, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche Tuesday afternoon.""We would expect a recession that is fairly shallow. A recession with growth rates around zero for the next year. That's in the adverse scenario, it's not a very sharp recession,"" like the one we saw the wake of Covid-19 and 2008 global recession, he added.With rising prices fueling a global cost-of-living crisis, the IMF said taming inflation should be policymakers' number one priority.""Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delay will only exacerbate them,"" the report said. It added that policies to address higher energy and fuel prices should focus on the most vulnerable groups without distorting overall prices.For months now, central banks have been progressively embracing tighter monetary policy. The European Central Bank last week joined the likes of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in raising interest rates — its first such move in 11 years.Yet still, inflation has remained persistent, hitting 40-year highs in the U.S. and the U.K. last month."

Ustenko said Zelenskyy believes these banks should be held accountable for prolonging the conflict and the war on Ukraine.His comments came in response to a FT report last week, which said that Ukraine's government wrote to the chiefs of U.S. and European banks — such as Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan and Noel Quinn from HSBC — urging them to cut ties with the groups that are trading Russian oil. In letters seen by the FT,  Ustenko wrote to the bankers asking them to cut off financing for businesses that trade Russian oil and sell shares to Gazprom and Rosneft, two of Russia's state-backed oil and gas companies.According to the FT, the letters accused Citigroup and Credit Agricole of ""prolonging"" the war by providing finances to companies that ship Russian oil. The letters also reportedly warned the banks will not be allowed to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine when the war is over.CNBC did not immediately hear back from Credit Agricole when asked about those allegations. Ukraine's government is gathering all the evidence to send it to the International Criminal Court, Ustenko told CNBC.""We are collecting all these information"" in terms of companies that are financing Russia, he said. ""Our Ministry of Justice and our security service of Ukraine are collecting. And then later, this is going to be passed to the ICC,"" he added.This isn't the first time that Ukraine has gone after Western companies for having business dealings with Russia.In March, the government was highly critical of big oil companies for still doing business with Russia, and warned that some of those firms could find themselves on the wrong side of history.

Marcos, outlining on Monday his economic agenda that will focus on fiscal management, infrastructure upgrades and agricultural productivity, vowed to ensure affordable prices and adequate domestic supply of key agricultural products, including rice, amid a looming global food crisis.

""They're recognizing there are two sides of this – there's a growth tradeoff to fight inflation. The recognition is something we heard today that we didn't hear before.""Powell said that the Fed could slow rate hikes in the months ahead and said that there could be some more financial tightening ""in the pipeline"" from the hikes that have already been made but maybe haven't taken full effect yet throughout the economy.Chaudhuri said the market was reacting to several things, including the fact the Fed stuck to a 75 basis point hike and did not go more aggressively. She said it was a positive the statement reflected that the economy was slowing, and the fact that it will be data dependent going forward.""They knew this was something the market would pay attention to, and they want to take sure we notice they acknowledge the slowing down of the economy"" as a result of their policy, she said.— Patti Domm, Jesse Pound  Wed, Jul 27 20223:25 PM EDT Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in his press conference today that ""it doesn't make sense that the economy would be in recession,"" given monthly payroll growth has recently been averaging 450,000 jobs, and that employers added 2.7 million jobs in the first half. ""I do not think that the U.S. is currently in a recession,"" he said, ""and the reason is there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well."" To be sure, ""growth is slowing for reasons that we understand. Growth was exceptionally high last year, 5.5%. We would have expected growth to slow. There's also more slowing going on now,"" Powell added.Read more here.-Scott Schnipper, Carmen Reinicke  Wed, Jul 27 20223:17 PM EDT For investors chomping at the bit and ready to buy risky assets, Oanda's senior market analyst Ed Moya said the time might not be right just yet.""A clear greenlight to buy up risky assets won't happen until we see evidence inflation is coming down,"" he said.""Inflation risks will remain elevated as energy shortages are likely, supply chain issues won't ease given a weakening global outlook, and as pandemic-related issues remain troubling,"" Moya added. — Pippa Stevens  Wed, Jul 27 20223:32 PM EDT -Brian Clark  Wed, Jul 27 20223:10 PM EDT Preliminary gross domestic product numbers should generally be taken with a ""grain of salt,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said.""It's very hard to cumulate U.S. GDP, it's a large economy and a lot of work and judgment goes into that,"" Powell said.

Wed, Jul 27 20222:55 PM EDT -Brian Clark  Wed, Jul 27 20222:44 PM EDT The Federal Reserve is on the hunt for signs that inflation is easing, according to Fed Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.""Over coming months we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2%,"" Powell said.He added that the Fed expects likely increases to the target range for the fed funds rate going forward, however, that pace is dependent on future data and the economy.— Samantha Subin  Wed, Jul 27 20222:37 PM EDT Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in his opening remarks that the state of the economy has not changed too much over the past month.""From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to support maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high,"" Powell said.—Jesse Pound  Wed, Jul 27 20222:35 PM EDT The current interest rate hiking cycle is swiftly proving to be one of the Fed's most aggressive in recent decades, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors said. They'll need to continue to tamp down inflation, she said. ""Combatting four-decade high inflation will take a sustained show of strength from the Fed, rendering a soft landing an almost impossible pipe dream,"" said Shah.Still, the central bank's next move may not be as large as the hike Wednesday.""From here, it is possible that the Fed slows its tightening pace, reassured by the likely peaking of inflation and pullback in inflation expectations as oil prices have fallen,"" Shah said. ""However, with the labor market still a picture of strength, wage growth still uncomfortably high and core inflation set to decline at a glacially slow pace, the Fed certainly cannot stop tightening, nor can it downshift gears too much.""She expects that rates will rise above 4% next year before a recession hits, potentially opening the door for rate cuts in late 2023.— Carmen Reinicke  Wed, Jul 27 20222:27 PM EDT Bleakley Advisory Group's Peter Boockvar called the latest statement from the Federal Open Market Committee a ""big yawner"" given the minimal changes from the June meeting.""The FOMC statement was a big yawner with only modest changes to it relative to the June meeting,"" he wrote. ""After saying in June that ""overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter,"" they certainly backtracked on that as they should have.""According to Boockvar, that puts added pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference later this afternoon, which should steer expectations going forward.""While he has no reason yet to commit to anything, I'm sure that Powell will let us know that he remains vigilant in his battle with inflation at the same time 'hoping' that it won't involve a recession, even though it's basically too late for that,"" he said.— Samantha Subin  Wed, Jul 27 20222:16 PM EDT The most notable change in this meeting's Fed policy statement came right at the top.""Recent indicators of spending and production have softened,"" the statement began.

However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell took an aggressive stance against inflation at the last meeting, and he could do so again on Wednesday.""I think the Fed will be more hawkish than dovish. I think that people in the market are looking for them to pull back and slow down the hawkish nature of their general commentary, and I think this meeting they're going to be disappointed,"" said Eric Merlis, managing director, global markets at Citizens Financial.In fact, some traders have started to price in rate cuts next year, anticipating a pivot from the Fed.

""I've got to watch more what they say than what they do. Meaning, I don't think the 75 or the statement are going to be that interesting.

Indeed, pending home sales slid 20% in June on a year-over-year basis, according to the latest data from the National Association of Realtors. Meanwhile, new orders for manufactured durable goods in June rose by 1.9% to $272.6 billion, the Census Bureau found.Second-quarter GDP data is due on Thursday. Since the first quarter saw GDP decline by 1.6%, economists and investors are wondering whether this next release will reflect two consecutive quarters of negative GDP readings.Two back-to-back negative GDP quarters don't constitute a recession, however. The National Bureau of Economic Research makes that determination and uses multiple factors to do so.-Darla Mercado  Wed, Jul 27 20221:37 PM EDT The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point – its second hike of that magnitude since June and a first in the ""modern era"" of Fed policy.The anticipated rate hike comes at a pivotal time as policymakers attempt to slow inflation and provide the economy with a soft landing. The consumer price index for June leapt 9.1% from a year ago, and consumer spending on a dollar level has been solid. Meanwhile, jobless claims have ticked higher, which suggests the labor market is starting to cool.Investors are paying especially close attention to the Fed's decision Wednesday because second-quarter gross domestic product numbers are out on Thursday. GDP declined by 1.6% during the first quarter. Two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth could make the Fed's path on rate hikes even more precarious.-Darla Mercado, Jeff Cox "

The global space economy grew last year at the fastest annual rate since 2014, hitting a record of $469 billion, according to a report by the Space Foundation released Wednesday.Total output by the world's governments and corporations in the realm of rockets, satellites and more expanded by 9% year-over-year, the report says.While 2022 has seen a slowdown in U.S. markets and the economy, Space Foundation CEO Tom Zelibor told CNBC that the space economy is expected to weather the storm and continue growing this year.""Maybe it won't be this record-breaking number,"" Zelibor said, ""but the space industry has really shown itself to be pretty resilient."" He noted the industry's growth during the height of the Covid pandemic.""I really don't see a change,"" he said.The Space Foundation is a U.S. nonprofit founded in 1983, focused on education and advocacy regarding the industry.Financial activity in the space economy, such as M&A and private investment, has seen a slowdown in 2022, Zelibor acknowledged, but he emphasized that government and commercial spending remain strong. For example, the report highlighted commercial space's growth to $362 billion last year – with space-based products and services such as broadband and GPS generating continued revenue as staples of the modern global economy.Government spending continues to grow, and Zelibor highlighted that there are ""over 90 countries operating in space now.""The United States remains the biggest spender, with its $60 billion total space budget nearly quadruple of the next largest, China. Additionally, India and multiple European countries each increased space spending by 30% or more in 2021, although those countries' budgets remain under $2 billion a year.Zelibor also emphasized that the first six months of 2022 has seen 75 rocket launches worldwide, matching the record pace set in 1967 by the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the race to the moon. ""It's phenomenal,"" he said.The report noted that about 90% of the more than 1,000 spacecraft launched this year have been backed by commercial firms — most notably the hundreds of Starlink internet satellites launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX."
2022-07-27,"Prices for goods in the U.S. are expected to continue rising through 2023.The Federal Reserve waited too long to respond to early signals of inflation, according to independent economists and outside policymakers.The central bank is correcting the course by raising its interest rate targets at the fastest pace in more than two decades. Top officials at the Federal Reserve were seeing inflation data come in very hot for months before policymakers moved to wind down monetary policies that were stimulating the economy.A chorus of analysts, economists and former policymakers have chimed in, saying that was a mistake.""The forward guidance, overall, slowed the response to the Fed to the inflation problem"" former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke told CNBC.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also acknowledged the misdiagnosis coming from her own department, and that of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.""Both of us could have probably used a better word than 'transitory,'"" she told senators in June when asked about their remarks about inflation last year and their slow response to price pressures.It's the Fed's task to tame inflation that is running at a pace not seen in four decades. To do so, it has been hiking interest rates at a fast pace.Reining in inflation may take more aggressive monetary policy moves than the central bank has embraced in recent years, according to economists like Judd Cramer. His research indicates that the Fed may need to hike rates to levels not seen in decades to force rising prices into retreat.""If inflation is going to be high and remain higher, that means that the neutral rate in the economy is also going to be higher because the price of goods are going up,"" he said to CNBC.A June survey of inflation expectations from the New York Federal Reserve suggests the price hikes aren't over yet. The group predicts that by June 2023, prices will have risen approximately 6.8% from their current levels. Maintaining stable prices and maximizing employment are the Fed's top responsibilities. Jobs appear plentiful in the U.S., which may give the central bank cover to raise interest rates at an aggressive pace through 2023.The Federal Reserve was contacted for comment but is in a media blackout before the expected rate announcement later today.Watch the video above to learn more about the Fed's missteps on inflation, along with its plan to get the economy back on track."
2022-07-28,"(Biden is scheduled to begin speaking at 2:15 p.m. ET. Please refresh the page if the video above doesn't play at that time.)President Joe Biden will deliver remarks on the U.S. economy Thursday and meet with a small group of CEOs to ""receive an update on economic conditions across key sectors and industries,"" according to the White House.Two chief executives are scheduled to attend in person: Corning CEO Wendell Weeks and Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano.Three other corporate leaders will join the meeting by video call: Bank of American CEO Brian Moynihan, Thasunda Brown Duckett, who leads the retirement fund giant TIAA, and Punit Renjen, the chief executive of Deloitte.Several administration officials will also be at the event: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Cecelia Rouse, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.The meeting comes as the Biden White House is trying very hard to convince Americans that the U.S. economy is not sliding into a recession.As more and more economic data emerges that points to a slowdown, Biden is going on the offensive to argue that the U.S. economy is healthy.Earlier in the day Thursday, Biden addressed the question of a recession by pointing to the low unemployment rate and the strong growth of manufacturing jobs over the past few years.""That doesn't sound like a recession to me,"" he said in a brief speech at the White House."
2022-07-28,"U.S. government debt prices rose on Thursday after the preliminary GDP reading for the second quarter showed an economic contraction.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped by about 6 basis points to 2.669%. The 2-year yield fell 10 basis points to 2.868%. Yields move inversely to prices and one basis point is equal to 0.01%. Second-quarter GDP slipped 0.9%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday. This marked the second-straight negative quarter for GDP, a metric which has historically often coincided with economic downturns.Though some on Wall Street use two-straight negative quarters of GDP as a shorthand definition for recession, U.S. recessions are officially designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which uses a more nuanced definition. Solid job growth during the first half of the year, and impact of high imports on GDP, have led some to speculate that the NBER will not declare a recession during the first two quarters of 2022.Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to 3.023%, though it has eased from where it traded before the release of GDP data.Thursday's market moves came after the Fed decided to raise interest rates by 75 basis points for a second month in a row to combat high inflation. Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will be making rate hike decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis.In addition, the Fed also said the U.S. economy is not in recession as ""there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well."" The comments pushed U.S. stocks higher during Wednesday's session."
2022-07-28,"""It is not entirely clear whether a recession has begun,"" said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst.Here's a look at what consumers are in for in the months ahead, and what they can do about it now. Americans want to know: Is this a recession or not?Officially, the National Bureau of Economic Research defines recession as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.""In fact, the latest quarterly gross domestic product report, which tracks the overall health of the economy, showed a second consecutive contraction this year.More from Personal Finance:What the Fed's 75-basis point rate hike means for youWhat the latest interest rate hike means for your savingsNearly half of all Americans are falling deeper in debtHowever, both President Joe Biden and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said we're not in a recession just yet, pointing to the strong labor market and rising wages.""One question is answered, but a larger one is not,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. ""We now know that the economy has contracted for two consecutive quarters.""It is not entirely clear whether a recession has begun given the continued strength of the job market,"" he said. Even if the NBER doesn't declare a recession, the economy is far from out of the woods.Higher interest rates and unrelenting inflation pose major dangers ahead.And regardless of the country's economic standing, consumers are struggling in the face of sky-high prices, and nearly half of Americans say they are falling deeper in debt.While this may look different from previous downturns, there are certain things that rarely change. 1. It could get harder to find a job: Recent signs show the labor market, which was on fire in 2021, may be beginning to cool.Hiring has slowed somewhat already, while uncertainty is running high about where the economy is headed.Although the unemployment rate has remained just above the prepandemic low, ""Powell seems to be warning us that the job market will likely weaken in this higher interest rate environment amid the fight against historically high inflation,"" Hamrick said.The Fed on Wednesday announced another major rate hike of 0.75 percentage points to cool things down — particularly inflation, which remains at a 40-year high. 2. Your investments may falter: Meanwhile, fears that the Fed's aggressive moves could tip the economy into a recession have caused markets to slide for weeks in a row.""You've had all asset classes enjoy that last shot of liquidity over the last couple of years,"" said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. Now, ""there are more headwinds that the markets face than tailwinds.""In times of turmoil, some advisors recommend a shift to stocks paying a high dividend while sticking with short- to immediate-term fixed-income assets.However, Boneparth also advises clients to look for opportunities.""Good investors need to be proficient at not just buying on the way up but buying on the way down,"" he said.During the last recession, ""anyone with hindsight would have enjoyed some of the steepest discounts in the capital markets,"" he said. 3. Home price inflation will fall: House prices haven't exactly fallen, but they aren't rising as fast as they once were and a recession would very likely cause the housing market, as a whole, to slow down, according to Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree.Lending standards could also tighten, which means that many would-be homebuyers could find that getting a loan is difficult, or they'll have to pay a higher interest rate to close the deal. ""All in all, this means that a recession would make it harder for people to get mortgages and to buy homes,"" Channel said.However, this won't be a ""2007-2008-style crash,"" he added.The housing market is in a much better place than it was in the early 2000s, Channel said. And, even if prices fluctuate, ""as long as you stay the course and keep making your payments, you'll probably end up being OK."" While the impact of a recession would be felt broadly, every household would experience a pullback to a different degree, depending on income, savings and financial standing.  Still, there are a few ways to prepare that are universal, according to Larry Harris, the Fred V. Keenan Chair in Finance at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business and former chief economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Here's his advice for consumers:Streamline your spending. ""If they expect they will be forced to cut back, the sooner they do it, the better off they'll be,"" Harris said. That may mean cutting a few expenses now that you just want and really don't need, such as the subscription services that you signed up for during the pandemic. If you don't use it, lose it.Avoid variable rates. Most credit cards have a variable annual percentage rate, which means there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark, so anyone who carries a balance will see their interest charges jump with each move by the Fed. Homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages or home equity lines of credit, which are pegged to the prime rate, will also be affected.That makes this a particularly good time to identify the loans you have outstanding and see if refinancing makes sense. ""If there's an opportunity to refinance into a fixed rate, do it now before rates rise further,"" Harris said.Stash extra cash in Series I bonds. These inflation-protected assets, backed by the federal government, are nearly risk-free and pay a 9.62% annual rate through October, the highest yield on record.Although there are purchase limits and you can't tap the money for at least one year, you'll score a much better return than a savings account or a one-year certificate of deposit, which pays less than 1.5%.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."
2022-07-29,"U.S. government debt prices fell Friday as traders continued to weigh the prospects of a U.S. recession following a a second consecutive quarter of economic contraction.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note traded 2 basis points lower at 2.658%, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2 basis points to 3.017%. Yields move inversely to prices. On Thursday the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the personal consumption expenditures price index, an inflation indicator closely watched by the Fed, rose 6.8% from a year ago in June, hitting its highest level since January 1982.The final reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index came in at 51.5 for July, a slight improvement over the preliminary reading. In June the index fell to an all-time low 50.The latest U.S. growth reading showed the economy contracted by 0.9%, in what is seen as recession sign.""The Q2 GDP contraction is fueling fears that the US economy is in recession,"" wrote strategists at BCA Research. ""Regardless of whether this is indeed the case ... there are two key questions that are more relevant for investors. ""First, what are the implications for Fed policy? And second, what are the implications for financial markets?""""On the first point, one clear difference this time around versus previous downturns is the robustness of the labor market,"" they added. ""In terms of implications for financial markets, the fact that US stocks rallied on Thursday following the disappointing GDP print suggests that equity markets have already discounted the risk of recession."""
2022-07-29,"The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 6.8% in June, the biggest 12-month move since the 6.9% increase in January 1982.Excluding food and energy, so-called core PCE increased 4.8% from a year ago, up one-tenth of a percentage point from May.The employment cost index, another figure Fed policymakers follow closely, rose 1.3% in the second quarter. The index climbed 5.1% on a 12-month basis, a record for data series that goes back to 2002. An inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve uses as its primary barometer jumped to its highest 12-month gain in more than 40 years in June, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Friday.The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 6.8%, the biggest 12-month move since the 6.9% increase in January 1982. The index rose 1% from May, tying its biggest monthly gain since February 1981.Excluding food and energy, so-called core PCE increased 4.8% from a year ago, up one-tenth of a percentage point from May but off the recent high of 5.3% hit in February. On a monthly basis, core was up 0.6%, its biggest monthly gain since April 2021.Both core readings were 0.1 percentage point above the Dow Jones estimates.Fed officials generally focus on core inflation, but have turned their attention recently to the headline numbers as well, as food and fuel prices have soared in 2022.The BEA release also showed that personal consumption expenditures, a gauge of consumer spending, increased 1.1% for the month, above the 0.9% estimate and owing largely to the surge in prices. Real spending adjusted for inflation increased just 0.1% as consumers barely kept up with inflation. Personal income rose 0.6%, topping the 0.5% estimate, but disposable income adjusted for inflation fell 0.3%.Earlier this month, data showed the consumer price index rose 9.1% from a year ago, the biggest gain since November 1981. The Fed prefers PCE over CPI as a broader measure of inflation pressures. CPI indicates the change in the out-of-pocket expenditures of urban households, while the PCE index measures the price change in goods and services consumed by all households, as well as nonprofit institutions serving households.There was other bad inflation news Thursday.The employment cost index, another figure Fed policymakers follow closely, rose 1.3% in the second quarter. That represented a slight decline from the 1.4% gain in the previous quarter, but was ahead of the 1.1% estimate. Further, the 5.1% increase on a 12-month basis marked a record for a data series that goes back to the first quarter of 2002.""The rest of the economy might be slowing down, but wages are speeding up,"" said Nick Bunker, economic research director at job placement site Indeed. ""Competition for workers remains fierce as employers have to keep bidding up wages for new hires. These red-hot wage growth statistics may fade in the near term, but there's a long way for them to drop.""The Fed has been using a recipe of rate increases and a reduction in asset holdings to bring down prices that have soared to their highest levels since the Reagan administration and have helped cool consumer spending.Private sector wage gains of 1.6% for the quarter are ""seriously disappointing"" for the Fed, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.The Fed follows the ECI figures because they adjust for compositional effects, or imbalances between gains from higher- and lower-wage workers, as well as other factors.""Wage gains at this pace are far too high for the Fed, because they would require implausible rapid productivity growth in order to be consistent with the inflation target in the medium-term,"" Shepherdson wrote.Fed officials earlier this week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase in the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Inflation by any measure has been running well above the Fed's 2% longer-run target, and Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is ""strongly committed"" to bringing inflation down.In normal times, the Fed focuses on inflation excluding food and energy costs because they are so volatile and don't always reflect longer-run trends. But Powell acknowledged Wednesday that policymakers need to be attentive to both types of inflation in the current environment.""Core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward, headline inflation tends to be volatile. So, in ordinary times, you look through volatile moves in commodities,"" he said. ""The problem with the current situation is that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations. The public doesn't distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking.""Markets expect the Fed to raise rates by another half percentage point in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tracker. However, the probability for a bigger three-quarter-point hike rose Friday morning to 38%."
2022-07-29,"Officials in Europe have become increasingly concerned about the possibility of a shutdown of gas supplies.Gazprom, Russia's majority state-owned energy giant, reduced gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 20% of full capacity this week.A growing number of economists are expecting the euro zone to slide into a recession next year. Growth in the euro zone economy accelerated in the second quarter of the year, but the region's prospects get hit as Russia continues to reduce gas supplies.The 19-member bloc registered a gross domestic product rate of 0.7% in the second quarter, according to Eurostat, Europe's statistics office, beating expectations of 0.2% growth. It comes after a GDP rate of 0.5% in the first quarter.The numbers contrast sharply with the negative annualized readings out of the United States for both the first and second quarter, as the euro zone continues to benefit from the reopening of its economy after the pandemic.However, a growing number of economists are expecting the euro zone to slide into a recession next year, with Nomura, for example, forecasting an annual contraction of 1.2% and Berenberg pointing to a 1% slowdown.Even the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has admitted that a recession could be on the cards — and as early as this year if Russia completely cuts off the region's gas supplies.Officials in Europe have become increasingly concerned about the possibility of a shutdown of gas supplies, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying Russia is ""blackmailing"" the region. Russia has repeatedly denied it's weaponizing its fossil fuel supplies.However, Gazprom, Russia's majority state-owned energy giant, reduced gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 20% of full capacity this week. Overall, 12 EU countries are already suffering from partial disruptions in gas supplies from Russia, and a handful of others have been completely shut off. European Economics Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said the latest growth figures were ""good news.""""Uncertainty remains high for the coming quarters: [we] need to maintain unity and be ready to respond to an evolving situation as necessary,"" he said.The GDP readings come at a time of record inflation in the euro zone. The European Central Bank hiked interest rates for the first time in 11 years earlier this month — and more aggressively than expected — in an effort to bring down consumer prices.However, the region's soaring inflation is being driven by the energy crisis, meaning further cuts of Russian gas supplies could push up prices even more.""Given the challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic factors that have been at play over the past few months, it's positive to see the eurozone experience growth, and at a higher rate than last quarter,"" Rachel Barton, Europe strategy lead for Accenture, said in an email.""However, it's clear that persistent supply chain disruption, rising energy prices and record-breaking levels of inflation will have a longer-term impact.""Meanwhile, Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said Friday's GDP figure would mark ""by far the best quarterly growth rate for a while.""""Indeed, news that inflation was once again even higher than anticipated only underlines that the economy is heading for a very difficult period. We expect a recession to begin later this year,"" he added.Eurostat also published revised inflation figures Friday, putting annual inflation at 8.9% in July, up from 8.6% in June."
2022-08-01,"As experts debate whether or not the U.S. is already in a recession, many Americans are already bracing themselves for a downturn.Consumer spending may have a big impact on the U.S. economy in the months to come, according to UBS, which projects 40% odds of a recession in the next 12 months.One survey finds the biggest fears about a downturn vary by generation. Yet to address each of them, coming up with a financial plan may be the best solution, one expert says. As experts debate whether the U.S. is on the brink of an economic downturn, many Americans are already bracing themselves for a recession.To that point, 66% of Americans worry that a major recession is right around the corner, up from 48% who said the same a year ago, according to a survey by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America.One big reason is that people fear high inflation, which has pushed prices higher for goods and services.The survey found 82% worry inflation will have a negative impact on their purchasing power in the next six months. Moreover, the same share of respondents said they expect inflation to get worse over the next 12 months.More from Personal Finance:What a recession could mean for youBest money moves after the Fed's interest rate hikesNearly half of all Americans are falling deeper in debtMeanwhile, 71% said their wages are not keeping pace with rising expenses.(Allianz Life conducted the online survey in June and polled just over 1000 individuals.)Data released last week by the U.S. Department of Commerce only further stoked fears of a downturn, with gross domestic product declining for a second straight quarter, a traditional signal of a recession.However, the White House was quick to reject speculation that a recession is already here, with President Joe Biden citing record low unemployment, among other factors. Consumer spending increased 1.1% in June due to rising inflation, according to government data released last week.Yet as recession fears rise, that may already be prompting Americans to change the way they handle their money. Even with the latest data, consumer spending has been pretty flat for the past seven months, according to Jonathan Pingle, chief U.S. economist at UBS.At the start of the year, households were in good shape with excess savings and solid labor market gains. But then high gas prices and rising interest rates were piled on.""Altogether, it's just proven to be a much weaker trajectory for consumer spending than I think most people expected,"" Pingle said. ""Where we sit now is kind of in a tenuous spot for the economy."" The big question experts are debating now is whether or not the country is already in a recession.UBS' probability model currently has a 40% odds of a recession in the next 12 months. The first quarter slowdown in GDP had some ""really noisy"" components, which were payback from a strong fourth quarter in 2021, said Pingle, making the reason for quarter-to-quarter declines still inconclusive.A consumer-led recession is one way in which a U.S. downturn could play out, according to a recent UBS research report. Another scenario may be caused by the Federal Reserve overtightening.If consumer spending pulls back, that could be a confidence shock, Pingle said. That could be prompted by households increasing precautionary savings as they worry about the future and postpone purchases.To be sure, ramping up savings and paring down spending are the tips generally given to individuals who want to limit the impact of an economic downturn on their finances. ""Pay down your debt, boost your savings and keep making those retirement savings contributions throughout the ups and downs,"" said Greg McBride, senior vice president and chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.""Long-term, when you look back you'll be really glad you invested in 2022,"" he said. Yet Allianz Life's recent survey found 65% of investors say they are keeping more money than they should out of the market now due to fears of losses.For baby boomers, the No. 1 concern, cited by 73%, is that they will not be able to afford the lifestyle they want in retirement due to rising costs. That was up from 66% who cited that worry in the first quarter.""Having this kind of a downturn coupled with this type of inflation for somebody who is newly retired can really drain your assets significantly faster than you had ever expected,"" said Kelly LaVigne, vice president of consumer insights at Allianz Life.For Gen X, the biggest worry is that their income is not keeping pace with rising costs, cited by 75% of respondents, up from 68% in the first quarter. Meanwhile, fewer millennials have a financial plan in place to handle rising inflation. The survey found 56% currently have such a plan, down from 61% in the first quarter.For all individuals, coming up with a financial plan can help limit the effect of economic uncertainties, LaVigne said.""Regardless of whether you think you have enough money or not, there's a right financial advisor out there for you,"" LaVigne said. ""And it's never too early and it's certainly never too late.""Not having a plan is the worst thing you can do,"" he added."
2022-08-01,"The two pledges would take income tax from 20p to 16p. Sunak said the plan would mark the biggest income tax cut since the time of Margaret Thatcher.Sunak told BBC Radio on Monday he would fund the tax cut by growing the economy and being disciplined with public spending. Rishi Sunak, trailing in the race to become Britain's next prime minister, has vowed to slash the basic rate of income tax by 20% by 2029 in a potentially make-or-break throw of the dice by the former finance minister.   Sunak, once seen as the favorite to replace Boris Johnson when he helped to steer the economy through the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic, has struggled against his rival, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who has pledged immediate tax cuts.Sunak said he remained focused on tackling inflation but once that was achieved he would follow through on an already-announced plan to take 1 pence ($0.012) off income tax in 2024, and then take a further 3 pence off by the end of the next parliament, likely around 2029.The two pledges would take income tax from 20p to 16p. Sunak said the plan would mark the biggest income tax cut since the time of Margaret Thatcher.""It is a radical vision but it is also a realistic one,"" he said in a statement late on Sunday, a day before Conservative Party members are due to start receiving their ballot papers to vote for the party's new leader.Sunak told BBC Radio on Monday he would fund the tax cut by growing the economy and being disciplined with public spending.Britain's hunt for a new prime minister was triggered on July 7 when Johnson was forced to announce his resignation following months of scandal. Conservative lawmakers have whittled a field of candidates down to Truss and Sunak, with an announcement of the decision by party members due on Sept. 5.With inflation surging to a 40-year high of 9.4% and growth stalling, the economy dominated early stages of the contest, with Sunak arguing that Truss's plan to reverse a rise in social security contributions and cancel a planned rise in corporation tax would stoke inflation further.""I don't think embarking on a spree of excessive borrowing at a time when inflation and interest rates are already on the rise would be wise,"" Sunak said.    Sunak said each penny cut from the rate of income tax would cost around 6 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) a year, a figure that he said would still allow Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio to fall, if the economy grows in line with official forecasts.Truss has argued that tax cuts are needed now to give the economy a shot in the arm. A recent poll by YouGov showed Truss held a 24-point lead over Sunak among Conservative Party members."

2022-08-02,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan's capital of Taipei on Tuesday night for a controversial visit that has infuriated Beijing and strained the already tense U.S.-China relationship.After warning Pelosi for weeks not to come to the disputed territory China responded Tuesday by announcing new import bans on certain Taiwanese goods.The Chinese military has also flexed its muscle with recent live-fire exercises just 80 miles from Taiwan, and the deployment Tuesday of fighter jet to the Taiwan Strait WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan's capital of Taipei on Tuesday night, kicking off a controversial visit that had already strained the testy relationship between Beijing and Washington before it even began.China has spent weeks warning Pelosi not to come to the disputed territory, which Beijing considers a province of China, but which considers itself an independent nation.These warnings escalated into actions during the hours ahead of Pelosi's arrival, which marked the first time in 25 years that an American House speaker has visited Taiwan. The visit will reportedly last almost 24 hours.Hua Chunying, China's assistant minister of foreign affairs, said in a string of tweets Tuesday that Pelosi's visit to Taiwan was a ""major political provocation.""On Tuesday, China reportedly levied new import bans on more than 100 Taiwanese products, an apparent effort to impose a quick economic cost on Taipei for its role in Pelosi's high-profile visit.The Chinese military also flexed its muscle by holding live-fire exercises all day Saturday, just 80 miles from Taiwan.On Tuesday, as Pelosi's visit drew near, the People's Liberation Army deployed fighter jets to the Taiwan Strait that flew very close to the center line of the strait, which is rarely crossed.As Pelosi landed Tuesday night, Chinese state-affiliated media announced that more live-fire exercises would be conducted over the coming weekend -- notably, after Pelosi has left the area.For China experts, these military drills and bellicose public statements come as little surprise.

I mean, it's not out of the question, but I would really be surprised,"" he said in an interview with CNBC.""What is likely to happen is some sort of subsequent actions to demonstrate that China can do something if it wants to,"" said Mertha. ""And that will be something as much for the domestic audience within China as for the international one.""Later this year, Chinese leader Xi Jinping is expected to begin an unprecedented third term as leader of the Chinese Communist Party.Xi's need to consolidate public support and power within his party are the lens through which we should be looking at China's geopolitical actions, diplomats and experts say.And this is exactly what makes Pelosi's visit so provocative.After weeks of Pelosi refusing to confirm or deny or discuss the Taiwan visit, The Washington Post published a scathing op-ed by Pelosi just as she landed Tuesday.Taiwan, she wrote, ""is under threat"" from Beijing, which she painted as an existential danger to free people everywhere.""We take this trip at a time when the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy,"" she said. ""We cannot stand by as the CCP proceeds to threaten Taiwan — and democracy itself.""""Our congressional delegation's visit should be seen as an unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan, our democratic partner, as it defends itself and its freedom.""But while Pelosi's op-ed was aimed squarely at Xi, this is not the same strategy that President Joe Biden, her fellow Democrat, has chosen to pursue.Biden's approach to China is one that seeks to maintain a stable, predictable relationship with America's biggest trading partner, while also acknowledging that Washington and Beijing are strategic adversaries.Officially, the Biden administration was careful in recent weeks to avoid directly saying whether the president agreed with Pelosi's decision to visit Taiwan. But unofficially, the White House and the Pentagon made little secret of their opposition to it.

2022-08-03,"  The CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Confidence Index hit an all-time low in the third quarter 2022, with President Biden's approval hitting an all-time low as well.More than three-quarters (77%) of small business owners expect inflation to continue to rise and only about one-quarter (26%) have faith in Federal Reserve policy.As the Fed hikes interest rates to cool demand in the economy, more than half of small business owners say the recession has already begun, and Main Street's sales outlook took a big hit, the biggest contributor to the new all-time low in confidence. Small business confidence has hit an all-time low as the majority of Main Street expects runaway inflation and a Federal Reserve that is incapable of engineering a soft landing for the economy, leading to revenue declines and staffing cuts across sectors.The majority of small business owners (57%) taking part in the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q3 2022 think the recession has already begun, while another 14% predict recession before the end of the year.The CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted July 25-31, 2022 among a national sample of 2,557 self-identified small business owners.The pessimism on Main Street is more widespread than in the general population, according to the survey, which included a companion poll of nearly 12,000 non-business owners. Among this group, 45% believe the U.S. economy has entered a recession.The CNBC|SurveyMonkey data is in line with other polling of the small business community.""Outlook for business conditions in our monthly survey has deteriorated quite a bit from the beginning of the year,"" said Holly Wade, executive director of research at the National Federation of Independent Business, speaking at CNBC's Small Business Playbook virtual summit on Wednesday. While inflation in input costs, energy prices and labor have been a top concern for small business owners throughout the year, its dominance in the minds of entrepreneurs continues to climb. According to the Q3 survey, 43% of small business owners say inflation is the biggest risk to their business right now, up again from last quarter, when it was 38%, and the highest this reading has reached in the past four quarters of surveys.""It certainly ramped up since the beginning of the year, and most don't see much end in sight or easing of this problem,"" Wade said.More than three-quarters (77%) of small business owners polled expect prices to continue going up. And while many large corporations continue to pass along price increases to customers and report healthy profits, only 13% of small businesses said now is a good time to raise prices.""Their No. 1 tool in dealing with inflation, those higher input costs, is passing along those costs to the customer. Unfortunately, a lot of times, they're not able to do that immediately. So it's really hurting cash flow and making managing cash flow really difficult and impacting earnings,"" Wade said.Only a minority of small business owners (26%) have confidence in the Federal Reserve to successfully battle inflation — a finding that is consistent with the Q2 survey results.The Fed has continued to message inflation as its top priority and that interest rates will continue to increase until it has prices under control, but Fed senior leadership including Chair Jerome Powell have said they do not believe the economy is in a recession.""We're not in a recession right now. ... To some extent, a recession is in the eyes of the beholder,"" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC on Wednesday.GDP has been negative for two consecutive quarters, a recession indicator based on history, but by some measures, the U.S. economy is proving resilient. While big box stores have been hit hard by shifting consumer behavior, overall consumer spending levels are still high. The labor market is strong, unemployment is low, and the latest macroeconomic data has given more support to the belief that recession may be avoided. The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index, released Wednesday, showed a surprise rebound. The stock market, meanwhile, just turned in its best month since 2020. Economists say that small business sentiment, similar to consumer sentiment, tends to be reactive rather than based on longer-term forecasting, and that can result in sharper, shorter-term shifts in sentiment. The current recession view on Main Street, as captured by the Small Business Survey, differs significantly from the Fed view. But in the details that make up the core confidence index, there is more general reflection of the economic slowdown that the Fed is attempting to engineer and that more optimistic economists call a soft landing.According to SurveyMonkey, which conducts the poll for CNBC, nearly every index component worsened quarter-over-quarter, but the confidence indicator that looms largest this quarter is a weaker sales outlook on Main Street. As the Fed attempts to cool demand throughout the economy with higher interest rates, over one-quarter (28%) of small business owners expect their revenue to decrease over the next 12 months, up from 21% last quarter. This was the biggest swing factor in the overall confidence index hitting an all-time low in Q3.More small businesses also anticipate cutting staff over the next year, up from 14% to 18% quarter over quarter.The percentage of small business owners who describe business conditions as good (33%), went down again, from 36% in Q2 2022. Just over half (51%) of small business owners say the economy is ""poor,"" up from 44% last quarter.Almost three-quarters (74%) expect higher interest rates to be a negative for their business.The confidence index score was 42 out of 100, down from 46 in the second quarter. The previous low was a score of 43 during the first quarter of the Biden Administration. Wade said that even as many small business owners in the NFIB survey don't think the recession has begun, they are anticipating economic headwinds. ""We've seen a falling off of those expecting higher sales in the next quarter,"" she said.But currently, she said employment and sales in the small business sector are ""holding up."" The small business demographic skews conservative and the confidence index reflects some partisan sentiment and persistent gaps in survey answers based on politics. For example, 69% of Republican small business owners believe the economy is in a recession, compared to 34% of Democrats polled. This gap is even wider in how small business owners describe the economy, with 68% of Republicans using the word ""poor,"" compared with 19% of Democrats.More troubling for President Joe Biden, though, is the significant percentage of small business owners who identify as Democrats and think inflation will continue to rise. While that figure is 89% among Republicans, and the partisan gap is wide, more than half of Democrats (51%) agree.President Biden's approval rating on Main Street hit the lowest level of his administration, with 31% of small business owners approving of how he has handled the job of president. While 81% of small business owners who are Democrats approve of Biden, pollsters have noted during this period of high inflation that presidents expect the vast majority of their party to offer support, often north of 90%. And as the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey has shown this year, Biden's approval rating will not improve unless inflation goes down. Biden's approval among important swing voters who identify as independents is at 29%.Only 9% of Republicans approve of Biden's handling of the presidency."
2022-08-03,"The employment picture over the past six months is behaving nothing like an economy in a downturn.Even with the other evidence suggesting otherwise, many commentators have focused on the traditional definition of recession as being two straight quarters of negative GDP growth. If the U.S. economy is in recession, someone forgot to tell the jobs market.The employment picture over the past six months is behaving nothing like an economy in a downturn, instead creating jobs at a rapid pace of nearly 460,000 a month.Research from CNBC's Steve Liesman indicates that during a typical downturn, the employment picture would be far gloomier, losing ground instead of gaining. Several charts presented during Wednesday's ""Squawk Box"" help paint the picture.The CNBC team looked at economic data going back to 1947. It indicated that when gross domestic product has been negative for six months, as is the case for 2022, payrolls fall by an average of 0.5 percentage point. But this year, the job count actually has increased by 1%. Data from human relations software company UKG backs up that notion, with internal data that shows jobs have been created about in line with the Bureau of Labor Statistics' count. Finally, the Dallas Federal Reserve, in research posted Tuesday, said its analysis of multiple data points found ""that most indicators — particularly those measuring labor markets — provide strong evidence that the U.S. economy did not fall into a recession in the first quarter"" of the year.One data point the central bank's researchers looked at was real personal consumption expenditures. They found that consumption generally declined during recessions. By contrast, the measure increased during the first half of 2022. Even with the other evidence suggesting otherwise, many commentators have focused on the traditional definition of recession as being two straight quarters of negative GDP growth. The first quarter declined 1.6%, and the second quarter fell 0.9%, meeting that standard.Another anomalous factor about the current state is that even though GDP fell in real inflation-adjusted terms, the economy on a nominal basis grew strongly during the second quarter. Nominal GDP rose 7.8% during the period but was outweighed by an 8.6% quarterly inflation rate.By contrast, during the last recession, in 2020, nominal GDP contracted 3.9% in the first quarter and 32.4% in the second quarter, while real GDP fell 5.1% and 31.2%, respectively.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC, also during ""Squawk Box,"" that he doesn't think the economy is in a recession, though he was more dismayed by the second-quarter decline.""The first-quarter slowdown, I think, ... was probably a fluke, but the second quarter was more concerning,"" he said. Even if some rate-sensitive pockets of the economy slow, ""that doesn't by itself mean you're in recession just because you see some negative signs in some parts of the economy.""The latest data on the jobs picture comes out Friday, when the BLS is expected to report a payrolls gain of about 258,000 for July, according to Dow Jones estimates. BLS data earlier this week showed that the gap between job openings and available workers is still vast but edging lower."
2022-08-03,"The pandemic-era work-from-home trend has allowed employers to pay less than they otherwise might, reducing fear of a ""wage-price"" inflationary spiral, according to a recent economic paper. That dynamic helps the Federal Reserve, which is raising interest rates to cool the economy and tame stubbornly high inflation. While the Federal Reserve raises borrowing costs aggressively to tame stubbornly high inflation, remote work may be serving as an unlikely ally to the U.S. central bank.The Fed increased its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage point last week, after having raised it by a similar amount at its policy meeting in June. By doing so, officials are trying to cool the economy and rein in rapidly rising consumer prices.Meanwhile, the Covid pandemic-era work-from-home trend may be helping to cap inflation, according to a recent working paper co-authored by a group of five economists and published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.More from Personal Finance:Anxiety about recession as inflation cuts spending powerCredit card balances jump as inflation outpaces wage growthWhat a recession could mean for youAs many employees have enjoyed commute-free workdays, less stress and better work-life balance, their employers have also benefited from remote work by paying lower wages than they otherwise might — preventing higher wages from feeding into a so-called wage-price inflationary spiral, the researchers said.Specifically, researchers found that 38% of employers had expanded opportunities to work from home or another remote location in the 12 months through May in order to reduce what they termed ""wage-growth pressures""; 41% expect to do so in the next year.  In practice, that reduction can occur in a few ways: Employees may accept a smaller raise from their current employer as a tradeoff for working from home a few days a week, or take a new job at lower pay but with a greater opportunity to work remotely, according to Steven J. Davis, an economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a co-author of the study.The other co-authors of the recent academic paper include Jose Maria Barrero of the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University, and Brent H. Meyer and Emil Mihaylov of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The researchers found that employers' expansion of remote work opportunities results in a cumulative decline of 2 percentage points in wage growth over that two-year period — ""a nontrivial amount,"" according to Davis.It's the equivalent, for example, of getting a 5% raise instead of a 7% raise, he said. But it's not necessarily lost value for employees; they can think of remote work as a form of nonfinancial compensation, Davis added.""The opportunity to work from home adds to the amenity value of a job,"" he recently told CNBC. ""Just like working in a nicer office would make a job more desirable."" That amenity value can come via being able to do a load of laundry or bake something in the oven during the workday — essentially, being productive in other parts of an employee's life in addition to work, according to Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. Workers also save time commuting to the office, and that time savings has an associated value, she added.""That quality-of-life improvement also means they needed to be compensated less,"" Pollak has told CNBC.In addition, there may also be cost savings derived from remote work. Employees who drive can reduce their expenditures on gasoline, for example. And workers who can relocate to a less-costly geographic area or closer to family members to help save on child-care costs, for example, may feel less financial pressure to ask for a raise, Pollak added. ""Workers seem to know what they want,"" Pollak said. ""They are extremely, extremely bullish on remote work.""About 63% of job seekers say they'd prefer remote work — a number that has stayed remarkably stable throughout 2022, said Pollak, who cited monthly ZipRecruiter survey data. This wage-capping dynamic is important relative to one aspect of inflation: the fear of a so-called wage-price spiral.This economic theory suggest workers, faced with rapidly rising household prices, will ask their bosses for an income boost to defray the financial pain — which they have the bargaining power to do in the current red-hot job market. Businesses then raise the prices for their goods and services to offset higher labor costs, which in turn leads to more inflation, and more raises, and so on. Of course, factors other than historically large pay bumps are feeding into inflation, which is currently at its highest since November 1981. The war in Ukraine has caused prices for commodities such as oil to spike, and supply chains haven't fully recovered from pandemic-related issues, for example.But the rise of remote work, which has ""materially"" reduced wage growth pressures, also serves to alleviate some inflationary pressures, according to the paper. In fact, the dynamic shrinks the impact of the so-called wage catch-up effect on inflation by 54%, researchers estimate. (The wage catch-up effect is essentially the dynamic of workers asking for a raise to keep up with inflation.)This modestly eases the task of taming inflation without triggering a recession, according to researchers — an undertaking the Federal Reserve has begun in recent months. The central bank is raising interest rates, and therefore borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, in a bid to slow the economy and rein in prices. Employers may be leveraging remote work to cap wage growth not just with existing employees, but also while recruiting, Davis said. A company based in San Francisco might try hiring a full-time remote worker in Boise, Idaho, for example, so it can pay a lower salary based on geography, Davis said.Of course, not everyone is able to work from home part or full time. While 65% of those with a bachelor's degree can telework, that's true for just 53% of those with some college education or less, according to the Pew Research Center. There's also an income divide, Pew found — 67% of upper-income employees can telework versus 53% of low-income workers."

LONDON — The Bank of England on Thursday defended its decision to hike interest rates at the fastest clip in 27 years, saying the U.K. faces a ""very big"" shock to inflation.BOE Governor Andrew Bailey said that the risks of high inflation becoming persistent had risen since the Bank's previous meeting in June, prompting it to take ""stronger action.""""We're facing a very big shock to inflation,"" Bailey told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. ""Our action today was very, very clearly [that] we feel we've got to take stronger action.""The BOE on Thursday raised interest rates by 50 basis points, taking borrowing costs to 1.75% in an ongoing bid to curb soaring inflation.It also issued a dire outlook for U.K. economic growth, predicting that the country will enter recession from the fourth quarter of 2022, with the downturn expected to last for five quarters. The central bank has faced criticism for not acting sooner and more aggressively to tackle runaway inflation. But Bailey insisted Thursday that many of the inflationary shocks facing the U.K. economy were external and unexpected — most notably Russia's war in Ukraine and its detrimental impact on energy prices.""We don't make policy with hindsight,"" Bailey said. The war in Ukraine ""is not something that was foreseen or frankly could be foreseen."" The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee approved the sixth consecutive rate hike by a majority of 8-1 in favor of the historic half-point hike.The rate increase marks the central bank's biggest single increase since 1995 as it attempts to shift inflation back toward its 2% target.U.K. inflation hit a new 40-year high of 9.4% in June as food and energy prices continued to surge, deepening the country's historic cost-of-living crisis. The BOE said it now sees U.K. inflation peaking at 13.3% in October, well above the 11% previously predicted, and driven particularly by soaring energy prices. It added that it expects inflation to remain at elevated levels through much of 2023, before falling toward its target in 2025.""This rise in energy prices has exacerbated the fall in real incomes and so led to another significant deterioration in the outlook for activity in the U.K., and in the rest of Europe. GDP growth in the U.K. has slowed and the economy is now forecast to enter recession later this year,"" Bailey said during a press conference earlier on Thursday.The Bank's shift toward a more aggressive tightening stance puts it closer in line with other Western monetary policymakers. Last month, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank hiked rates by 75 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively.Market analysts said that the BOE's determination to ""forcefully"" counter inflation suggests that it could implement a further 50 basis point hike at next month's meeting.""The priority for now clearly remains focused on controlling inflation at the expense of growth,"" said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury.""This indicates that another 50 basis point rate hike is possible at the next MPC meeting in September, depending on economic data in the interim.""— CNBC's Elliot Smith contributed to this report."
2022-08-04,"Yum Brands CEO David Gibbs recently crystallized the confusion a lot of people are feeling right now as they try to figure out what's going on with the U.S. economy.A shrinking economy typically doesn't come with high inflation and a red-hot labor market.Perhaps the economy is so bizarre because consumers are no longer acting rationally. In an earnings call this week, Yum Brands CEO David Gibbs expressed the confusion many people are feeling as they try to figure out what's going on with the U.S. economy right now:""This is truly one of the most complex environments we've ever seen in our industry to operate in. Because we're not just dealing with economic issues like inflation and lapping stimulus and things like that. But also the social issues of people returning to mobility after lockdown, working from home and just the change in consumer patterns.""Three months earlier, during the company's prior call with analysts, Gibbs said economists who call this a ""K-shaped recovery,"" where high-income consumers are doing fine while lower-income householders struggle, are oversimplifying the situation.""I don't know in my career we've seen a more complex environment to analyze consumer behavior than what we're dealing with right now,"" he said in May, citing inflation, rising wages and federal stimulus spending that's still stoking the economy.At the same time, societal issues like the post-Covid reopening and Russia's war in Ukraine are weighing on consumer sentiment, which all ""makes for a pretty complex environment to figure out how to analyze it and market to consumers,"" Gibbs said.Gibbs is right. Things are very strange. Is a recession coming or not?There is ample evidence for the ""yes"" camp.Tech and finance are bracing for a downturn with hiring slowdowns and job cuts and pleas for more efficiency from workers. The stock market has been on a nine-month slump with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off more than 20% from its November peak and many high-flying tech stocks down 60% or more.Inflation is causing consumers to spend less on nonessential purchases like clothing so they can afford gas and food. The U.S. economy has contracted for two straight quarters. Downtown San Francisco doesn't quite have the ghost town feel it did in February, but still has vast stretches of empty storefronts, few commuters and record-high commercial real estate vacancies, which is also the case in New York (although Manhattan feels a lot more like it's back to its pre-pandemic hustle).Then again:The travel and hospitality industries can't find enough workers. Travel is back to nearly 2019 levels, although it seems to be cooling as the summer wanes. Delays are common as airlines can't find enough pilots and there aren't enough rental cars to satisfy demand.Restaurants are facing a dire worker shortage. The labor movement is having its biggest year in decades as retail workers at Starbucks and warehouse laborers at Amazon try to use their leverage to extract concessions from their employers. Reddit is filled with threads about people quitting low-paying jobs and abusive employers to ... do something else, although it's not always exactly clear what.A shrinking economy typically doesn't come with high inflation and a red-hot labor market.Here's my theory as to what's going on.The pandemic shock turned 2020 into an epoch-changing year. And much like the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the full economic and societal effects won't be understood for years.Americans experienced the deaths of family members and friends, long-term isolation, job changes and losses, lingering illness, urban crime and property destruction, natural disasters, a presidential election that much of the losing party refuses to accept, and an invasion of Congress by an angry mob, all in under a year.A lot of people are dealing with that trauma — and the growing suspicion that the future holds more bad news — by ignoring propriety, ignoring societal expectations and even ignoring the harsh realities of their own financial situations. They're instead seizing the moment and following their whims.Consumers aren't acting rationally, and economists can't make sense of their behavior. It's not surprising that the CEO of Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, can't either.Call it the great unrest.How might that manifest itself? In a decade, how will we look back at the 2020s?Perhaps:Older workers will continue to leave the workforce as soon as they can afford it, spending less over the long term to maintain their independence, and stitching together freelance or part-time work as needed. The labor market will remain tilted toward workers.Workers in lower-paying jobs will demand more dignity and higher wages from their employers, and be more willing to switch jobs or quit cold if they don't get them.People will move more for lifestyle and personal reasons rather than to chase jobs. Overstressed workers will continue to flee urban environments for the suburbs and countryside, and exurbs one-to-three hours' drive from major cities will see an upswing in property values and an influx of residents. Dedicated urban dwellers will find reasons to switch cities, creating more churn and reducing community bonds.The last vestiges of employee loyalty will disappear as more people seek fulfillment ahead of pay. As one tech worker who quit her job at Expedia to work for solar tech company Sunrun recently put it, ""You just realize there's a little bit more to life than maxing out your comp package.""Employees who proved they could do their jobs remotely will resist coming back to the office, forcing employers to make hybrid workplaces the norm. Spending patterns will change permanently, with businesses catering to commuters and urban workers continuing to struggle.Those with disposable income will vigorously spend it on experiences — travel, restaurants, bars, hotels, live music, outdoor living, extreme sports — while curbing the purchase of high-end material goods and in-home entertainment, including broadband internet access and streaming media services. The pandemic was a time to hunker down and upgrade the nest. Now that we've got all the furniture and Pelotons we need, it's time to go out and have fun.It's possible that this summer will be the capstone to this period of uncertainty and consumers will suddenly stop spending this fall, sending the U.S. into a recession. Further ""black swan"" events like wars, natural disasters, a worsening or new pandemic, or more widespread political unrest could similarly squash any signs of life in the economy.Even so, some of the behavioral and societal shifts that happened during the pandemic will turn out to be permanent.These signals should become clearer in earnings reports as we move further from the year-ago comparisons with the pandemic-lockdown era, and as interest rates stabilize. Then, we'll find out which businesses and economic sectors are truly resilient as we enter this new era.WATCH: Jim Cramer explains why he believes inflation is coming down"
2022-08-05,"U.S. job growth blew past expectations in July, adding 528,000 jobs and officially reaching the point where we've recovered the 22 million jobs lost during the pandemic, according to the Labor Department.The volume of job gains, the largest in six months, surprised many economists given recent interest rate hikes, high inflation and a volatile stock market. New jobs in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, and health care led the gains.""Amid stiff headwinds and rising uncertainty, strong consumer spending continued to drive robust demand for labor and buoy the labor market,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, in a statement.""The outlook from the jobs report today is that the economy continues to go gangbusters,"" said Christopher Kayes, management professor at the George Washington University School of Business, in a statement. ""This is a blowout jobs report with almost twice as many jobs created than people had predicted.""""I think this is really going to make people continue to question whether the economy is going to be tanking,"" he added.In another positive sign, the average unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%, and people who experienced job loss were unemployed for a median of 8.5 weeks. Pollak says this suggests the labor market is tight enough that people being laid off are getting hired into new jobs quickly. Despite overall job growth, Pollak said two other measures signal conflicting stability in the job market. First, the number of people working part-time for economic reasons rose, signaling that people are having trouble finding full-time work. However, temp jobs, often staffed through agencies, also increased, which is a good sign that these workers, who tend to be the first let go during budget cuts, are still in demand.Average hourly earnings are up 0.5% for the month and 5.2% from the same time a year ago, though wage growth appears to be slowing, Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, wrote on Twitter.Decelerating wage growth could mean ""the Fed doesn't need more interest rate increases to contain inflation,"" she said. ""Though today's release underscores we're almost surely not in a recession now, the Fed may have already overshot and secured a recession in coming months."" While the labor market has recovered all private-sector jobs lost during the pandemic, government jobs remain down by nearly 600,000 — ""a troubling phenomenon for public sector workers and the vital services they provide,"" wrote Elise Gould, senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute, on Twitter.Women gained 327,000, or about 62%, of new jobs in July, marking 19 consecutive months of job growth, according to the National Women's Law Center. But despite recent momentum, women are still down 100,000 net jobs since pre-pandemic.Men have recovered all their net job losses and now hold 132,000 more jobs today than in February 2020.And while the overall unemployment decreased to 3.5%, near record lows, it increased for Black workers up to 6% in July. Despite gloomy recession forecasts as of late, workers seem to be confident in their ability to find a new job if they want one or are forced to look for new work.A majority, 70%, of workers have an optimistic outlook on the labor market, according to a June survey of more than 1,500 people from Greenhouse, the recruitment software company. The same share, 70%, believe the U.S. will enter a recession in the next six months. And though many anticipate their wages would fall during an economic downturn, 66% of people said they would actively look for a new job if their current employer cut their pay.Indeed, Kayes said the latest job numbers indicate the Great Resignation is still going strong isn't likely to end soon.""I think a lot of it is going to be shocking to those managers, those CEOs, those leaders who think that a recession will be something that allows them to hire more people, that it's going to change the job market,"" Kayes said. ""There will still be more positions than there are people to fill them, and organizations that don't change the way they do business are going to continue to fall short in hiring.""Recent headlines of high-profile layoffs, especially at tech companies, don't seem to be an indicator of broad layoffs ahead. Layoffs made up 1% of the workforce in June, near record lows, according to the Labor Department.""We are not seeing, for the most part, increases in layoffs at all,"" said Rucha Vankudre, senior economist at Lightcast, during a briefing Friday. ""There's a few companies that really built up their labor force because they had the money. And so now maybe they're cutting back to the regular levels, but that doesn't necessarily signal anything for the labor force as a whole.""One certainty: Today's job market, contrasted with other economic indicators like falling gross domestic product, is making it really unclear about how workers will fare in the coming months.The picture today is ""so incredibly different from anything we've ever experienced,"" said Ron Hetrick, senior economist at Lightcast.""Employers are still starving to get employees,"" he says. ""They were never able to hire them when they had so much demand. So I think everybody needs to keep an open mind because things could look very, very different this time around. And I absolutely believe this is not going to be the kind of pain that we usually associate with a recession, historically speaking.""Check out:4.2 million people quit in June despite recession worries: 'A paradox in our economy'What's a good salary or raise to ask for right now?

2022-08-05,"There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July.But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the biggest danger.The Federal Reserve's rate tightening to address inflation poses a recession threat into 2023. You'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story.There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction.But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years. ""The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. ""It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.""Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data.So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July.That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is ""how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.""""Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,"" Rieder said in a client note. ""The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?"" Financial markets were betting against the Fed in other ways.The 2-year Treasury note yield exceeded that of the 10-year note by the highest margin in about 22 years Friday afternoon. That phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale recession sign particularly when it goes on for an extended period of time. In the present case, the inversion has been in place since early July.But that doesn't mean a recession is imminent, only that one is likely over the next year or two. While that means the central bank has some time on its side, it also could mean it won't have the luxury of slow hikes but rather will have to continue to move quickly — a situation that policymakers had hoped to avoid.""This is certainly not my base case, but I think that we may start to hear some chatter of an inter-meeting hike, but only if the next batch of inflation reports is hot,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Sonders called the current situation ""a unique cycle"" in which demand is shifting back to services from goods and posing multiple challenges to the economy, making the debate over whether the U.S. is in a recession less important than what is ahead.That's a widely shared view from economists, who fear the toughest part of the journey is still to come.""While economic output contracted for two consecutive quarters in the first half of 2022, a strong labor market means that currently we are likely not in recession,"" said Frank Steemers, senior economist at The Conference Board. ""However, economic activity is expected to further cool towards the end of the year and it is increasingly likely that the U.S. economy will fall into recession before year end or in early 2023."""
2022-08-05,"Mainland China and Hong Kong accounted for 42% of Taiwan's exports last year, while the U.S. had a 15% share, according to official Taiwan data accessed through Wind Information.About 22% of Taiwan's imports last year came from mainland China and Hong Kong, versus 10% from the U.S., official data showed.Many Taiwan-based companies operate factories in mainland China. In 2021, Taiwan businesses received $200.1 billion in U.S. export orders, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service. BEIJING — Data show that Taiwan depends more on China for trade than it does on the U.S., even if U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi threw her weight behind Taiwan this week in a high-profile visit.Taiwan came under military and economic pressure from Beijing this week, after the democratically self-ruled island allowed the visit of Pelosi — the highest-ranking U.S. official to set foot on Taiwan in 25 years.The visit came despite warnings from China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory and maintains the island should have no right to conduct foreign relations. The U.S. recognizes Beijing as the sole legal government of China, while maintaining unofficial relations with Taiwan.Still, Taiwan's business and economic ties with mainland China and Hong Kong have grown so large that the region is by far the island's largest trading partner.Many large Taiwanese companies in high-tech industries such the world's biggest chipmaker — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC. — operate factories in mainland China.Last year, mainland China and Hong Kong accounted for 42% of Taiwan's exports, while the U.S. had a 15% share, according to official Taiwan data accessed through Wind Information. In all, Taiwan exported $188.91 billion in goods to mainland China and Hong Kong in 2021. More than half were electronic parts, followed by optical equipment, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Finance.Taiwan's exports to Southeast Asia were even greater than those to the U.S. — at $70.25 billion to the region, versus $65.7 billion to the U.S., the data showed.As a source of Taiwan's imports, mainland China and Hong Kong again ranked first with a 22% share. The U.S. only had a 10% share, ranking behind Japan, Europe and Southeast Asia. In recent years, Taiwan has bought an increasing amount of products from mainland China, and vice versa.Over the last five years, Taiwan's imports from mainland China have surged by about 87% versus 44% growth in imports from the U.S.Taiwan's exports to mainland China grew by 71% between 2016 and 2021. But exports to the U.S. nearly doubled, growing by 97%. Read more about China from CNBC ProThis Chinese social media platform is a buy that can surge 60%, UBS saysMissed the A.I. rally?

According to a 2020 census, about 157,900 people from Taiwan resided in mainland China, a roughly 7% decrease over the preceding decade.The entire island of Taiwan was home to about 23.6 million people in 2020, slightly less than Shanghai's population of roughly 25 million people at the time.However, Taiwan's economy is larger than Shanghai's, at about $781.58 billion versus $680.31 billion last year, according to official figures.In 2021, Shanghai's share of mainland China's GDP was 3.8%."
2022-08-08,"Oil prices rose 1.5% on Monday, hovering near their lowest levels in months in volatile trading as positive economic data from China and the United States fed hopes for demand despite nagging fears of a recession.Brent crude futures ended the day at $96.65 for a gain of 1.8%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled 1.97% higher at $90.76 per barrel. Last week, fears that a recession could dent energy demand pushed front-month Brent prices down 13.7% to their lowest since February. It was Brent's biggest weekly drop since April 2020, and WTI lost 9.7%.Both contracts recouped some losses on Friday after jobs growth in the United States, the world's top oil consumer, unexpectedly accelerated in July.""Once again the macro influences have seeped back into this market especially as it relates to Friday's employment number the economics of that should be giving us much better gasoline demand than we're seeing,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.On Sunday, China also surprised markets with faster-than-expected growth in exports.China, the world's top crude importer, brought in 8.79 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July, up from a four-year low in June, but still 9.5% less than a year earlier, customs data showed.In Europe, Russian crude and oil products exports continued to flow ahead of an impending embargo from the European Union that will take effect on Dec. 5.Last week, the Bank of England warned of a protracted recession in Britain.In terms of U.S. production, energy firms last week cut the number of oil rigs by the most since September in the first drop in 10 weeks.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they believe the case for higher oil prices remains strong, with the market remaining in a larger deficit than they expected in recent months."
2022-08-08,"The only thing I'd say about Friday's incredibly strong jobs report is that it makes far more sense that it was strong than that it would have been extremely weak. And anyone who is confused that it was strong is really confused in a much larger sense about what's actually going on with this economy.  The U.S. economy is and has been running too hot and not too cold. Think about it this way: Nominal GDP - Inflation = Real GDP. Inflation has been hitting 9% in recent months, which itself is evidence that we are running too hot, because if it were just a food/energy/supply chain/Ukraine story, high prices in those areas would, all else equal, create lower prices elsewhere. Instead, we have a massive rise in the entire, broad price level.  Anyhow, point being, if inflation is 9%, think about just how high nominal GDP has to be running in order to keep real GDP positive. Very, very high, is the answer. Last year, for example, nominal GDP surged 10.1%. In the fourth quarter alone, it soared a massive, mind-boggling, 14.5% (annualized)! How on God's green Earth is the U.S. economy exploding with that kind of ""growth""? Because of the massive Fed and fiscal stimulus that poured into the pandemic-hit economy. The problem is, and here's where those who say the economy is actually very weak are in some sense correct--this economy is nowhere near equipped to grow at a nominal 15% or 10% rate, or honestly even 5%, sustainably. In fact, potential GDP is so bad now, because of low population and productivity growth, that we probably can't sustain nominal GDP much higher than 3% or 4% in the long run. So if we explode by 10% or 15% because of massive government stimulus, it all goes into higher prices instead of higher real economic activity. One ""version"" of this problem is manifested in the too-strong labor market. Yep--too strong. There are too many job openings, a problem compounded by too much ""phantom demand"" caused by all the stimulus, and also by the lack of normal immigrant workers for political and pandemic reasons. We never used to see half a million jobs added per month last cycle--literally, for like fifteen years after the financial crisis, the strongest we ever saw was a couple months in roughly the 400,000 range. And yes, we've needed to refill the gap of workers who were laid off when the pandemic hit. The leisure and hospitality sectors are still 9% smaller, implying they should be adding more workers than normal for quite some time. But the internet and crypto and home furnishings and warehouse sectors, on the other hand, grew at unsustainable rates and are shifting into layoff or stabilization mode. As even President Biden has acknowledged, we need to be seeing the pace of job growth slow to more like 150,000 a month to be sustainable. Instead, we added 528,000 jobs last month. Which makes sense, because the weekly new jobless claims filings are still pretty low by historical standards, even if they've been creeping up from last year's unsustainably low levels. And job openings, even though they dropped a lot in the latest report, are still pointing to a massive need for workers--if nominal GDP keeps going this strong. And sure enough, MKM's Michael Darda thinks it could still be running at a double-digit pace right now, using his proxy of average weekly payrolls. Think about that! How is inflation supposed to collapse back to 2% next year, as many economists and investors have asserted on our show, if nominal GDP is still two or three times as high as is sustainable? Of course the Fed has to keep tightening aggressively right now. And as our Bob Pisani eloquently points out, the stock market hasn't even fallen out of bed as a result. In fact, the S&P 500 is up 14% since the Fed's first 75-basis-point rate hike in mid-June. I pointed this out in late June, as well: the Fed's super-sized hike was having exactly the effect you'd hope for across markets. Commodity prices have fallen substantially, but stock prices are higher. In terms of those warning it would cause financial market stress, credit markets look plenty open for business--Facebook parent Meta just did its first-ever bond offering last week, $10 billion in size, and it was triple-subscribed. Ten more companies are potentially offering today, according to Bloomberg, and $120 billion of new debt overall has been sold in just the past three weeks.  This is not a ""puzzling...shape-shifting economy changing its look from one week to the next,"" or one that's ""rewriting the rules."" It's just one we haven't seen in a long, long time. Fortunately, Fed policy makers seem now seem to understand its true, inflationary, overheating nature. No one can predict if their tightening will result in an actual, end-of-business-cycle recession next year, as yield curves are suggesting. But if the Fed doesn't tackle the actual inflation and overheating economy we have now, we'll all be a lot worse off for it. See you at 1 p.m! KellyTwitter: @KellyCNBCInstagram: @realkellyevans"
2022-08-08,"Democratic lawmakers celebrated on Sunday as the Senate narrowly passed sweeping economic and climate change legislation following a 51-50 party-line vote. The bill, called the Inflation Reduction Act, now heads to the House where it's expected to pass, and then likely on to President Joe Biden's desk for signing.  Although the bill has ""inflation reduction"" right there in the title, its policies are unlikely to put a lid on rising prices in the near future, says Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. ""Over the short run, fluctuations in energy, food and housing prices will set what happens to inflation this year,"" he says.The legislation authorizes $430 billion in spending, the bulk of which — $300 billion — is earmarked for investments to curb climate change and boost clean energy.The bill also allows Medicare to negotiate prices with drug companies for certain expensive drugs, theoretically reducing prescription costs for seniors, and extends Affordable Care Act subsidies to negate a planned 2023 hike in insurance premiums.Helping to fund the changes are a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and an excise tax on companies that repurchase shares of their own stock. The task of reducing inflation over the short term falls largely to the Federal Reserve, which has embarked on a series of interest rate hikes aimed at cooling rising costs. By making it more expensive to borrow money, the thinking goes, the Fed can slow the consumer spending that propels the economy.The Fed's moves have a gradual effect on inflation, economists say, but for consumers, some side-effects are more immediate: Borrowers pay more for loans, such as mortgages, and to run balances on their credit cards.Although the new bill doesn't take nearly as targeted of an approach to fighting inflation, it does aim to reduce the prices consumers pay in one key area: health care. ""Health-care costs are an important driver of inflation in this country,"" says Adams, adding that the U.S. is unique among developed economies in the amount it spends on health care compared to the outcomes its citizens receive.""From a 35,000-foot view, controlling health-care cost increases can bring down inflation over the next three to five years,"" he says.In addition to letting Medicare negotiate drug prices on behalf of consumers, the bill limits out-of-pocket prescription costs for Medicare beneficiaries to $2,000 per year. And if drug companies raise prices faster than inflation, they'll owe rebates to Medicare — presumably a deterrent to the sort of price hikes that can cripple the budgets of older Americans.  Still, opponents of the bill say that authorizing a huge spending bill will add to inflation rather than combatting it.""Naming it 'anti-inflation' is a joke,"" Kevin O'Leary, chairman of O'Shares ETFs and judge on CNBC's ""Money Court,"" told CNBC's Squawk Box on Monday.

Asian exporters will face significant challenges as demand from major markets like the U.S., Europe and China slow down in the coming months, according to the chief Asia economist of HSBC.Manufacturers in Europe are already pulling back quite significantly, namely in Germany, Frederic Neumann told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday.""Remember that Europe is a major export market for Asian exporters,"" the economist pointed out.""We also expect essentially a decline in shipments coming through the second half of the year, which complements the pivot in U.S. spending away from goods. Both of the U.S. and Europe slowing down is going to be headwinds for Asian exporters,"" he added. The slowdown in China's economy will further add to the problems facing exporters in the region, Neumann said.""Very clearly the trade data… shows this weakness in domestic demand. China is the third big export market that we really need to be humming — that too looks like it's not really picking up steam. From that perspective, a trade recession cannot be ruled out at this point,"" he added. China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 49.0 in July from 50.2 in June, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said last week.PMI readings are sequential and represent month-on-month expansion or contraction. A reading above 50 suggest growth while anything below 50 indicates contraction. China, which saw its economy grow only 0.4% year-over-year in the second quarter, is a key export market for many Asian countries. Therefore, a slowdown in the world's second largest economy will have an overall impact on the entire region.""The manufacturing sector is really the most brittle part of the global economy at the moment,"" said Neumann.""That's where we're seeing the first signs of weakness coming through whether in the U.S., whether in mainland China, whether in Europe,"" he said, adding the slowdown will have a trickle down effect on Asia's growth.

2022-08-09,"July's consumer price index is expected to show that inflation is coming off its peak and price gains may slow in coming months.That would be perceived as good news in the markets, where investors are watching the CPI for clues at to how much the Fed might raise interest rates at its September meeting.Falling gasoline prices are a big factor behind forecasts for lower July CPI, which is expected to dip to a headline pace of 8.7% year-over-year from 9.1% in June. Inflation may finally be cooling, thanks to falling gasoline prices and fading supply chain issues.Economists expect July's consumer price index rose 0.2%, down from 1.3% in June, according to Dow Jones. Year-over-year, the pace of consumer inflation in July is expected to fall to 8.7%, down from June's 9.1%.CPI is reported at 8:30 a.m ET Wednesday, and is expected to show that inflation has finally peaked. Investors are also closely watching the report for clues as to how aggressive the Federal Reserve might be in raising interest rates to fight rising prices.""You have about four drivers of inflation right now. You have commodity prices. That's going away. You have supply chain issues. That's going away, but you're still left with housing and the labor market, and that's going to show up in services inflation,"" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. ""You still have a problem with services inflation, and that's driven by shortages in housing and labor. That's not going away any time soon, until the Fed manages to destroy demand and that hasn't happened.""Excluding energy and food, CPI is expected to rise by 0.5% in July as rents and services prices rose, but that is down from 0.7% in June. Core CPI is still expected to be higher than June on a year-over-year basis, gaining 6.1% from June's 5.9%. ""Everyone is primed for reasonably good news, so it's got to be good news. If it's not as good as people think, it's going to be unusually bad news,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.Zandi said he expects headline inflation to rise just 0.1%. ""That would put year-over-year at 8.7%, uncomfortably high, painfully high but moving in the right direction. I think the 9.1% inflation rate we suffered in June will be the peak...a lot of this depends on oil prices,"" he said.Inflation expectations fallingThe report comes as both consumer and market expectations for inflation are falling. A survey from the New York Federal Reserve this week showed that consumers expected inflation to run at a 6.2% pace over the next year and a 3.2% annual rate for the next three years. That is a big decline from the respective 6.8% and 3.6% results in a June survey.""That's one of the most positive aspects of the inflation situation — inflation expectations have come in. Consumer expectations have come in, not surprising with lower gasoline prices,"" said Zandi.

According to Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, the 10-year breakeven is now 2.50%, down from a high of 3.07% earlier this year.That means that market participants now expect a rate of inflation that averages 2.50% annually over the next 10 years. Lyngen said the risks around the July CPI tilt toward an even lower number than expected.""There's just too many wild cards for us to have a particularly strong opinion, other than to say this is consistent with peak inflation and will be traded as such,"" he said. One wild card is oil and, while it has been falling lately, market views diverge on what will happen later in the year. The price is highly dependent on geopolitical events and how much the global economy slows. August has seen some of the lowest prices for oil since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with West Texas Intermediate crude futures trading at around $90 Tuesday, well off the March near $130 per barrel.In June, the CPI energy index rose 7.5%, with gasoline alone rising 11.2%.Gasoline prices fell through the month of July and are down about 20% from the June 14 peak of $5.01 per gallon. The average national price for a gallon of unleaded was $4.03 per gallon Tuesday, according to AAA.Housing costs are expected to have continued to rise in July. In June, the rent index rose 0.8%, the largest monthly increase since April 1986.""That's not coming in. That will remain persistently high, at least through next year. We may see the worst acceleration of housing costs by the end of the year,"" said Zandi.Zandi said that dual improvement in supply and cooling of demand mean rents could eventually moderate.""One reason is because demand is hurt. People can't pay these rents....and the other is supply. Multifamily construction is strong,"" the economist said.""That will show up in housing CPI, but it won't be until next year,"" he said. ""That will add about a half a point to inflation going forward for the foreseeable future. We have inflation settling at 2.5% on CPI, in spring of 2024. But a half point of that is housing.""Markowska said consumers got a break in July travel costs, which have fallen from the highest pace of the spring and summer. In July, she expects the CPI airfare index to decline by 7.7% month-over-month, taking 0.1% from core CPI.So far, Markowska said car prices do not seem to be coming down. ""We seem to have extremely low inventory levels. I'm not looking for big gains there. Used car prices, they've been up two months in a row. I think they post another increase this month and new car prices will be up as well,"" she said. She added prices do seem to be stabilizing. ""I think a lot of folks were expecting we would reverse some of the price gains.""She said supply chain issues have been easing. ""You see that pretty clearly in a lot of indicators — ISM indices, prices paid are declining, delivery times are shortening. Traffic on the Pacific is below levels we saw last year. We're actually in a peak shipping period as well. Everything seems to be moving in the right direction,"" she said.Economists say it is important the Federal Reserve sees inflation abating. But this is just one report, and the Fed will also be looking at the next jobs report for August and the August CPI before it raises interest rates again in September.Lyngen said all of those numbers will decide whether the Fed hikes 50 basis points, as had been expected before Friday's strong jobs report, or 75 basis points, in line with the June and July increases. The economy added 528,000 jobs in July, double what economists had forecast. A basis point equals 0.01 of a percentage point."
2022-08-09,"The Bank of England warned last week that the U.K. economy will enter its longest recession since the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter, leading GDP 2.1% lower.In a research note Monday, Saxo Bank's head of macro analysis, Christopher Dembik, said the U.K. is ""more and more looking like an emerging market country.""The only factor missing from a characterization as an EM country, Dembik said, is a currency crisis, with the British pound holding firm. Political instability, trade disruptions, an energy crisis and skyrocketing inflation are rendering the U.K. an ""emerging market country,"" according to Saxo Bank.The Bank of England warned last week that the U.K. economy will enter its longest recession since the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter, leading GDP 2.1% lower. Meanwhile, inflation is projected to peak above 13% in October.Importantly, the central bank is not anticipating a sharp rebound from the recession, and sees GDP remaining 1.75% below today's levels in mid-2025. In a research note Monday, Saxo Bank's head of macro analysis, Christopher Dembik, said the U.K. is ""more and more looking like an emerging market country.""A new prime minister will be announced Sept. 5 after Boris Johnson's resignation, with Conservative candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak vying for the keys to 10 Downing St. as the country faces a historic cost-of-living crisis and the sharpest fall in living standards on record.The U.K.'s energy price cap is set to rise by another 70% in October, pushing energy bills above £3,400 ($4,118) per year and driving millions of households into poverty, with a further increase to the cap expected early next year. The country has also been battling trade disruptions due to Brexit and Covid-related bottlenecks.The only factor missing from a characterization as an emerging market country, Dembik said, is a currency crisis, with the British pound holding firm despite the litany of macroeconomic headwinds.""It only dropped 0.70% against the euro and 1.50% against the U.S. dollar over the past week. Our bet: after surviving Brexit uncertainty, we don't see what could push the sterling pound into a free fall.""However, he suggested that all leading indicators point to more pain ahead for the British economy. For instance, new car registrations — often perceived as a leading indicator of the health of the British economy — fell from 1.835 million in July 2021 to 1.528 million last month.""This is the lowest level since the end of the 1970s. The recession will be long and deep. There won't be an easy escape. This is most worrying, in our view. The Bank of England assesses the slump will last with GDP still 1.75% below today's levels in mid-2025,"" Dembik said.  ""What Brexit has not done by itself, Brexit coupled with Covid and high inflation have succeeded in doing. The U.K. economy is crushed.""The one solace, according to the Danish investment bank, is that the Bank of England's expected interest rate hike in September — which would be its seventh in a row — could be the last.""Outside of the jobs markets, there are signs that some of the key inflation drivers may be starting to ease,"" Dembik said. ""In addition, the prospect of a long recession (five negative quarters of GDP starting in Q4 2022 all the way through to Q4 2023) will certainly push the Bank of England into a wait-and-see position.""The 'social contract is broken'However, the bank suggested that there are longer-term implications to the current crisis.""Imagine the graduate entering the workforce in 2009/10, who will have been told this was a once-in-a-lifetime crash. They are now in their early 30s and having yet another once-in-a-lifetime economic crisis,"" Dembik said. ""They faced an economy of suppressed wages, no housing prospects, two years of socializing lost to lockdown, obscene energy bills and rent and now a lengthy recession. This will lead to more poverty and despair.""The Bank of England has projected real household post-tax disposable income will fall 3.7% across 2022 and 2023, with low-income households the hardest hit, and Dembik highlighted the IMF's recent findings that the U.K.'s poorest households are among the hardest hit in Europe by the cost-of-living spike."

Pakistan's finance minister said the government has taken steps that will put the country on the right track and help the South Asian nation avoid an economic collapse. But that will cause pain for its people, he added.The country is desperately fighting for its survival as the recent rise in commodity and energy prices have exacerbated its debt problems. It has been struggling to pay for its imports as its official liquid foreign exchange reserves shrank by $754 million to $8.57 billion in the week ended July 22, according to the country's central bank data.""There were serious worries about Pakistan heading Sri Lanka's way, Pakistan getting into a default-like situation, but thankfully, we've made some significant changes.

If we had gone the Sri Lankan way this would have been much worse,"" the minister said. Pakistan is facing a serious debt crisis similar to foreign exchange shortage problems that has plagued its South Asian neighbor Sri Lanka this year.Sri Lanka has been battling shortages of food and fuel amid the worst economic crisis since the island nation's independence in 1948. The country has defaulted on its debt and has asked for relief from the International Monetary Fund.But unlike Sri Lanka, Pakistan was able to avert bankruptcy by striking a deal with the IMF in July. The country reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF to restart their stalled extended fund facility.Islamabad will get a first tranche of $1.17 billion from the IMF in the coming weeks, with further loans possible in the months ahead.""Pakistan is at a challenging economic juncture. A difficult external environment combined with procyclical domestic policies fueled domestic demand to unsustainable levels,"" the IMF said in a statement.""IMF has identified a $4 billion funding gap, which is to say that IMF wants our reserves to increase by $6 billion during this very challenging fiscal year,"" Ismail said. ""And of that $6 billion, it says that we have $2 billion and we should try and get $4 billion from our friends. We are mostly there and I think that within a day or two we'll actually have that number."" In July, Pakistan's headline inflation soared to 24.93% year on year, according to official data — the highest level since October 2008.In his budget speech in June, the finance minister highlighted that the government aimed to lower prices by using monetary and fiscal policy in a better way.""I think that wheat prices are coming down, commodity prices are coming down. Core inflation in Pakistan is still about 12 or 13%, no matter what the headline number is,"" Ismail told CNBC.""We've stopped monetary expansion. Our interest rates are quite high now, I think. We should be able to bring back inflation to about where the core inflation is,"" he added.The government needed to curtail its imports to bring down oil demand for energy-related items such as fuel and petrol, the finance minister said.""Now that the imports have come down, the pressure has eased against the Pakistani rupee. In fact, its appreciated about 7% against the U.S. dollar last week. We will see now inflation really taper off,"" he said.Looking ahead, Ismail said, it is ""very difficult"" to give a time frame for when things will improve for Pakistan, though he added that prospects are bright for the economy in the coming months.""I should think that in the second quarter of this fiscal year, which starts in October, we should be able to get handle of the economy. Our three months number of current account deficits will have come down. Markets will have more belief in our austerity measures. And things will start looking better.""Correction: This report has been updated to accurately reflect Pakistan's official liquid foreign exchange reserves."
2022-08-10,"Prices of pork, a food staple in China, rose by 20.2% in July from a year ago. The month-on-month gain was the highest on record, according to official data accessed through Wind Information.However, China's headline consumer price index rose by 2.7% in July, missing expectations for a 2.9% increase, according to analysts polled by Reuters. ""Non-food prices actually declined in July [by 0.1%] from their June level, which reflects weak demand,"" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist, Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note. BEIJING — China's consumer price index hit a two-year high in July as pork prices rebounded, according to official data released Wednesday.Prices of pork, a food staple in China, rose by 20.2% in July from a year ago. It marked the first increase since September 2020, according to official data accessed through Wind Information.In fact, pork prices posted their largest month-on-month surge on record — up by 25.6%, the data showed.Farmers' reluctance to sell — in hopes of getting higher prices in the future — contributed to July's pork price surge, said Bian Shuyang, agricultural products analyst at Nanhua Futures, in a statement.Looking ahead, Bian expects it will be difficult for pork prices to surpass July's levels.Two Chinese holidays in September and October will help support consumer demand for pork, Bian said.According to the analyst, live hog producers are now operating at a profit, an indication of more supply to come. Pork prices have swung wildly over the last three years as hog farmers have had to battle deadly disease and many new producers.Fresh fruit and vegetable prices also jumped in July, up by 16.9% and 12.9% from a year ago, respectively, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. While food prices rose, Wednesday's inflation data continued to reflect lackluster demand in China's economy.The headline consumer price index rose by 2.7% in July, missing expectations for a 2.9% increase, according to analysts polled by Reuters. ""Non-food prices actually declined in July [by 0.1%] from their June level, which reflects weak demand,"" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist, Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.""The Covid outbreaks in many cities and the lack of further policy stimulus may have led to weaker growth in July,"" he said.Despite the summer holidays, the tourism price component only rose by 0.5% in July from a year ago.Covid outbreaks in the last few weeks have disrupted vacations with cancelled flights and venue closures in tourist spots ranging from Hainan island to the Tibetan plateau.

2022-08-10,"Detroit fell into bankruptcy amid auto industry globalization and local suburban sprawl.The city bounced back by attracting new investments by awarding tax abatements to commercial developers while raising consumption and property taxes on residents.Local residents say the changes have the potential to be beneficial, but also raise concerns over gentrification and displacement. A new wave of development is rippling through downtown Detroit.""Walking around Detroit in 2008 or 2009 is not the same as walking around in 2022,"" said Ramy Habib, a local entrepreneur. ""It is absolutely magnificent what happened throughout those 15 years.""Between 2010 and 2019, just 708 new housing structures went up in the city of Detroit, according to the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments. Much of the new construction traces back to the philanthropic wings of large local businesses. For example, Ford Motor is nearing completion of a 30-acre mixed-used development at Michigan Central Station. The station sat abandoned for years as the city fell into bankruptcy. Detroit's decline into insolvency formed amid 20th century globalization in the auto industry, according to economists. The city's population fell from 1.8 million to 639,000 in the most recent but controversial count by the U.S. Census. ""With the population leaving, with the infrastructure staying in place, it meant strains on the city. Cumulatively, they started to mount over time,"" said Raymond Owens III, a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.The 2007-08 Great Recession left another round of scars on the city as scores of homes fell into foreclosure. The U.S. Treasury Department has since funded the removal of 15,000 blighted structures in the city. ""A lot of Black people are leaving the city. So sometimes that identity can change and shift in certain communities,"" said Alphonso Carlton Jr, a lifelong Detroit resident.Local leaders have used tax and spending policies to advance economic development downtown. In July 2022, the Detroit City Council finalized a tax abatement for the real estate developer Bedrock to finance the $1.4 billion Hudson's site project. The abatement could be worth up to $60 million over its 10-year span. Bedrock is in a family of companies controlled by billionaire investor Dan Gilbert, who moved several of his businesses downtown in 2010.Bedrock told CNBC that decision was consistent with the council's handling of other major developments, due to high local tax rates. One local analysis suggests that in 2020, Detroit's effective property tax rate on homes was more than double the national average. Detroit's new tax, spending and placemaking policies have drawn the interests of bond investors in recent years, providing another source of revenue for the local government.

2022-08-11,"New technology can hold down or even reduce costs of energy, technology and labor.Recent data on short-term productivity declines, and inflation up 8.5 percent in the last year, make the case for more investment in technology by corporations.Cloud computing, AI, e-commerce, renewable energy and EVs, and autonomous transportation are all examples of tech that may see a greater share of business spending. As inflation keeps flirting with 40-year highs, we know what the Fed is doing to fight back: raise interest rates. But what can businesses do to fight back beyond raising prices on customers?That question is newly relevant with the latest inflation data on Wednesday. It was a sign that the economy is making progress against inflation. The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 8.5 percent for the 12 months that ended in July, which represented a leveling off of inflation much better than in recent months, driven by the falling price of gasoline after a surge that began in December 2020. Gas prices dropped nearly 8 percent in July. The rate of inflation excluding volatile food and energy segments climbed 0.3 percent, down from 0.7 percent in June.But can corporate America and the markets count on the inflation lull to last?""This is a much better report than what I expected,"" former Obama administration chief economist Jason Furman told CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday. ""This could easily be the false dawn that we saw in September 2021, but for now I'll take it as a tick in the good direction.""Ann Milleti, Allspring Global Investments head of active equity, told CNBC on Wednesday that there's a sense of relief from the latest inflation data, but in the bigger picture, she cautioned that inflation is here to stay. ""What you want to own are companies that can outperform, management teams who have lived through previous cycles before, cycles that are changing,"" Milleti said. ""Regardless of what the Fed does, we know rates are going higher. We know that inflation is likely to be higher than it was over the last decade in the next decade. So you want to pick companies that are better positioned for that type of environment than the previous environment we have lived through."" One set of answers to the higher-for-longer inflation argument circulating on Wall Street comes from Morgan Stanley, in the form of a 60-page report released this summer called ""The Deflation Enablers."" Led by industrial research director Josh Pokrzywinski, the report makes the case that a big change is coming in how corporations think about allocating capital after the end of the low interest rate era.""The cost of capital is on the rise, which we think will push companies to invest for future growth as opposed to corporate buybacks and other financial engineering,"" the Morgan Stanley report says. ""Physical [capital spending], when executed right, tends to be deflationary.""This belief led a team of 31 credited analysts to come up with a series of investments that companies – and investors – should be focusing on as executives allocate more spending for productivity gains and to drive inflation lower over the next several years.The Morgan Stanley report is dominated by technologies whose names have become familiar: artificial intelligence, clean energy, robotics, software innovation and even clean commercial heating and air conditioning advancements that can quickly pay for themselves in efficiency savings. All of these technologies are dropping quickly in price and ramping up in effectiveness, and that implies that goods and services made with them will be significantly cheaper over the next several years. Some of the examples Morgan Stanley cites are familiar; others much less so.AI, for example, has little-appreciated importance to accelerating the advance of biotechnology and pharmaceutical development, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Vikram Purahit, letting companies eliminate unpromising experiments quickly and hone in faster on compounds that are clinically promising, cutting time for preclinical drug development as much as 75% and reducing early-stage development costs by up to half. Another is in the seemingly low-tech business of long-haul trucking. Labor and fuel costs have been driving freight costs to new highs. The Labor Department reported that costs for delivery services like United Parcel Service and FedEx have risen 14 percent in the last 12 months and wages in the sector have accelerated amid a shortage of drivers. But trucks that use autonomous-driving technology and electric engines can solve both problems, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shankar. Near-fully autonomous driving should be available by late next year from San Diego-based TuSimple, which went public in 2021 and is partly owned by United Parcel Service. FedEx chairman Fred Smith told CNBC's Jim Cramer in March that his company wants to introduce driverless trucks in 2022, and Fedex announced a pilot AV program in May.""We believe 70 percent of cost savings are in play from the adoption of these technologies together,"" Shankar wrote, and he added, ""We expect at least some of these to be passed along to shippers.""But the biggest bucket of investment to fight inflation may occur in energy. There's an emerging split between ""inflationary"" traditional energy and ""deflationary"" clean energy, wrote Morgan Stanley utility analyst Stephen Byrd, a split highlighted by this year's surge in oil and natural gas prices. One example: Futures prices for electricity supplied to Texas in 2023 are up 65 percent this year, while fuel cell manufacturer Bloom Energy is cutting manufacturing costs as much as 10 percent a year. Electricity supplied by Bloom to commercial customers is now almost 20 percent cheaper than the national average, Byrd said. Similarly, power generated by Sunrun's rooftop solar systems in California is now cheaper than juice from the local utility, thanks to a big jump in utility inflation in the last year. The new inflation data did not show a deceleration in utility prices, partly because the market price of natural gas remains three times higher than pre-pandemic levels, complicated by disruptions in Russian supplies.""Clean energy can, in the long term, be disruptive to traditional electricity suppliers, especially utilities with high and rising customer bills, above-average exposure to physical risks from climate change, and challenges in ensuring adequate power supply to its customers,"" Byrd wrote. The report met with a mixed reaction from outside experts. The basic idea is well-known to those who follow innovation: technology is by its nature deflationary.""[It's an] interesting piece,'' said Michael Mandel, chief economist of the Progressive Policy Institute and lead author of its Innovation Heroes reports, highlighting companies that invest heavily to chase productivity gains. ""[It] fits very closely to our Investment Heroes report, and [with] low inflation in the digital sector."" Mandel argues that inflation has spiked partly because of low investment by corporations during the Covid pandemic. But less impressed was Robert Cantwell, portfolio manager of the Compound Kings ETF in Nashville, who thinks Morgan Stanley's analysts went too far in the number of technologies cited.""Deflationary advancements don't come from capital intensive activities like the renewable energy transition or EVs,"" Cantwell  said. ""Capital-light technology, like card networks and social networks, have deflationary potential, but it's really hard to measure.""None of this means policy makers and markets can take their eye off short-term inflation pressures, said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs, whose funds focus on disruptions including quantum computing and hydrogen energy.""Politics, Washington, and the Federal Reserve have arguably the largest impact on the state of inflation, and this cannot be ignored,"" Jablonski said. ""However, there are a lot of factors which can contribute to demographic trends, lead to a technological revolution and really shift the way that the economy and society operate. """
2022-08-11,"Singapore's economy expanded less than initially estimated in the second quarter and the government revised its growth projections for 2022 lower, flagging risks to the global outlook from the Ukraine war and inflation.Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said, slower than the 4.8% growth seen in the government's advance estimate.""Downside risks in the global economy remain significant...further escalations in the Russia-Ukraine conflict could worsen global supply disruptions and exacerbate inflationary pressures through higher food and energy prices,"" said Gabriel Lim, permanent secretary of MTI at a media briefing.The weaker growth was partly due to the slowdown in electronics manufacturing, according to MTI. The ministry said weakness in China's economic outlook, a key market for petroleum and chemicals products, had also adversely affected Singapore's growth prospects.The Southeast Asian financial hub is often seen as a bellwether for global growth as international trade dwarfs its domestic economy.On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the economy contracted 0.2%, compared with the government's advance 0% estimate and the 0.8% growth in the first quarter.""Our current baseline is that GDP will return to a slight positive (quarter-on-quarter) growth in the third and fourth quarter of this year,"" said Yong Yik Wei, chief economist of MTI at the media briefing ""So in other words we do not expect technical recession.""

And until we see signs, which is tight labor markets cooling off, that would still drive cost pressures in the Singapore economy,"" she said.""The defensive move for MAS is to tighten in October.

2022-08-11,"Analysis by CNBC shows Beijing's new trade blocks against Taiwan affect only about 0.04% of their two-way trade.Beijing's retaliations against U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan earlier this month include suspensions of imports of Taiwanese citrus, frozen fish, sweets and biscuits and exports of natural sands to Taiwan. While mainland China and Taiwan's trade should be largely unaffected by the new measures, heightened military drills in the Taiwan Strait may delay shipments, analysts say.  Beijing's new trade blocks against Taiwan affect about 0.04% of their two-way trade, making them more political than economic. Beijing took action against Taiwan following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island earlier this month despite warnings from Beijing. That included suspensions of imports of Taiwanese citrus, frozen fish, sweets and biscuits and exports of natural sands to Taiwan. Taiwan is a self-ruled democracy, but Beijing considers the island part of its territory and a breakaway province. China says Taiwan has no right to conduct foreign relations and warned for weeks against Pelosi's visit. Taiwan's exports to mainland China were worth $113 billion last year and its imports from China amounted to about $82 billion, excluding re-exports and re-imports, according to figures from the Taiwanese trade bureau.A bulk of that was in electrical machinery, electronic and technological parts, which Beijing has not targeted. When it comes to Taiwan's imports from mainland China, more than half of the $82 billion traded in 2021 were electrical machinery, electronic and technological parts as well as nuclear reactors and boilers.As for Taiwan's exports to China, 65% of them were also similar goods in electrical machinery, electronic and technological parts. On the other hand, the volume of trade in areas that Beijing has targeted is relatively small.Exports of natural sand to Taiwan — which Beijing has targeted — were a drop in the ocean against the above figures. They amounted to about $3.5 million last year, data from the Taiwanese trade bureau showed.  They were also a small trade compared with natural sand exports from Australia and Vietnam, the biggest suppliers of natural sand to Taiwan last year. Together, they supplied about $64 million of the raw material used in construction and other industries, making up 70% of Taiwan's purchases, according to its trade bureau.Similarly, the targeted trade of citrus was valued at a relatively small $10 million last year, though mainland China was also Taiwan's biggest citrus buyer, Taiwan's trade data showed. Other targets such as Taiwan's exports of bread, pastry, cakes and biscuits to mainland China were worth more than $50 million in total last year.Beijing's specific suspension of two kinds of frozen fishes, horse mackerel and largehead hairtail, were valued at over $3 million in 2021, according to Taiwan's trade bureau.""China's economic retaliation against Taiwan is a long-standing strategy in its diplomatic playbook. That said, its decision to target relatively low-value trade items reflects the limits of its economic pressure toolbox,"" said global trade lead analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, Nick Marro. ""It's already had restrictions on Chinese visitors to Taiwan in place for a few years, which carry more economic significance; the agricultural products now in the headlines are only a fraction of Taiwan's export basket. And so the headline impact on Taiwan won't really be noticeable."" Beijing's trade suspensions against Taiwan are not a new phenomenon. In previous years, tensions between the two have led to bans on mainland travelers to Taiwan.Last year, China suspended imports of Taiwanese pineapples, citing quarantine measures over ""harmful creatures"" that came with the fruit. China was Taiwan's biggest pineapple buyer up to that point.  Investment bank Natixis said that the recent Chinese trade restrictions focused on ""highly replaceable food products"" but not the information and communications technology sector in which the two trading partners have the most trade. The bank also said mainland China will continue to import from Taiwan as long as it needs the goods, similar to what it has done in other trade conflicts such as the one it has with Australia and the United States.In the China-Australia trade dispute that started in 2020, China restricted the purchase of some goods such as barley and coal but continued to buy iron ore from Australia, a key ingredient for China's steel production and the bedrock of the countries' trade. There may also be other fallouts from the Pelosi visit that could hurt wider regional trade. For example, heightened military drills in the Taiwan Strait may delay shipments, analysts say.  ""The shutting down of these transport routes — even temporarily — has consequences not only for Taiwan, but also trade flows tied to Japan and South Korea,"" Marro said. ""It's not just a story for Taiwan and China, but also for their neighbors, as well.""Analysis by logistics platform Container xChange said any rerouting of shipping lines to avoid military exercises may be problematic for the trading world as it enters peak shipping season.Container xChange Chief Executive Christian Roeloffs said, however, that supply chains have become far more resilient over the course of the pandemic.Customer feedback shows any rerouting of vessels away from the Taiwan Strait will add a few days to ship voyages, though Roeloffs does not anticipate a massive hit to logistics costs. "
2022-08-12,"China's island province of Hainan announced a 9% GDP growth target for this year back in January.The tourist-heavy island's economy underperformed the national growth level in the first half of the year as Covid controls and travel restrictions discouraged visitors.This month, a surge in Covid infections this month forced Hainan's oceanside resort city of Sanya to order tens of thousands of tourists to stay put at their hotels, and local residents to stay at home.Hainan's economy underperformed the national GDP of 2.5% in the first half of 2022, growing only by 1.6% in the same period. BEIJING — China's tourist-heavy province of Hainan is falling further behind lofty growth goals it set in January.Back then, the island said it aimed for 9% GDP growth this year. But like China's economy overall, growth is running far below initial targets — due in a large part to outbreaks of a far more transmissible Covid variant.A surge in Covid infections this month forced Hainan's oceanside resort city of Sanya to order tens of thousands of tourists to stay put at their hotels, and local residents to stay at home. Haikou, the province's capital, also issued stay-home orders.Airlines cancelled flights, leaving tourists stranded on Hainan island since Saturday. In the last few days, some people have been able to return to the mainland on government-organized charter flights.But questions remain — about uniform implementation of hotel stay subsidies, the cost of food and how soon most tourists can return to their homes. ""The public image and reputation of Hainan is damaged for the short term,"" said Jacques Penhirin, a partner in the Greater China office of Oliver Wyman. ""When I talk to the client they're all looking at the bookings for [the upcoming fall holiday] which are still quite resilient. People have not cancelled yet, but it's not looking good. Probably down on last year.""It's ""going to be bad for luxury brands and hospitality at least until Chinese New Year next year,"" he said, referring to the Lunar New Year holiday in late January 2023. In late July, China's top leaders indicated the country might miss the GDP target of around 5.5% set in March. Beijing did not signal any large-scale stimulus, or any change to its ""dynamic zero-Covid"" policy.The national economy grew by just 2.5% in the first half of the year, according to official figures. Hainan's economy underperformed even that sluggish pace, only growing by 1.6% in the first half of 2022.That's a sharp slowdown from the island's 11.2% GDP growth for all of 2021.In fact, Hainan's growth last year was second only to that of Hubei province, pointed out Ying Zhang, research analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

What to know about the new investing landscape ""Because of the international travel restriction, Hainan has benefited from the tourism revenue, up by nearly 60% last year,"" she said. Zhang estimates tourism accounts for more than 80% of Hainan's economy.Sanya, on the southern coast of Hainan, was the top destination for couples flying from three of China's largest cities last week for China's version of Valentine's Day, according to booking site Trip.com.The island boasts one of the few beachfront locations for international luxury hotels like Mandarin Oriental and Hyatt in mainland China.Hainan is also building out duty-free shopping malls as part of central government's push to turn the island into a free trade hub and international shopping area.Sales at duty-free stores on the island surged by 84% last year to 60.17 billion yuan ($8.93 billion), according to official figures.During a consumer goods expo in Hainan in late July, sales at four duty-free stores rose by 27% year-on-year to 330 million yuan, the customs agency said. So far, cosmetics brands rely far more on Hainan for sales than affordable luxury brands — potentially up to a third of their China business, said Oliver Wyman's Penhirin. He said Hainan generally accounts for less than 5% of China sales for affordable luxury brands, while high-end luxury has yet to enter that market.An Oliver Wyman survey in May found that after roughly two months of lockdown in the metropolis of Shanghai, respondents from luxury and premium consumer brands cut their China growth expectations for the year by 15 percentage points. ""The question is definitely when will consumer regain confidence and peace of mind of travel and shopping which is further delayed by this Hainan incident,"" Penhirin said, noting he expects this month's lockdowns will be forgotten in one or two years.""It's more about the confidence than the income itself, especially for the luxury goods,"" he said.In the meantime, he said brands should put more effort to track their inventory in China, to make sure products aren't being sold at levels that might induce a price war."
2022-08-12,"Prolonged stress in China's real estate market would negatively affect different sectors to different degrees, according to analysis by Fitch Ratings.Their analysis identified three kinds of businesses most vulnerable to persistent troubles in Chinese real estate.While China has not necessarily entered such a stress scenario yet, Fitch said the recent mortgage strike could diminish confidence in the property market, delaying a recovery and causing ripple effects through the domestic economy.  BEIJING — China's real estate troubles could spill into other major sectors if the problems persist — and three particular businesses are most vulnerable, according to ratings agency Fitch.Since last year, investors have worried that Chinese property developers' financial problems could spread to the rest of the economy. In the last two months, many homebuyers' refusal to pay their mortgages have brought developers' problems to the forefront again — while China's economic growth slows.related investing newsSell this lithium stock with high exposure to the chemical's price, Goldman Sachs saysAlex Harring13 hours agoSlowdown, recession or boom? Bank of America reveals the global stocks to play each eventualityGanesh Raoa day ago""If timely and effective policy intervention does not materialise, distress in the property market will be prolonged and have effects on various sectors in China beyond the property sector's immediate value chain,"" Fitch analysts said in a report Monday.Under such a stress scenario, Fitch analyzed the impact over the next 12 to 24 months on more than 30 kinds of businesses and government entities. The firm found three that are most vulnerable to real estate's troubles:1. Asset management companiesThese firms ""hold a sizeable amount of assets that are backed by real estate-related collateral, making them highly exposed to prolonged property-market distress,"" the report said.2. Engineering, construction firms (non state-owned)“The sector in general has been in difficulty since 2021. ... They do not have competitive advantages in infrastructure project exposure or funding access relative to their [government-related] peers,"" the report said.3. Smaller steel producers""Many have been operating at a loss for a few months and could face liquidity issues if China's economy remains lacklustre, especially given the high leverage in the sector,"" the report said.Fitch said construction accounts for 55% of steel demand in China.The slowdown in real estate has already dragged down broader economic indicators like fixed asset investment and the furniture sales component of retail sales. Official data show residential housing sales fell by 32% in the first half of this year from a year ago, Fitch pointed out. The report cited industry research as indicating the 100 largest developers likely saw even worse performance — with sales down by 50%. While Fitch's base case assumes China's property sales will return to growth next year, the analysts warned that ""deterioration in homebuyers' confidence could stall the sales recovery momentum we saw in May and June."" Since late June, many homebuyers have suspended mortgage payments to protest construction delays for apartments they'd already paid for, putting developers' future sales and an important source of cash flow at risk. Developers in China typically sell homes before finishing them.""Fitch believes the recent rise in the number of homebuyers suspending mortgage payments over stalled projects underlines the potential for China's property crisis to deepen, as diminishing confidence could stall the sector's recovery, which will eventually ripple through the domestic economy,"" the report said.The analysis provided by Fitch generally found that large and central government-affiliated businesses were less vulnerable to a deterioration in real estate than smaller firms or those tied to local governments.Among banks, Fitch said small and regional banks — reflecting about 30% of banking system assets — face greater risks. But the ratings agency noted that risks for Chinese banks overall could rise if authorities significantly relax requirements for lending to troubled real estate developers. Businesses least vulnerable to real estate's problems were insurers, food and beverage companies, power grid operators and national oil companies, the report said. Chinese real estate developers came under increased pressure about two years ago when Beijing started to crack down on the companies' high reliance on debt for growth.Numbers like vacancy rates give a sense of how large the real estate problems are.

That's the highest on record, according to Wind data going back to 2018.Fu attributed the high level of youth unemployment to Covid's impact on businesses' operations and their ability to hire.In particular, he noted how the services sector, where young people typically account for a greater number of jobs, has recovered rather slowly. Fu also pointed to was young people's current preference for jobs with more stability.Stable jobs in China typically include those at state-owned enterprises rather than positions at start-ups or smaller companies.""The national economy maintained the momentum of recovery,"" the statistics bureau said in a statement.

What to know about the new investing landscape Analyst forecasts for July were projected to show a pickup in economic activity from June, as China put the worst of this year's Covid-related lockdowns behind it, especially in the metropolis of Shanghai.Exports remained robust last month, surging by 18% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms despite growing concerns of falling global demand. Imports lagged, climbing by just 2.3% in July from a year earlier.However, China's massive real estate sector has come under renewed pressure this summer. Many homebuyers halted their mortgage payments to protest developer delays in constructing homes, which are typically sold ahead of completion in China.The deterioration in confidence puts developers' future sales — and an important source of cash flow — at risk.Statistics spokesperson Fu described the construction delays as specific to some regions.He said the real estate market is ""in a stage of building a bottom"" and its impact on the economy will ""gradually improve.""Fu said in response to a separate question that once Covid is under control, consumers' pent up demand will be released.The potential for a Covid outbreak has remained another drag on sentiment. A surge of infections in tourist destinations, especially the island province of Hainan, stranded tens of thousands of tourists this month.The local situation reflects the large gap between goals set at the beginning of the year and the ensuing reality. Hainan had set a GDP target of 9%, but was only able to grow by 1.6% in the first six months.Similarly, at a national level, China's GDP grew by just 2.5% in the first half of the year, running well below the full-year target of around 5.5% set in March.When asked about the target Monday, Fu did not discuss it specifically.

After a series of relaxations by Beijing — including the easing of inter-provincial group travel bans and the curb of excessive local government mobility controls in June — traveler numbers leapt by over 62% month-on-month in July, Fitch Ratings said, citing official Chinese data. Data from online travel agencies such as Tuniu Corporation showed bookings surging 112% over July, Fitch said. The daily average tourists at Xinjiang's top-rated, or ""5A-level,"" tourist attractions skyrocketed to 110,000 in July compared with 19,000 in May, the Fitch analysts said. Yunnan's Dali city, a famous tourist spot, attracted 6.9 million tourists — a 46% jump from pre-pandemic levels in 2019, they said. The recent outbreaks in Hainan, Xinjiang and Tibet are unlikely to pull back the recovery in tourism as there are fewer travelers in these regions compared to the rest of the nation, the Fitch report said.But recovery, while robust, remains patchy across regions, in particular, short haul travel operators will do better than national scenic spot tourist companies which target national visitors, it added.Chinese consumers will continue to favor local and shorter trips amid the pandemic, the report said.The pandemic has also altered domestic Chinese tourism, business consultancy China Briefing said in a note last week.Group-travel destinations have lost some of their popularity as  Chinese travelers steer toward family vacations, health-care tours and research trips, it said.CTrip, China's leading online travel agent, said in its summer tourism report last month that ""parent-child"" or family travel, as opposed to traditional Chinese big bus tours, has increased.Signs of recovery have appeared across Chinese retail spending including tourism.New data on Monday shows July's retail spending increased 2.7% year-on-year following an unexpected 3.1% rise in June, although the latest result for July fell short of analysts' expectations of a rise of between 4% and 5%.These were the first increases in retail spending since February, as consumption picked up after Covid-19 infections and restrictions eased. In May, as Shanghai battled its worst lockdown, retail sales were down 6.7% year-on-year."

2022-08-16,"Tencent is expected to report second quarter revenue totaling 132.2 billion yuan ($19.5 billion), a more than 4% year-on-year decline, according to consensus forecasts from Refinitiv.A Covid-induced slowdown in the Chinese economy and continued challenges in the domestic gaming market could prove to be strong headwinds.Advertising and gaming could see pressure as brands cut back on ad dollars and consumer spending on gaming remains sluggish.Tencent is also dealing with a tougher regulatory environment for gaming in China. Tencent could post its first year-on-year revenue decline on record when it reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, according to analysts, as a Covid-induced slowdown in the Chinese economy and continued challenges in the domestic gaming market could prove to be strong headwinds for the company.The Chinese gaming and social media behemoth is expected to report June quarter revenue totaling 132.2 billion yuan ($19.5 billion), a more than 4% year-on-year decline, according to consensus forecasts from Refinitiv. Net income is forecast to fall nearly 30% to 23.8 billion yuan.related investing newsSell this lithium stock with high exposure to the chemical's price, Goldman Sachs saysAlex Harringa day agoTencent, which runs China's biggest messaging app WeChat, makes a large amount of revenue from gaming and advertising, two areas which are likely to have taken a hit in the second quarter.""We factor in more conservative assumptions to online games and advertising revenue in 2Q due to global macro-headwinds and the outbreak of the pandemic. We expect the headwinds to lead to softness in overseas gamers spending,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note published last month. During the April to June quarter, China saw a resurgence of Covid-19 that led to the lockdown of major cities, most notably the financial metropolis of Shanghai, as authorities continue with the country's ""Zero Covid"" policy.China's economy grew just 0.4% in the second quarter, missing analyst expectations. Macroeconomic headwinds are likely to lead to slower consumer spending plus a cutback in advertising, two areas Tencent relies on.For the April to June quarter, e-commerce giant Alibaba reported flat revenue growth for the first time on sluggish consumer spending.Jefferies forecasts that Tencent's online ad revenue declined 29% year-on-year in the second quarter to 16.3 billion yuan. That's a sharper drop than what was reported in the first quarter.""We expect the softness to have come from the outbreak of the pandemic and uncertainties in the macro environment, as well as the high base from certain industry categories (including education and gaming),"" Jefferies said. Gaming revenue, which accounts for about a third of Tencent's total sales, will be in focus for investors.China's gaming sector continues to face challenges. Last year, Chinese regulators said children below 18 years old will only be allowed to play online games for up to three hours a week and only during specific times.While Tencent has said in the past that minors only account for a tiny fraction of its revenue, some of the effects are being seen.Regulators also froze the approvals of new games in China from last July and only begun giving the green light for new titles in April again. In China, games need to be approved by regulators in order to be monetized. China has heavy censorship on the contents of games.Analysts at China Renaissance said in a note published last month that Tencent launched just three mobile games in the second quarter so there will be ""limited contribution"" to revenue from new titles. The analysts are forecasting ""flattish"" online gaming revenue in the second quarter with domestic gaming revenue to fall 3% and international game revenue to rise 8% year-on-year.Tencent and its rival NetEase have looked toward international gaming expansion as the domestic market has slowed, acquiring developers or opening new studios.Jefferies analysts are bullish on the future potential of Tencent's overseas drive.""Overseas, Tencent has a solid pipeline of about 30 titles that are to be released in the next few years,"" they said. ""On top of mobile games, Tencent also has console games in the pipeline. It pursues multi-pronged strategies in overseas expansion such as setting up local operations teams, self development as well as publishing."" Investors will be keeping their eye on a few more areas of Tencent's business.On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Tencent is planning to divest most of its $24 billion stake in food delivery giant Meituan. A source with knowledge of the matter told CNBC that Tencent has no plans currently to sell its stake. Investors will be hoping to hear from Tencent's executives on its plans in this area.Tencent's fintech and cloud business are also important areas for the company. Tencent runs one of China's biggest mobile payment platforms called WeChat Pay. China Renaissance said it forecasts just 2% year-on-year revenue growth for fintech due to the Covid resurgence.Growth of the cloud business could also be hampered due to ""project delays and softness in offline activities"" because of the pandemic, Jefferies said."
2022-08-16,"Moscow is working to recalibrate its economy in the face of a barrage of international sanctions imposed by Western powers in response to the war.The Russian economy shrunk by 4% year-on-year over the second quarter, although this was less sharp than the 5% expected by analysts. Although many economists are focusing on the long-term structural threats to the Russian economy – which the government and central bank are scrambling to counter – the more immediate collapse predicted by some has not come to fruition. Russia's economy contracted in the second quarter – the first full three months since the country's invasion of Ukraine – and economists are divided over whether it can continue to weather the onslaught of international sanctions in the long term.The Russian economy shrunk by 4% year-on-year over the second quarter, although this was less sharp than the 5% expected by analysts. The Central Bank of Russia expects the downturn to deepen in the quarters ahead, reaching its lowest point in the first half of 2023.It comes as Moscow scrambles to recalibrate its economy in the face of a barrage of sanctions imposed by Western powers in response to the war, which have disrupted trade and all but ostracized Russia from the global financial system.""There have been signs of stabilization in many sectors over the past month or two but we don't expect the downturn to bottom out until Q2 2023 and think the economy will stagnate at best thereafter,"" said Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.The immediate impact of sanctions was mitigated by swift action from the CBR to deploy capital control measures and hike interest rates sharply. The measures stabilized domestic markets and even saw the ruble become one of the top performing currencies in the world so far this year.Subsequently, fiscal stimulus measures and substantial cuts to interest rates have also taken effect, blunting the short-term impact of sanctions. Late last month, the central bank shocked with a 150 basis point reduction in Russia's key rate, taking it to 8% and marking the fifth consecutive cut since it launched an emergency hike from 9.5% to 20% in late February.""The downturn could have been much deeper but the central bank took immediate measures to prevent a financial crisis from taking hold. It also seems that the resilience of Russia's energy sector cushioned the impact of Western sanctions,"" Peach added. However, many economists consider the long-term damage to Russia's economy to be much more severe, as a flight of business and talent gradually compresses economic activity, along with a lack of access to critical technologies.Meanwhile, sanctions have hit some areas of the economy hard, with manufacturing output falling 4% quarter-on-quarter, and production in import-dependent sectors slumping more than 10%.Consumer demand has also weakened sharply; retail sales slid 11% quarter-on-quarter following March's brutal inflation shock, while consumer confidence collapsed and monetary conditions tightened.""Q3 is likely to be another weak quarter, albeit a smaller contraction than in Q2. The downturns in retail sales and manufacturing have softened, inflation has eased and monetary conditions have loosened,"" Peach said.""Even so, the economy still faces severe headwinds, including limited access to Western technology and a looming ban on the provision of insurance for shipping Russian oil, which we think will cause output to fall 10% next year.""Capital Economics does not expect Russian GDP to bottom out for another year or so.Floundering, not drowningAug. 24 will mark six months since global sanctions were first imposed on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 20. There are now over 11,000 international sanctions on the country.Although many economists are focusing on the long-term structural threats to the Russian economy – which the government and central bank are scrambling to counter – the more immediate collapse predicted by some has not come to fruition.""Despite the onslaught of sanctions, and the predictions of many observers, Russia's economy has not imploded and, although facing a contraction of 5-6% this year, is in no danger of collapse or likely to experience any form of an economic or financial crisis,"" said Chris Weafer, CEO of Moscow-based Macro-Advisory.""It is, however, facing 5 to 7 quarters of low single-digit decline and a lengthy list of challenges which, if not addressed effectively, will keep growth near stagnation for many years.""In a research note Friday, Weafer suggested that the Russian economy is ""floundering, not drowning.""Macro-Advisory estimates that the Russian state accounts for more than 60% of GDP, while small- and medium-sized enterprises make up less than 25%. This imbalance restricts growth during normal times but also insulates the economy during times of crisis, he added.""The government, companies, and people are used to economic crises (this is the fifth since 1991), and support structures, for employers and in the social spheres, are well developed,"" Weafer said.Meanwhile, business confidence, having dropped sharply in March and April, has returned to the long-term averages for both manufacturing and services. Weafer also disagreed with recent assessments that the economy is on a long road to ""oblivion,"" arguing that the mass exodus of Western companies from Russia would not be as detrimental to activity as widely assumed.""Most of those exiting are either small companies (such as in retail fashion) or have sold to local buyers. Of the Top 50 foreign-controlled companies, only three have shut down completely,"" he said.""Another three have sold to local buyers and 10 others have said they plan to sell to a local buyer. The others are staying. We calculate the hit to GDP at less than 1% because operational assets will remain in the country.""This stands in stark contrast to the ""catastrophic"" hit projected by a Yale University study published last month, which analyzed high-frequency consumer, trade and shipping data. The study's authors argue that sanctions and an exodus of more than 1,000 global companies are ""crippling"" the Russian economy.But Weafer is far from convinced. ""There is a great deal of skepticism about Russia's so-called resilience and ability, even willingness, to invest in localization, especially given how little has been done in such areas as technology, engineering, and specialist services over the past twenty years,"" Weafer added.""But as previous crises have shown, Russia usually addresses such problems when left with no other choice, and usually only then."""

I think that's the most important reason why we think inflation will come in control and central banks will not have to take policy rates into deeply restrictive territory.""Last week, Bank of Thailand Governor ​Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput said there's no need for the central bank to ""undertake heroically large rate hikes"" as the country's economy is only expected to return to pre-pandemic levels at the end of the year.

2022-08-17,"Tencent posted its first ever quarterly year-on-year revenue decline as stricter regulations around gaming in China and a resurgence of Covid-19 in the world's second-largest economy hit the technology giant.Tencent posted revenue of 134.03 billion Chinese yuan ($19.78 billion) in the second quarter vs. 134.6 billion yuan expected, a decline of 3% year-on-year. Tencent posted its first ever quarterly year-on-year revenue decline as stricter regulations around gaming in China and a resurgence of Covid-19 in the world's second-largest economy hit the technology giant.Here's how Tencent did in the second quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: Revenue: 134.03 billion Chinese yuan ($19.78 billion) vs. 134.6 billion yuan expected, a decline of 3% year-on-year.Profit attributable to equity holders of the company: 18.62 billion yuan vs. 25.28 billion yuan expected, a decline of 56% year-on-year.Tencent missed both revenue and profit forecasts. During the quarter, Tencent faced macroeconomic headwinds stemming from a resurgence of Covid in China and subsequent lockdowns of major cities, including the financial metropolis of Shanghai. Authorities have committed to a ""Zero Covid"" policy which has caused disruptions across the world's second-largest economy.China's economy grew just 0.4% in the second quarter, missing analyst expectations. That had an impact on the company's fintech, cloud and advertising revenue.Meanwhile, China's domestic video games industry has also faced challenges due to stricter regulation. Tencent makes about a third of its total revenue from gaming. Last year, Chinese regulators introduced a rule limiting the amount of time children under 18-years-old could spend playing online games to a maximum of three hours a week and only during specific times.Regulators also froze the approval of new games between July 2021 and April this year. In China, games need to get the green light from regulators before being released and monetized.Analysts at China Renaissance said in a note published last month that Tencent launched just three mobile games in the second quarter. So the company has relied on its existing popular titles to generate revenue. Tencent said second-quarter domestic games revenue fell 1% year-on-year to 31.8 billion yuan, while international games revenue fell the same percentage amount to 10.7 billion yuan.The Chinese technology giant said the international games market ""experienced a post-pandemic digestion period."" During the height of the Covid pandemic and lockdowns globally, people turned to gaming for entertainment and companies like Tencent and rival NetEase saw a big boom. But since countries have re-opened, people are spending less time playing games and the year-on-year comparisons for companies are tough to live up to.Tencent also said the Chinese market was experiencing ""a similar digestion period due to transitional issues including relatively fewer big game releases, lower user spending, and the implementation of Minor protection measures.""The company said it saw decreased revenue in the second quarter from some of its long-established hit games like PUBG Mobile and Honor of Kings.Martin Lau, president at Tencent, said during an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday that the regulatory environment in China is ""progressing from rectification to normalization,"" which should ""bode well for the industry over time."" He said in the gaming sector, regulation is trending in a ""more positive"" direction.Lau added that he expects Tencent to receive game licenses from regulators in the ""near future"" which will help the company's domestic games business over time. The resurgence of Covid in China, lockdowns and subsequent economic slowdown has trickled through to major areas of Tencent's business.Online ad revenue in the second quarter totaled 18.6 billion yuan, down 18% year-on-year.Tencent also runs one of the biggest mobile payments services in China called WeChat Pay via its WeChat messaging app which has over 1 billion users. The company also has a nascent cloud computing business. It wraps revenue from these two under the banner of ""Fintech and Business Services."" Revenue from this segment grew 1% year-on-year to 42.2 billion yuan, a slowing from the quarter before.""FinTech Services revenue growth was slower relative to prior quarters as COVID-19 resurgence temporarily impacted commercial payment activities in April and May,"" Tencent said.Ma Huateng, the CEO of Tencent, said in the company's earnings release that business should pick up as the Chinese economy begins to recover.""We generate approximately half of our revenues from FinTech and Business Services as well as Online Advertising that directly contribute to, and benefit from, overall economic activity, which should position us for revenue growth as China's economy expands,"" Ma said.On the earnings call, Tencent management spoke at length about the company's ""cost control"" strategy to reduce spending in the business. Lau said that Tencent has shuttered some businesses related to areas like online education and ""scaled back"" loss making cloud activities.James Mitchell, chief strategy officer at Tencent, said that with these cost control initiatives, year-on-year earnings growth will return in the ""coming quarters even if our revenue remains as it does now."""
2022-08-17,"Leaders of six Chinese provinces spoke Tuesday at a meeting on the economy headed by Premier Li Keqiang.A day earlier, China reported data for July that missed expectations and showed a slowdown from June.Much of the responsibility for growth in coming months lies with the six ""economically strong provinces"" that account for 45% of national GDP, an English-language meeting readout said. BEIJING — Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has called on six provinces to take the lead in supporting the country's growth after data for July showed a slowdown across the board.Retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment data released Monday missed analysts' expectations and marked a slowdown from June. It comes as China's economy registered growth of just 2.5% in the first half of the year.""Now is the most critical juncture for economic rebound,"" Li said at a meeting Tuesday, according to an English-language readout. He called for ""resolute and prompt efforts"" to strengthen the foundation for recovery.Much of that responsibility lies with six ""economically strong provinces"" that account for 45% of national GDP, the readout said. It said the six provinces also make up nearly 60% of the national total for trade and foreign investment.The leaders of the coastal, export-heavy provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong spoke via video at an economic meeting with Li on Tuesday, the readout said. Leaders of the landlocked provinces of Henan and Sichuan also spoke.The province-level municipalities of Shanghai and Beijing were not mentioned. ""Investment will accelerate in the six provinces as [the] central government will offer [a] green light to major investment projects,"" said Yue Su, principal economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit. She said the provinces might even get assigned their own targets for measures like employment.""Although there's no emphasis on the [national] GDP target, the premier still attaches great importance to the growth rate by mentioning development [as] the key to resolving all problems,"" she said.At the high-level Politburo meeting in late July, China's leaders indicated the country might miss its GDP target of around 5.5% for the year.They also said then that ""provinces with the conditions to achieve the economic targets should strive to,"" according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese. The six provinces that were highlighted at Tuesday's meeting had set GDP targets ranging from 5.5% to 6.5%, for a median goal of 5.75% growth. That's according to CNBC calculations of figures published by state media.In terms of actual growth in the first half of the year, that median was 2.65%, according to CNBC calculations of official data for the six provinces accessed through Wind Information. The provincial GDP growth rates ranged from 1.6% to 3.6% during that time. Tuesday's meeting highlighted the six provinces' importance to fiscal revenue.The four coastal provinces account for more than 60% of all provinces' net contribution to the central budget, the readout said. ""They should complete their tasks in this respect,"" the statement said.""I think the meeting reflects the fact that policymakers are disappointed about the July economic data,"" Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said in an email to CNBC. ""Meanwhile, they are increasingly concerned about the property sector.""""As a result, they would like to give another boost to the economy. The surprise cut by the PBOC this Monday is a part of the boost,"" he said.

What to know about the new investing landscape The central bank unexpectedly cut two interest rates on Monday, leading to expectations the People's Bank of China will cut the main loan prime rate in about a week.China's economy has slowed this year, dragged down by Covid outbreaks and ensuing business restrictions. A worsening slump in the massive real estate sector has also weighed on the economy.On real estate, Li only said that ""the economically strong provinces"" should support needs for basic or improved housing conditions, according to the readout.Instead, Li emphasized the provinces need to boost consumption, especially of big-ticket items such as automobiles, the readout said. The Chinese premier called for more measures to support auto sales in June. Since then, related economic indicators have seen some of the fastest growth.Automobile production climbed by 31.5% year-on-year in July, official data showed. Autos exports surged by 64% in July from a year ago, and helped boost China's better-than-expected export growth last month, customs data showed.The official retail sales report for July said auto sales growth slowed to a 9.7% year-on-year pace, down from 13.9% in June. Automobile sales accounted for 10% of China's retail sales in July, which grew by a disappointing 2.7% last month from a year ago.""The combination of falling auto sales growth and rising auto production growth implies a likely inventory build-up in the auto sector,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report Monday."

Motor vehicle and parts dealers sales also fell sharply, declining 1.6%.Gas prices had eclipsed $5 a gallon in many locations earlier in the summer, but fell through July and most recently were at $3.94 a gallon for regular unleaded, according to AAA.""People appear to have used some of the savings from lower gas prices to spend more on other items, both in nominal and — very likely — real terms,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Auto sales have been severely constrained by the chip shortage, so pent-up demand likely is substantial. July's other losers were department stores and clothing retailers, but all these components are noisy and subject to revisions."" Those pullbacks in gas and auto sales were offset by a 2.7% increase in online sales and a 1.5% gain in miscellaneous stores.Consumers have been fighting to keep up with an inflationary environment that has seen prices overall increase 8.5% from a year ago, close to the highest level in 40 years. Price rises have been especially pernicious in the food and energy category; even with the July slide in energy prices, gas station receipts climbed 39.9% from a year ago.July provided some respite from inflation pressures, and the decline in fuel costs particularly allowed consumers to spend elsewhere.Food sales rose just 0.2%, however, even as the food price index as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics increased 1.1% for the month. Sales at bars and restaurants also struggled, rising just 0.1%.Some retailers also have struggled in the current environment.Target on Wednesday said its earnings tumbled close to 90% from a year ago as it has had to mark down prices on unwanted inventory.The Federal Reserve has been using interest rate increases to hold back inflation.

It said this stance will likely remain a major drag on the property sector. In May, UBS cut its forecast to 3%, the lowest among estimates tracked by CNBC at the time.

2022-08-19,"July's consumer price index report finally showed a sign of potential relief – inflation ticked up less than expected from a year ago, and was flat on the month, meaning that a basket of items and services generally stayed the same price.But some items have fallen, on a monthly and weekly basis, potentially signaling that inflation has passed its peak and may be cooling off.This is welcome news to consumers who have been squeezed by higher prices and are looking for any sign of relief. Some of the top items whose prices have come down include eggs, milk and gasoline.  ""Fuel inflation was really big and that's going to have a pretty meaningful impact on consumers and their spending patterns,"" said John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult. ""I think that's actually a good thing for the economy."" Many of the items that have declined are tied to food and energy, often the most volatile costs that consumers deal with.Grocery store staples have dipped.

The average price for a gallon of milk slipped to $3.16 from $3.24 during the period of Aug. 8-12 from the previous month, and the average price of butter fell to $3.67 from $4.68 in the same timeframe, per USDA data.Chicken breast prices also slipped on a weekly basis during the period of Aug. 8-12, but other parts of the chicken are declining as well – chicken wing prices have been trending down and are now cost less than they did pre-pandemic, according to data from the Department of Agriculture. Outside of food, declines can be seen in consumer goods and services related to energy.This is because oil prices are often subject to big price swings as the balance between supply and demand shifts. This year, the war between Russia and Ukraine threw that balance off and the price of oil spiked when countries stopped buying from Russia, a major exporter.However, oil prices have come back down, lowering the cost of energy and particularly gasoline. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is $3.918 as of Friday, according to AAA. While that's higher than it was a year ago, it's a solid decline from the $4.495 consumers were paying for gas a month ago, and a sharp drop from the recent high of $5.016 hit in June. That also potentially affected another area of the economy that saw a price dip month over month – airfares. The average price of a domestic airline ticket has dropped to $295 in August from $332 in July, according to travel site Hopper. That's also back in-line with the average price for a domestic ticket in the same month in 2019.Outside of fuel costs, this dip in ticket prices could be because consumer demand is fading, according to according to Kevin Gordon, a senior investment research manager at Schwab.""That could be demand destruction,"" he said, adding that the reopening from pandemic lockdowns inflated the price of things as consumers rushed to take vacations again. Now, as vacation season is winding down, that demand has fallen off. Of course, one month of prices falling in some categories isn't a trend.The slowdown in price increases – and dips of costs of some items and services – may mark the beginning of declines, but more months of data would be needed to know for sure.""I think it's way too early to start taking a victory lap,"" said Leer, adding that consumers should expect to be living in a world with elevated inflation for the next year and a half to two years.In addition, it's important to remember that falling prices, or inflation cooling off, may ultimately signal that the U.S. economy is slowing down.  ""You want the price pressures relieved, but what the end goal with that is probably that we're getting closer to a recession,"" said Gordon. As the Federal Reserve continues to increase its benchmark interest rate, it wants the economy to slow down but will try not to tip the U.S. into a recession which would lead to job losses.Further, prices of other common items have remained stubbornly high and are still climbing. The price of most fruit, for instance, continues to stay high and even increase week after week, according to USDA data. Swift changes are normal as well — even though dairy fell through Aug. 12, prices of milk and butter ticked back up through Aug. 19, USDA found.Coffee prices were up 3.5% from June to July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Housing costs such as rent have also remained high and are some of the hardest to pull back down, Gordon noted.Still, seeing the prices of common items trend back down is a good thing for consumers and sentiment.""I think consumers increasingly believe that inflation is going to come down,"" said Leer."
2022-08-19,"Although inflation showed signs of easing in the latest reading, the Consumer Price Index was up 8.5% in July from a year earlier.Compared with millennials and baby boomers, more members of Generation X have cut back on both discretionary spending and essentials, research shows.However, fewer Gen Xers report withdrawing from their retirement account than other generations, according to the study. As Generation X edges closer to retirement, inflation appears to be weighing more heavily on that age group than other adults.Compared with millennials (ages 26 to 41) and baby boomers (ages 58 to 76), a larger share of Gen Xers (ages 42 to 57) are concerned about the nation's economic outlook, maintaining their standard of living, retiring on time and affording retirement expenses, according to recent research from State Street Global Advisors.""Gen X is showing signs of stress with the highest concern about inflation … the country's economic outlook, market volatility, as well as their ability to stay the course,"" said Brie Williams, head of practice management for State Street Global Advisors.  The research was based on an analysis of survey results from 243 adults with investable assets of $250,000 or more. The margin of error is plus or minus 5%.While inflation showed signs of easing in July, the Consumer Price Index was up 8.5% from a year earlier. The Federal Reserve has raised a key interest rate several times this year in an effort to slow inflation, and is expected to implement another hike next month.  The higher-than-normal pace of inflation — the Fed's target rate is 2% — has caused a greater share of Gen Xers (61%) to cut back on discretionary spending like dining out. Among millennials, it's 37% and for boomers, 54%.For essential purchases like groceries or gas, the results are similar: 41% of Gen X have cut back more than millennials (26%) and boomers (21%).They also are more likely to have reduced contributions to their regular savings — 36% versus 18% for both other generations — but not to their retirement accounts. Just 5% of Gen Xers say they have cut back the amount they add to their retirement nest egg, compared with 18% of millennials and 11% of boomers. ""I think the actions that they're demonstrating are relatively prudent so far,"" Williams said.There also may be a benefit down the road to the belt-tightening and adjustments to short-term spending and financial goals, Williams said.The age group ""is trying to lean on their resilience to navigate the way forward,"" she said. ""When you see Gen Xers taking a prudent [approach] … it means sticking to a budget or investment discipline will be easier when the economy improves.""More from Personal Finance:Here are 3 tips for paying down your credit card balances8.2 million people may soon get health insurance rebatesHere's how to save on groceries amid high food inflation"
2022-08-22,"Xiaolang Zhang, a former Apple employee who was accused of stealing computer files with trade secrets about Apple's secretive car division, pleaded guilty in federal court in San Jose on Monday.Zhang was arrested by federal agents in July 2018 at the San Jose airport where he planned to fly to China. Xiaolang Zhang, a former Apple employee who was accused of stealing computer files with trade secrets about Apple's secretive car division, pleaded guilty in federal court in San Jose on Monday.Zhang's plea agreement with the U.S. government is under seal, according to court filings on Monday. Zhang faces as much as 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to a felony charge of theft of trade secrets. Sentencing is scheduled for November.Zhang was accused of downloading internal Apple files about the company's car project — specifically, a 25-page document including engineering schematics of a circuit board for an autonomous vehicle. Zhang was also accused of taking reference manuals and PDFs describing Apple's prototypes and prototype requirements.Zhang was arrested by federal agents in July 2018 at the San Jose airport, where he planned to fly to China. He had previously worked for Apple since 2015, most recently as a hardware engineer on Apple's autonomous vehicle team, according to charging documents from the FBI and U.S. attorney's office.The charges gave a peek into a secretive side of Apple that the company even years later still doesn't often acknowledge: its division developing autonomous electric vehicles.In the 2018 charging documents, an FBI agent said that that company had about 5,000 ""disclosed"" employees, which means that they knew about the project, and 2,700 ""core employees"" with access to project materials and databases.Apple uses internal software to track which employees are disclosed on which projects, and are required to attend in-person secrecy training, according to the complaint. Zhang worked on the autonomous car project's Compute Team, which designed and tested circuit boards for sensors.Schematics for circuit designs are considered among the most valuable trade secrets in the electronics industry.Apple first suspected Zhang of stealing trade secrets after he took paternity leave and traveled to China. When he came back to the company, he turned in his resignation, saying that he wanted to move back to China and take care of his mother, according to the 2018 complaint.He told Apple that he planned to work for Xmotors, a leading Chinese electric vehicle company, and his access to Apple's network was cut.An Apple investigation found that Zhang downloaded documents and information from company databases, according to the complaint. Apple closed-circuit cameras even captured Zhang entering the labs and removing hardware, which later was identified as circuit boards and a Linux server, the complaint said.Another former Apple employee, Jizhong Chen, is also facing charges related to allegedly stealing trade secrets from Apple's electric car division in early 2019. In that case, Chen, a U.S. citizen, also planned to travel to China. Chen has not pleaded guilty and is represented by the same lawyer as Zhang. A trial date has not been set. A lawyer for Zhang didn't respond to a request for comment. Apple representatives didn't respond to requests for comment."

Here's what the pros have to sayJoshua Natoli17 hours agoIt comes after Alibaba and Tencent posted a set of second-quarter results that confirmed these once free-wheeling and high-flying behemoths are not growing anymore.China's biggest e-commerce player Alibaba reported flat growth for the first time ever for its April to June quarter. On Wednesday, gaming and social media giant Tencent posted its first-ever quarterly year-on-year revenue decline.Alibaba and Tencent have felt the effects of a Covid-induced economic slowdown in China that is hitting everything from consumer spending to advertising budgets. The tightening of domestic technology regulation in areas from antitrust to gaming over the last year and a half is also weighing on results.As revenue remains under pressure, both giants have looked to be more disciplined in their approach to spending.""During the second quarter, we actively exited non-core businesses, tightened our marketing spending, and trimmed operating expenses,"" Tencent CEO Ma Huateng, told analysts during a call Wednesday. ""This enabled us to sequentially increase our earnings despite difficult revenue conditions."" Indeed, Tencent's profit, when excluding certain non-cash items and impact of merger and acquisition transactions, rose 10% from the previous quarter.Tencent President Martin Lau said the company exited non-core businesses such as online education, e-commerce, and game live streaming. The company also tightened marketing spend and cut down low areas of investment such as user acquisition. Tencent's selling and marketing expenses fell 21% year-on-year in the second quarter.The Shenzhen-headquartered company's headcount was also down by 5,000 versus the first quarter.James Mitchell, chief strategy officer at Tencent, said that with these initiatives plus investments in new areas, the company can ""return the business to year-on-year earnings growth, even if the macro environment remains as it is today"" and even if revenue growth remains flat.Alibaba meanwhile flagged its cost cutting drive earlier this year and continues to push forward with it.""In the coming quarters and the remainder of this fiscal year, we will continue to pursue the strategy of cost optimization and cost control,"" Toby Xu, chief financial officer at Alibaba, said during the company's earnings call this month.Xu said the Chinese e-commerce giant has ""narrowed losses"" in some of its strategic businesses. Alibaba and Tencent have had to play a delicate balancing act to convince investors that while costs are being cut, they're still investing in the future.""For them to go back to [the] earnings growth path, cost optimization only is not enough. They need to find new growth drivers,"" Winston Ma, adjunct professor of law at New York University, told CNBC via email. Alibaba has been focusing on boosting its cloud computing business, an area executives and investors believe is key to better profitability at the company in the future. Cloud was Alibaba's fastest-growing area by revenue in the June quarter.Meanwhile, Tencent talked up the potential for ads in its WeChat short-video feature to become a ""substantial"" revenue source in the future. Tencent runs WeChat, China's largest messaging app with over one billion users.Alibaba will continue to focus on areas with ""long-term potential"" such as cloud computing and overseas e-commerce, Chelsey Tam, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC. ""For the unprofitable businesses it will evaluate the cost and benefits.""Ivan Su, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said that Tencent has ""done a really good job balancing long-term investments and near-term profitability.""""If you look at the cost initiatives they announced, some of the reductions are permanent, such as cloud migration and shutdowns of unprofitable noncore businesses, while others (marketing budget pullback and hiring slowdown) are more temporary in nature. So there're multiple levers they can pull to create such balance,"" Su said."
2022-08-22,"Best Buy, Ford Motor, HBO Max, Peloton, Shopify, Re/Max, Walmart and Wayfair are among the firms that have announced layoffs in recent weeks.50% of firms anticipate a reduction in overall headcount in the next six to 12 months, according to a PwC survey.There are some steps workers worried about job cuts can do to prepare, according to employment and financial experts. Many companies have announced layoffs in recent weeks, and others have hinted that cuts may be coming. Luckily, there are steps workers can take to prepare.""At the end of day, you can't control what's happening in the economy, but you can control building a strong professional resilience,"" according to Mandi Woodruff-Santos, a career and money coach.Best Buy, Ford Motor, HBO Max, Peloton, Shopify, Re/Max, Walmart and Wayfair are among the firms that announced layoffs in recent weeks.Meanwhile, 50% of firms are anticipating a reduction in overall headcount, while 52% foresee instituting a hiring freeze and 44% rescinding job offers, according to a PwC survey of 722 U.S. executives fielded in early August.These are executives' expectations for the next six months to a year, and therefore may evolve, according to Bhushan Sethi, co-head of PwC's global people and organization group. ""They're focusing on what they can control,"" Sethi said of employers. ""They're dealing with geopolitics, supply-chain issues, inflation, war in Ukraine, all these factors for which they have to determine what their strategies are.""Despite those negative indicators, other data suggest the labor market remains strong.Employers added 528,000 payrolls in July, beating expectations and marking a full recovery of lost jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic. The layoff rate hovered near record lows in June while job openings remained historically elevated.About 250,000 people filed an initial claim for unemployment benefits during the week ended Aug. 13 — an increase relative to the spring but only up slightly from prepandemic levels.""The labor markets are still incredibly strong, from all the data we've seen,"" Sethi said.Here are some tips to prepare for a potential layoff. Workers should first take stock of their specific situation, rather than extrapolate based on negative headlines. Your industry may be well-insulated from layoffs, at least for the time being, which means worry might be misplaced, experts said.Woodruff-Santos recommends thinking instead about your ""personal professional economy,"" including your job and skills. For example, what do employment and job openings look like in your industry? What are you seeing and hearing from the people in your industry?  More from Personal Finance:Three key things to know about enrolling in MedicareConsumer watchdog signals 'a closer look' at record-high credit card ratesAmericans have $21 billion in unused gift cards, store credits""People should forget about what's happening in Silicon Valley if they don't work in that space,"" she said. ""If you're a project manager in the education or health care space, that's an entirely different ballgame.""It remains a worker's market in many areas of the economy, especially for specialized talent in fields such as cybersecurity and digital, automation, supply chains, and mergers and acquisitions, for example, Sethi said. It's always prudent to have an emergency fund, but that financial buffer will be especially important after a layoff.That money will help bridge an income gap during periods of unemployment. Many workers don't get severance pay or may only receive a few weeks of income. Workers won't necessarily qualify for unemployment benefits, depending on their state, employment and recent earnings history.""A lot of people today don't have three months of a cash reserve,"" according to Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner and CEO of oXYGen Financial, based in Atlanta. ""If you get fired it's not necessarily true you'll get a severance package.""Workers should also examine their expenses, which will determine how long their emergency fund lasts, he added. They should include student loans in these calculations — payments are scheduled to resume after Aug. 31, though the deadline may be extended, Jenkin said.Further, it's a good time for workers to schedule any necessary health appointments while on their existing insurance plan, especially as many people may have met their deductible for the year, Jenkin said.Those with a 401(k) plan loan might also consider trying to expedite repayment. Laid-off individuals may incur tax penalties for failing to repay that loan within a certain time frame (typically 90 days) after losing a job. Workers can also focus on boosting their ""professional resiliency"" ahead of a potential layoff, Woodruff-Santos said.Many people focus on dusting off a resume during times of career transition; but that's not necessarily the key to finding another job, especially for those in more advanced stages of their careers, she said. Personal branding and personal relationships become more essential. Individuals can attend or participate in panels at industry conferences, attend workshops, and post or share industry-related content on social media sites like LinkedIn — all in service of engaging with their career network, Woodruff-Santos said.Workers who complete a team project can consider doing a ""shoutout"" on social media touting the work and tagging the team members involved, for example, she added.Excelling in the workplace and being a good colleague can help in the long term, especially if former colleagues remember your work and can help recruit you to another firm.""You can't underestimate the value of those connections you're making in your current workplace,"" Woodruff-Santos said."
2022-08-23,"Sales of existing homes were down last month by 20.2% to 4.8 million properties from 6 million a year earlier. However, the median price last month was $403,800, up 10.8% from July 2021, and homes are still selling quickly.There are implications for buyers and sellers, who may already be seeing shifts in their local market. Just months ago, the housing market remained in overdrive: surging home prices, historically low interest rates and unrelenting demand. However, data now suggests to some experts that the market is in a ""housing recession.""For example, sales of existing homes in July fell by 5.9% from June, marking the sixth straight month of a decline — and a drop of more than 20% from a year earlier. What's more, there have been layoffs and slower job growth in the industry, homebuilder sentiment has turned negative and buyers are canceling contracts in the face of interest rates that have jumped to 5.72% from below 3.3% heading into 2022.""We're witnessing a housing recession in terms of declining home sales and home building,"" Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said in a recent report.At this point, however, it's a different story for homeowners, buyers and sellers.""It's not a recession in home prices,"" Yun added. ""Inventory remains tight and prices continue to rise nationally with nearly 40% of homes still commanding the full list price.""But there are signs the market is starting to shift in buyers' favor.More from Personal Finance:Here are 3 tips for paying down your credit card balances8.2 million people may soon get health insurance rebatesHere's how to save on groceries amid high food inflation ""Prices are still rising in nearly all markets across the country … and inventory is improving slightly, but not greatly so,"" Yun told CNBC.""Homeowners are in a very comfortable position financially, in terms of their housing wealth,"" Yun said. He also recently said homeowners are ""absolutely not"" in a recession.Sales of existing homes were down in July by 20.2% to 4.8 million properties from 6 million a year earlier, according to NAR. However, the median price last month was $403,800, up 10.8% from July 2021. With interest rates roughly double where they were six months ago, buyers have had more trouble qualifying for loans or affording higher rates. ""I am seeing homebuyers cancel a contract if their payment is just a little bit higher than what they expected — I'm talking about $100,"" said Al Bingham, a mortgage loan officer at Momentum Loans in Sandy, Utah. ""Homebuyers are very cautious right now."" For buyers, the slowdown in demand is generally good news, experts say.""Buyers should expect a little better price negotiation possibility,"" Yun said. ""Last year, they were at the mercy of whatever sellers were asking … and there were multiple offers. Buyers may not face that now."" While it depends on the specific market, there's more of a chance that buyers will see more normal buying experiences. In some places, the slowdown means less competition and more likelihood that sellers will accept offers that come with contingencies — such as the buyer must sell their own home first.""We're seeing contingencies be accepted and that wasn't happening,"" said Stephen Rinaldi, president and founder of Rinaldi Group, a mortgage broker based near Philadelphia. ""We'll probably see a more balanced market."" Sellers, meanwhile, may want to temper their expectations.""Sellers need to be realistic about the changing market,"" Yun said. ""They cannot expect to simply list their home at a high price and easily find a buyer.""Too many buyers chasing after too few properties — those days are over,"" he said.At the same time, homes are still selling quickly. In July, properties typically remained on the market for 14 days, down from 17 days a a year earlier, according to the Realtors association."

2022-08-23,"  Goldman Sachs expects household cash flow to reverse a year-long decline beginning right after Christmas.Gains will begin small and accelerate through the next year, making up for the recent decline in cash from federal stimulus payments, and that could help avert the recession that both the stock market and most small businesses have been fearing.In the retail sector, big box stores and internet giants like Amazon will likely gain, while smaller rivals could get squeezed. After a year-long dip, household cash flow will begin growing again right after Christmas, and accelerate through the new year, according to new research by analysts at Goldman Sachs.These gains will reverse a year of negative growth of about $600, or 4.2%, in household discretionary cash flow, according to Goldman's analysis.""This year, we're looking at negative discretionary cash flow for the first time since the 2008-09 financial crisis,"" Goldman consumer goods analyst Jason English said on a recent webinar with the press. The biggest driver of the cash flow improvement next year, he said, will be wages.That's good news for retail sales after a yearlong struggle to keep up with inflation, and for the economy's ability to avoid a recession, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which has a similar forecast of improving consumer finances.""Cash flow got hit during 2022 but it's coming back, and cash flow is what drives spending,"" Zandi said. ""Businesses are unlikely to cut jobs because they know their biggest problem is finding workers,"" Zandi added.   While much has been made of the consumer resilience during a period of slowing economic growth, the market has punished retail companies, which have declined roughly twice as much as the broader U.S. stock market index this year, measured by the relative performance of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF and S&P 500 Index. This year's sloppy performance in consumer spending is happening because households have less cash coming in — even though they have more savings — since stimulus payments designed to fight the Covid pandemic ended in 2021.Retail sales in the U.S. have risen about 10% in the last year, but most of that reflects the surging dollar value of gasoline and other goods sold at this year's inflated prices, according to recent Commerce Department data. Auto sales have risen just 1.5 percent, far below the pace of inflation. That has helped the pace of inflation-adjusted consumer spending growth slow to about 1.5 percent in the first half of 2022, compared with nearly 12 percent a year earlier. The surge in capital goods spending during the brief Covid recession, as consumers snapped up furniture and other home-related goods when they spent more time at home due to the pandemic, contributed to retail's slump this year because it pulled demand forward, English said.But the turn is coming, according to Goldman.The drop in consumer cash flow began as a steep one, but the spread between 2021 and 2022 has been steadily narrowing. In the first quarter, consumers had 10% less discretionary cash available than in the same month a year earlier, which Goldman says will narrow to a 2.7 percent dip this quarter and a 1.2 percent drop for the holiday season.The cash flow measure Goldman uses adds other sources of cash, like government transfer payments and borrowing, to current income, and subtracts essential expenses like food and fuel, giving a fuller picture of consumers' likely ability and willingness to spend. Next year, the numbers get more positive through the year, Goldman's estimates show. Consumer cash flow will rise by 2 percent in the first quarter, and rise to 6 percent-plus in the second half of 2023, an overall gain of about $600 billion. While the upswing in consumer income is good news for the economy, it may not benefit all firms equally, according to CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram, who expects the gain in consumer income will help big retailers the most. Large-scale players like Amazon and Walmart, and to a lesser degree Target, will be winners and take market share, he said.The sluggish retail conditions of this year may keep smaller consumer companies from gaining access to capital markets that have gotten more selective even as conditions improve. ""They should have raised money a year ago,"" Sundaram said. ""Now markets are tighter ... They're trying to cut expenses and reduce their cash burn."" While Sundaram was focusing on consumer startups that went public in recent years, such as Oatly and Beyond Meat, the mood among America's broader small business community is not optimistic, with inflation continuing to hurt Main Street's ability to maintain margins at a time of higher prices in inputs, from raw materials to energy, transportation and labor. Most small business owners believe a recession is inevitable; in fact, some think the recession has already begun and have reduced their sales outlook into the next year, according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey for Q3 2022, which saw small business confidence hit an all-time low. Meanwhile, the world's largest retailer Walmart — which had lowered second-quarter profit targets but then reported a beat on August 16, devoted much of its second-quarter earnings call to explaining its investment plans — which chief financial officer John David Rainey said will be one source of the chain's hopes to boost profitability in the year ahead. Walmart has boosted capital spending 50% to $7.5 billion in the first half of its fiscal year, which ends in January. Rival Target, which experienced a 90 percent drop in second quarter earnings, nearly doubled investment, to $2.52 billion from $1.34 billion. Walmart CFO John Rainey cited the buildout of automation and technology throughout its business, and how it will continue to help drive greater efficiency, in a call with analysts after its earnings. He pointed to the company's augmented-reality Viz Pick technology, which uses workers' cell phones to speed up restocking of shelves to avoid lost sales.Before the coming pop in customer income, retailers still have to get through the back to school and holiday shopping seasons, when household income will still be a little lower than it was in 2021 and retailers will still be dealing with excess inventory of home-related goods that they have been marking down and writing off.""If we're cleared by the holidays, we're in much better shape going forward than the market is currently estimating,"" English said.  "

President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he will forgive $10,000 in federal student debt for most borrowers, fulfilling a campaign pledge and delivering financial relief to millions of Americans.Biden will cancel up to $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants.""Both of these targeted actions are for families who need it the most,"" the president said in remarks from the White House on Wednesday afternoon.The relief will be limited to Americans earning under $125,000 per year, or $250,000 for married couples or heads of households. The relief is also capped at the amount of a borrower's outstanding eligible debt, per the Education Department.The president will also extend the payment pause on most federal student loans ""one final time"" through Dec. 31, 2022, according to the tweet.In his remarks, Biden said that 95% of borrowers would benefit from the plan, or about 43 million people. Of those, over 60% are Pell Grant recipients.In all, nearly 45% of borrowers, or almost 20 million people, would have their debt fully canceled, Biden said.""That's 20 million people who can start getting on with their lives,"" Biden said.""All of this means people can start finally to crawl out from under that mountain of debt. To get on top of their rent and their utilities. To finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business.""Biden's decision to move ahead with $10,000 in student debt cancellation for borrowers who earn under $125,000 will cost the federal government around $244 billion, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. The $20,000 in relief for Pell Grant recipients may add around $120 billion to the government's costs.The unprecedented action by the White House of wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer debt follows years of advocacy pressure and recent months of heated debate among Biden administration officials.Those discussions centered on how student loan forgiveness might impact the high inflation hitting Americans' wallets, the amount of student debt that should be canceled and if the president even had the power to reduce people's balances without the legislative branch. More from Personal Finance:What to know about Biden's forgiveness plan: How it works, when to applyTimeline: Key events on the path to student loan forgivenessStudent loan payment pause extended through December.

Advocates have said that forgiving student debt will galvanize younger voters, among whom Biden has been losing popularity, to the polls.Although the president had been pushed to cancel $50,000 or more per person, including by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and groups such as the NAACP, he had repeatedly expressed reluctance to wipe out that much debt for all borrowers.  When the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. in March 2020 and crippled the economy, the Trump administration put federal student loan payments on pause. That pause has since been extended six times, and Biden's White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, said earlier this year that the president would make his decision on student loan forgiveness before payments resume in September. ""The student loan crisis"" has become a familiar term in the mouths of politicians and in households across the U.S.More than 40 million Americans are in debt for their education, owing a cumulative $1.7 trillion, a balance that far exceeds outstanding credit card or auto debt. Skyrocketing higher education costs coupled with stagnant wages have caused the amount of student debt people graduate with to soar. Today the average balance is over $30,000, up from $12,000 in 1980.  Before the pandemic, when the U.S. economy was enjoying one of its healthiest periods in history, problems plagued the federal student loan system.Only about half of borrowers were in repayment in 2019, according to an estimate by Kantrowitz. A quarter — or more than 10 million people — were in delinquency or default, and the rest had applied for temporary relief for struggling borrowers, including deferments or forbearances.These grim figures led to comparisons to the 2008 mortgage crisis. ""The student loan system is broken,"" said Persis Yu, policy director for the Student Borrower Protection Center. Democrats and Republicans have pointed to major flaws in the federal student loan system. Problems come into play as soon as students take out loans, experts say, and more crop up in repayment. Among them:Hundreds of thousands of students have been provided federal loans at colleges they say turned out to be predatory and deceptive, leaving them with high debt and poor job prospects.The lenders that contract with the U.S. government have been accused of misleading borrowers and steering them into unnecessarily expensive and long forbearances. One of the most popular federal programs, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, has not yet led to the debt forgiveness that over a million borrowers were relying on because of confusing rules and lenders failing to keep track of their payments.Extraordinary collection powers by the federal government means that hundreds of thousands of veterans and older Americans who have fallen behind on their student loans have had portions of their benefits regularly garnished.  Research shows that student debt holds individuals back from starting businesses, saving for their retirement and buying homes. As a result, debt forgiveness is likely to change the life trajectory for tens of millions of Americans.  Calls for broad student loan forgiveness date back to the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, shortly before outstanding education debt surpassed $1 trillion.At the time, advocates began to question why corporations should get a bailout from the government on their debt but not everyday Americans who had sought an education. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., rolled out a plan to forgive $50,000 for almost all borrowers on her first day in office as president. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., went further, promising to cancel all of the debt if he made it to the White House.On the campaign trail, Biden took a more conservative approach than his rivals to the left, coming out in support of $10,000 in student loan forgiveness. In office, however, the president has been under relentless pressure from Democrats and advocates to deliver deeper relief. Wisdom Cole, national director of the NAACP's youth and college division, had said that nixing just $10,000 would be ""a slap in the face"" for Black borrowers, who often have to borrow more than their white peers because of the racial wealth gap.  The announcement is sure to aggravate many Americans, including those who never borrowed for their education or went to college. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently called student loan forgiveness ""a giveaway to highly educated college grads."" Some Republicans have said they will try to block an effort by the president to cancel the debt.Critics of student loan forgiveness have questioned the fairness of directing relief at those who have benefited from a college education, which usually leads to higher wages.""Economists generally agree that widespread loan cancellation is regressive, delivering the biggest bailout to those who need it the least,"" said Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the center-right American Enterprise Institute.Forgiveness will only worsen the lending crisis, Akers added. ""The president is sending the wrong message to future borrowers who will likely expect their own bailout in the future,"" she said. ""Americans may borrow and pay more for college as a result.""Yet advocates have said that framing student loan forgiveness as a handout to the well-off is a misinterpretation of the deep and historic inequities of the American economy.Mushrooming tuition prices coupled with stagnant household wages over the last 40 years, they argue, have forced more and more families to borrow to attend college, an increasingly necessary step to reach the middle class.  ""All of these fat cats and people who never want to see help for working people and poor people come up with these myths,"" Schumer said in June, in one of his many pushes for $50,000 in student debt cancellation.""This is not a problem that concerns the wealthy,"" Schumer said."

The Inflation Reduction Act, the most aggressive climate investment ever taken by Congress, could cut the social costs of climate change by up to $1.9 trillion by 2050, the White House said in an assessment on Tuesday.The act, which the president signed into law earlier this month, will reduce costs related to rising temperatures, minimize property damage from sea level rise and other disasters and reduce health impacts such as premature death, the White House said.The analysis by the Office of Management and Budget, which administers the federal budget, is the first published estimate of avoided climate-related social costs resulting from legislation. The social cost of carbon is an estimate of the economic costs that would occur from a future level of carbon pollution.The bill's climate provisions are projected to reduce the country's carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030.

2022-08-25,"Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler said the U.S. economy was showing more signs of strength than weakness.The author of ""Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness"" also said those declaring inflation permanent might be speaking too soon.Thaler is known for his work on behavioral economics. Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler says the U.S. may have recorded two successive quarters of economic contraction, but it's ""just funny"" to describe it as being a recession. ""I don't see anything that resembles a recession. We have record low unemployment, record high vacancies. That looks like a strong economy,"" Thaler told CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum on Wednesday.""The economy is growing, it's just growing slightly less fast than prices. And that means real GDP fell a little bit, but I think it's just funny to call that a recession,"" he said. ""It's not like any recession we've seen in my rather long lifetime.""U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, fell by 0.9% year-on-year in the second quarter, following a 1.6% decline in the first quarter. Two consecutive falls in GDP growth meet the traditional definition of a recession. Officially, the National Bureau of Economic Research declares recessions and expansions, and likely won't make a judgment on the period in question for months.Thaler, the 2017 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, is best known for his work in behavioral economics — and for explaining the so-called ""hot hand"" fallacy alongside singer Selena Gomez in the 2015 film ""The Big Short."" His work looks at how people make decisions that are seemingly irrational according to economic theory, and his co-written book, ""Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness,"" describes how this can be used to create better public policy solutions and ""nudge"" human behavior.  Asked about U.S. inflation, which rose 8.5% year-on-year in July, Thaler said, ""There was this long debate about whether inflation was transitory or not, and team permanent seems to be winning, though I think they may be declaring victory a little too quickly.""Inflation is the rate of change in prices as opposed to high prices, he noted.""At least some of the high prices we're observing are caused directly either by the war in Ukraine or by supply chain problems from China. And we hope that both of those factors are temporary,"" he said. ""Maybe a year from now there will still be fighting in Ukraine and there will still be Covid in China, but we hope that that's not the case, and if one or both of those problems is mitigated then I could see some prices going down.""Thaler also addressed U.S. wages, which have stagnated against productivity since the 1970s but recorded sharp rises in the two most recent quarters amid a tight labor market, reportedly spooking the Federal Reserve over the potential for a wage-price spiral.""If I was the head of a union, I would certainly be asking for a big raise next year to compensate my workers for the higher prices they're facing,"" Thaler said.

2022-08-25,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks Friday at 10 a.m. ET in a much-anticipated appearance at the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium.Fed watchers do not expect a new message from the Fed chairman, just a tougher version of the central bank's promise to slow inflation by raising interest rates.Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed is unlikely to quickly reverse course after it reaches an end rate, as the futures market has been expecting. Investors are looking for new guidance in Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole, Wyoming, speech Friday, but he could instead deliver the same inflation fighting message, just with a much tougher edge.Powell is expected to emphasize that the central bank will use all the fire power it needs in the form of interest rate hikes to snuff out inflation. He is also likely to point out that after the Fed finishes raising rates, it will probably hold them there, contrary to market expectations that it will actually start to cut interest rates next year.Fed watchers say Powell is also unlikely to provide any substantive clues to resolve the market debate about whether the central bank will raise rates by a half point or three-quarters of a point at its next policy meeting on Sept. 21. Instead, Powell will likely reiterate that the Fed is highly dependent on incoming economic data. Before the Fed meets in September, there is another major employment report next Friday and the August consumer price index on Sept. 13. The futures market has been betting that a three-quarter point hike — or 0.75 of a percent — is more likely at the September meeting. The central bank raised rates by 0.75 of a point in both June and July. The fed funds rate is now in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, and the Fed is targeting an end rate, or terminal rate, of 3.50% to 3.75% by the first quarter of next year.""The challenge for Powell is going to be the tone he adopts. I think he came across as slightly too dovish, not hawkish enough in July,"" said David Page, head of macroeconomic research at AXA Investment Managers. ""I think he wants to avoid that now, with markets expecting him to be relatively hawkish. ... It's a very difficult game. It's a game of expectations. ... It becomes a fine tune issue.""Stocks rallied after Powell's comments following the July meeting and bond yields fell, signaling that markets perceived the chairman to be more dovish, or easy when it comes to interest rate expectations. But in the last week, bond yields have risen on a chorus of hawkish comments from other Fed officials.Page said Powell is trying to avoid another big stock market rally and lower rates, which mean that financial conditions are loosening. The Fed is trying the difficult maneuver of cooling inflation by tightening financial conditions as it slows the economy and job market without causing a recession.

Powell was still characterizing inflation as ""transitory"" and Fed expectations for rate hikes were much lower.""It was a lower for longer policy stance,"" said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America. ""Compared to that, this is going to sound super hawkish."" But the environment has changed dramatically since then, too, as inflation showed itself to be persistent rather than passing. Consumer inflation topped out at 9.1% in June, and it may have just peaked — months after the Fed had first expected.""I think that will be the message - we're going to slow down at some point. We're tightening, but don't expect a quick shift to cuts,"" said Gapen.Powell said after the July Fed meeting that the central bank could downsize the rate cuts at some point, but he did not mention reversing them, Gapen said.""As monetary policy was premised lower for longer and needing a hot labor market, this is higher for longer and not needing a hot labor market in order to achieve price stability,"" said Gapen.Fed watchers say Powell may have confused market expectations when he said after July's Fed meeting that the central bank was close to the neutral rate. The neutral rate is the level where the Fed does not have to raise or lower rates, and it had long been considered by central bank Fed officials to be 2.5%."

This is important because the market has behaved recently as if the Fed has pivoted away from its hawkish stance,"" Bartholomew said in an email Wednesday.""It is hard to believe the Fed leadership is comfortable with how financial conditions have become much more accommodative after the last month, and so Powell will use this speech as an opportunity to push back against this more dovish interpretation of Fed policy that has arisen recently.""U.S. stocks were higher in late-morning trade Thursday, after Wall Street snapped a three-day losing streak on Wednesday.Investors stateside will also be closely watching Thursday's weekly jobless claims data and Friday's PCE (personal consumption expenditure) reading, one of the Fed's favored inflation measures.Shares in Asia-Pacific mostly ticked higher on Thursday, while Hong Kong's morning session was canceled due to a typhoon warning.On the data front in Europe, Germany's Ifo Institute business climate and expectations surveys and final second-quarter GDP figures from Europe's largest economy were published Thursday.

2022-08-26,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday pledged that the central bank will ""use our tools forcefully"" to attack inflation that is still running near its highest level in more than 40 years.In his annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, policy speech, Powell added that higher interest rates likely will persist ""for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.""The remarks come amid signs that inflation may have peaked but is not showing any marked signs of decline. Powell said the Fed will not be swayed by a month or two of data. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a stern commitment Friday to halting inflation, warning that he expects the central bank to continue raising interest rates in a way that will cause ""some pain"" to the U.S. economy.In his much-anticipated annual policy speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell affirmed that the Fed will ""use our tools forcefully"" to attack inflation that is still running near its highest level in more than 40 years.Even with a series of four consecutive interest rate increases totaling 2.25 percentage points, Powell said this is ""no place to stop or pause"" even though benchmark rates are probably around an area considered neither stimulative nor restrictive to growth.""While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.""Stocks fell after the Powell speech, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 500 points.  Treasury yields were off their highs of the session.The remarks come amid signs that inflation may have peaked but is not showing any marked signs of decline.Two closely watched gauges, the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed prices little changed in July, owing largely to a steep drop in energy costs.At the same time, other areas of the economy are slowing. Housing in particular is falling off rapidly, and economists expect that the huge surge in hiring over the past year and a half is likely to cool.However, Powell cautioned that the Fed's focus is broader than a month or two of data, and it will continue pushing ahead until inflation moves down closer to its 2% long-range goal.""We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%,"" he said. Looking into the future, the central bank leader added that ""restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.""The economy is coming off consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, a commonly held definition of a recession. However, Powell and most other economists see the underlying economy as strong if slowing.""In essence, Powell is clearly stating that right now, fighting inflation is more important than supporting growth,"" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. The speech was unusually brief.Whereas Fed leaders, including Powell, often have used the Jackson Hole symposium as an opportunity to outline broad policy shifts, Powell's remarks Friday clocked in at just about eight minutes.He introduced the speech by noting that his ""remarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my message more direct.""""Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy,"" Powell said. ""Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.""Markets are awaiting the Fed's next meeting in September to see if the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will enact a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase. Powell said the decision ""will depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook. At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.""Traders are currently pricing a close call between a half-point and three-quarter point increase. As of Friday morning after Powell's speech, the probability for a 0.75 point move was at 54.5%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure. The Fed is using a lesson from the past as its guidepost for current policy.Specifically, Powell said the inflation of 40 years ago provides the current Fed with three lessons: That central banks like the Fed are responsible for managing inflation, that expectations are critical and that ""we must keep at it until the job is done.""Powell noted that the Fed's failure to act forcefully in the 1970s caused a perpetuation of high inflation expectations that led to the draconian rate hikes of the early 1980s. In that case, then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker pulled the economy into recession to tame inflation.While stating repeatedly that he doesn't think recession is an inevitable outcome for the U.S. economy, Powell noted that managing expectations is critical if the Fed is going to avoid a Volcker-like outcome.In the early 1980s, ""a lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year,"" Powell said. ""Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.""One concept molding Powell's thinking is ""rational inattention."" Essentially, that means people pay less attention to inflation when it is low and more when it is high.""Of course, inflation has just about everyone's attention right now, which highlights a particular risk today: The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched,"" he said."
2022-08-26,"America's ongoing labor shortage begs an important question: Where have all the workers gone?There are 10.7 million unfilled jobs in the U.S., according to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some economists point to the high numbers of workers quitting amid the Great Resignation. New research highlights another troubling factor that may bear part of the blame: long Covid. A Brookings Institution report published Wednesday says an estimated 16 million Americans between ages 18 to 65 are experiencing Covid symptoms long after infection. The condition, dubbed long Covid, can include brain fog, fatigue, breathing problems, muscle pain, headache, chest pain and even anxiety or depression — all symptoms that can make it challenging for people to work.The report estimates that 2 million to 4 million of those people are currently out of work due to long Covid. That's almost as high as the number of Americans who quit their jobs each month amid the Great Resignation: About 4.2 million quit their jobs in June and nearly 4.3 million quit in May and April, respectively, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In other words, the jobs lost to long Covid could make up about a third of the country's current labor shortage. And the Brookings report says it's costing the U.S. economy in a significant way. Based on the average U.S. wage of $1,106 per week, the report estimates that 3 million people out of work due to condition translates to $168 billion a year in lost earnings. If 4 million long Covid patients are out of work, the lost earnings could be as high as $230 billion, the report says.That's nearly 1% of the country's current-dollar gross domestic product (GDP) of $24.88 trillion.Those high numbers might not even account for the ""full economic burden"" of long Covid, the report says. That's because they don't account for lower productivity among the many long Covid patients who are working while sick, or the health care costs and lost productivity of their caretakers. As long as Covid circulates in the U.S., the number of people with long Covid symptoms will continue to grow: About one in four Covid patients experience long-term symptoms weeks or months after getting infected, according to multiple studies published last year.The Brookings report notes that if the country's long Covid population grows by just 10% each year, the annual cost of lost wages will amount to half a trillion dollars in 10 years: ""If long Covid patients don't begin recovering at greater rates, the economic burden will continue to rise."" As a medical condition, doctors and scientists are still trying to untangle many puzzles related to long Covid. One thing is clear: Anyone can get it.In March 2021, a University of California at Davis Health analysis of multiple long Covid studies found that even patients with mild conditions can experience long Covid. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most likely patients to develop symptoms are those with initial infections severe enough to require hospitalization, the analysis said.A May study from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found that both unvaccinated and vaccinated people are at risk of long Covid. The risk is higher for the unvaccinated, but the study suggested that vaccines only reduce the risk of long Covid by 15%. The condition can undeniably impact a patient's life, work and health. Last year, the Americans with Disabilities Act labeled long Covid a disability because of how it can limit the major life activities of patients.A July 2021 study from the Patient-Led Research Collaborative measured the condition's effect on patients' work over the course of seven months. Only about 27% of long Covid patients worked as many hours as they did before failing ill. Roughly 23% weren't working at all, as a direct result of long Covid. That included being on sick leave, disability leave, quitting, being fired or being unable to find a job that would accommodate them.Ongoing and future research could help determine how to treat the condition, which could get many of those workers back into the workforce.

A key measure of inflation closely watched by U.S. policymakers showed that price increases slowed in July, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday.The personal consumption expenditures price index came in with a year-over-year rise of 6.3% in July, down from 6.8% in June. The index actually fell 0.1% month over month.The core PCE index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, showed a 4.6% rise year over year and a gain of 0.1% month over month in July, coming in softer than forecasts on both counts. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting 4.8% for the core year-over-year reading and 0.2% for the month-over-month change.In June, the core readings showed a rise of 4.8% year over year and 0.6% month over month.The PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. Fed officials are speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, this week, as investors look for clues about the next steps the central bank's rate-hiking cycle. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was committed to fighting inflation and wouldn't declare victory after a short slowdown. ""While the lower inflation readings for July are welcome, a single month's improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down,"" Powell said.Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC's Steve Liesman that Friday's report would make him lean slightly toward a half-point rate hike in September, a slowdown from the three-quarters of a point rise the Fed has done in its previous two meetings. However, Bostic did stress that there is more economic data in the weeks ahead that could change his mind.The PCE reading comes about two weeks after the July consumer price index report, which showed a slower-than-expected rise in prices year over year and 0% inflation on a monthly basis. That report led some Wall Street strategists to say that inflation had likely peaked.Elsewhere in the report, personal income growth for July came in at 0.2% and consumer spending rose 0.1%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting increases of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively."

Bhutto-Zardari, the son of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, said the economic impact was still being assessed, but that some estimates had put it at $4 billion. Given the impact on infrastructure and people's livelihoods, he said he expected the total figure would be much higher.Pakistan's central bank had already flagged the record monsoon rainfall as a threat to economic output given its impact on agriculture.Pakistan would this week launch an appeal asking United Nations member states to contribute to relief efforts, Bhutto-Zardari said, and the country needed to look at how it would handle the longer term impacts of climate change.""In the next phase, when we look towards rehabilitation and reconstruction, we will have conversations not only with the IMF, but with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,"" Bhutto-Zardari said.Bhutto-Zardari said after relief efforts, the country would have to look at how to develop infrastructure that was more resistant to both floods and droughts and address the huge changes faced by the agriculture sector.""Despite the fact that Pakistan contributes negligible amounts to the overall carbon footprint ... we are devastated by climate disasters such as these time and time again, and we have to adapt within our limited resources, however we can, to live in this new environment,"" he said."

JD.com, China's second-largest e-commerce player, posted its slowest revenue growth in history, while electric vehicle maker Xpeng posted a wider-than-expected loss as well as weak guidance.Combined, these companies have a market capitalization of more than $770 billion.In the June quarter, China saw a resurgence of Covid cases. China has stuck to its so-called ""zero-Covid"" policy, a strict set of measures including lockdowns and mass testing to contain the virus. Major cities, including Shanghai, were locked down for several weeks. China's economy grew just 0.4% in the second quarter, and that impacted the strength of the consumer as well as spending from companies in areas like advertising and cloud computing.Those headwinds fed through to China's technology giants.""Retail sales decreased year-over year in April and May due to the resurgence of Covid-19 in Shanghai and other major cities, and has slowly recovered in June,"" Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba, said on the company's earnings call this month.Alibaba's logistics networks in China were also affected, and it said some of its cloud computing projects were delayed.Tencent, the owner of the WeChat messaging app and one of the world's biggest gaming firms, also felt the impact of the zero-Covid policy. Its fintech services revenue grew more slowly than in previous quarters as fewer people were going out and using its WeChat Pay mobile payments service. The company's online advertising revenue also fell sharply as companies tightened their budgets.JD.com fared well in the second quarter because it controls a lot of its logistics supply chain and inventory. However, it did see costs rise for fulfilment and logistics in the face of lockdowns.Electric carmaker XPeng said it expects to deliver between 29,000 and 31,000 vehicles in the third quarter. But that was weaker guidance than the market expected. As well as seasonal weakness, XPeng president Brian Gu said that ""traffic in the stores are less than what we've seen before because (of the) post-COVID situation.""

Over the past two years, China has introduced tougher policy in areas from gaming to data protection.With growth rates falling more sharply than in previous years, investors are cautious on their outlook.""What I find interesting is how the narrative on the big tech companies ... has changed: early on in the pandemic, COVID was expected to benefit the big online platforms at the expense of 'offline' businesses, as much of the economy would be stuck at home with little other choice than to shop online and entertain themselves online,"" Tariq Dennison, wealth manager at GFM Asset Management, told CNBC via email.""The recent revenue and earnings dip hitting these big tech names reflects zero COVID concerns short-term, but also has many long-term investors, including myself, revising our estimates of the long-term growth prospects of these names.""Dennison said that Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com previously sustained more than 25% annual revenue growth and a long-term slowdown would be a concern.""If this quarter is a sign of a permanent slowdown to single digit growth rates, rather than just a temporary dip, that of course would have a significant impact on long-term valuations of these shares,"" Dennison said."
2022-08-29,"Depending on who you ask, the Biden administration's forgiveness of up to $20,000 in federal student loans will either make inflation worse or won't have much impact at all.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) asserts that the debt relief would ""wipe out the disinflationary benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act,"" which was passed into law earlier this month.It estimates that the executive action will cost an ""astronomical $400-$600 billion"" and has previously estimated that $10,000 in forgiveness would add 0.15% to the personal consumption expenditure price index, a commonly used gauge for inflation. Economists at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute pointedly disagree with the CFRB's assessment, arguing that any inflationary effect would be ""small"" and offset by the resumption of student loan payments on Jan.1, 2023.The Center for American Progress — which previously called on the White House to cancel at least $10,000 in student debt — also says the impact on inflation will be ""minor.""Similarly, Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics chief economist, says the effect on inflation is ""largely a wash."" He estimates that student debt forgiveness starting at $10,000 will increase inflation by 0.08%, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), another commonly used measure of inflation. Zandi also expects CPI inflation to be reduced by 0.11% after the payment freeze ends, since borrowers will have to start paying off the remainder of their loans.Whatever the outcome, it will be hard to measure precisely since there are ""so many moving pieces to the inflation picture right now,"" Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, tells CNBC Make It.What's unknown is how canceled student debt will change consumers' spending habits, says House.Even with up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness, many borrowers will still have monthly debt payments to make when the payment freeze ends. But for some, carrying less debt could encourage more spending, in what's known as the wealth effect.Either way, canceling student debt only ""addresses the symptom, rather than the cause of student debt,"" she says.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude declined $5.37, or 5.5%, to settle at $91.64 per barrel. Inflation is near double-digit territory in many of the world's biggest economies. This could prompt central banks in the United States and Europe to resort to more aggressive interest rate increases, which could slow economic growth and weigh on fuel demand.The European Central Bank should include a 75 basis-point interest rate hike among its options for the September policy meeting given exceptionally high inflation, Estonian policymaker Madis Muller said on Tuesday.German inflation rose to its highest level in almost 50 years in August, beating a high set only three months earlier, data showed. Hungary's central bank raised its base rate by 100 basis points to 11.75%.Bets on another oversized Fed rate hike also pushed up the dollar.

2022-08-31,"European bond yields have been pushed higher by expectations of central bank rate hikes.The yield on 2-year German bunds is set for its highest monthly rise since 1981.French and U.K. yields have also moved higher, as bond prices fall. German government bond yields have climbed at their highest rate in decades during August, reflecting red-hot inflation data and rising interest rates. The yield on 2-year bunds issued by Europe's largest economy has rocketed by 85 basis points this month. That's set to be the biggest monthly move higher since 1981, according to Refinitiv data.Meanwhile, the 10-year benchmark bond yield has risen by over 65 basis points, the highest monthly increase since 1990.Two-year yields on German bunds were 1.117% at 8 a.m. ET Wednesday, 2 basis points higher than the previous day. The 10-year yield was up 1 basis point to 1.522%. French bond yields have also climbed, with the 2-year yield rising to a level last seen in 2011 and the 10-year yield rising to a level last seen in 2013. Flash figures published Wednesday morning showed euro zone inflation hit a new record high of 9.1% in August, powered by soaring energy costs and higher prices for food, alcohol and tobacco. Higher interest rates tend to make bonds less attractive and lower their prices, which move inversely to yields. ""European bonds are very much tracking the developments in the energy markets,"" Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at Dutch bank ING, told CNBC via email. ""With energy bills set to jump across Europe, bond markets are concluding that the European Central Bank will be forced into more aggressive hikes in this cycle.""This was intensified by hawkish comments made by Federal Reserve officials at the Jackson Hole symposium, he added.

""If we are right, bond yields should also start to come down again,"" Brzeski said.The outlook for bonds largely depends on how energy trades in the coming weeks as the market focuses on inflation trends, ING's Bouvet added. ""There will come a time this winter when the growth implications will hit home and we expect bond yields to come back down,"" he said. ""This will cause more underperformance of riskier assets, boost safe haven demand for government bonds, and also push markets to question their assumptions in terms of central bank hikes.""The team expects 10-year bund yields to trade through 1% in the first quarter of 2023, down from current levels of 1.5%.Meanwhile, yields on U.K. 10-year bonds are set to record their biggest rise since May 1994 this month, Reuters reported. The 10-year gilt yield was up 8 basis points to 2.793% at 8 a.m. ET, up from 1.72% at the beginning of August. In the U.S., the yield on the 2-year Treasury note has reached a near-15-year high."
2022-08-31,"""Should the nuclear deal be revived, 1-2 million barrels per day of extra oil could hit the market in a comparatively short period of time,"" one commodities analyst told CNBC.Iranian negotiators in mid-August expressed optimism about the prospects for an agreement, with one advisor saying ""we're closer than we've been before"" to securing a deal.But so far, it seems there are a few remaining sticking points that are proving difficult to resolve. The return of the Iran nuclear deal could be imminent — and with it, the return of a lot of oil to international crude markets. Before the U.S. resumed sanctions on Iran after former President Donald Trump left the deal in 2018, Iran was the third-largest producer in OPEC after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. In 2017, it was the fourth-largest oil producer in the world, after the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Russia.""OPEC could easily produce 30.5 million bpd (barrels per day) if Iran comes back and those barrels are not accommodated,"" Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates in London, told CNBC on Tuesday. ""Under this scenario my model shows Brent dipping to $65"" per barrel in the second half of 2023, Varga said. That's a massive drop from the current price of Brent crude, which was trading at just over $101 a barrel on Tuesday morning in New York. Last week, Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, warned that OPEC could be forced to cut oil production. The minister's reasoning was that physical and paper markets are ""disconnected"" with the latter suffering from ""very thin liquidity, extreme volatility,"" he said in an interview with Bloomberg last week.But Iran's potential reemergence on the market is also likely to be a concern, analysts say.  ""OPEC+ might be preparing for the eventual return of Iran,"" Varga wrote in a report Tuesday. ""Should the nuclear deal be revived, 1-2 million barrels per day of extra oil could hit the market in a comparatively short period of time.""  And veteran OPEC analyst Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told the Financial Times last week that ""earlier this year I think it's fair to say Saudi Arabia and other regional actors were reasonably confident the Iran deal wasn't going to happen in the near future … Now that the negotiations have been revived I think they will be focused on both the oil market and the wider security implications of this deal potentially getting over the finish line.""  Iranian negotiators in mid-August expressed optimism about the prospects for an agreement, with one advisor saying ""we're closer than we've been before"" to securing a deal and that the ""remaining issues are not very difficult to resolve."" But so far, it seems there are a few remaining sticking points that are proving fairly difficult to resolve. The main issue of contention between the Iranian and Western camps is an ongoing investigation by the International Atomic Energy Agency — the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog — into unexplained traces of uranium found at Iranian facilities in the early 2000s. Tehran wants the investigation closed before they'll accept any deal; the IAEA and U.S. and European governments are so far refusing.  The nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and penned under the Obama administration along with France, the U.K., Germany, Russia, and China, lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. Since the U.S. withdrawal in mid-2018 however, sanctions have crushed Iran's economy of 84 million people and Tehran has progressively ramped up its nuclear activity in breach of the deal, enriching uranium to the highest levels it has ever enriched and prompting the head of the IAEA to warn that ""only countries making bombs"" are exhibiting this level of activity.    That means the stakes are high, and particularly for the Biden administration, which listed the revival of the deal as a key foreign policy goal. It's also become more urgent as sanctions on Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine slash Europe's oil and gas supply and send prices soaring. While Iranian oil wouldn't fully offset the loss of Russian barrels, it would still help ease supply pressures, analysts say. ""An Iran deal would represent an additional 1.1, 1.2 million barrels per day in crude exports, production and exports. That would happen over the next eight months. So we'd have a material difference on balances globally,"" said Reid l'Anson, senior commodity analyst at commodities data firm Kpler.  But l'Anson doubts the likelihood of a deal being achieved, and he isn't alone. ""The question moving forward is are we actually going to see a deal,"" he said. ""I still think we probably will not just given the fact that it's politically unpopular in America and also even in Iran.""Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group, was more optimistic.""We think a deal is likely; we think it's always been quite close and it's getting much closer,"" he said.""Iran has about 150 to 200 million barrels of crude and condensate floating on the water. As soon as the deal is done … you'll get a rush of that sale of stored oil,"" he said, estimating that Iran would increase its production by about 900,000 barrels a day. That means a significant boost from the current output level of roughly 30 million barrels per day, unless OPEC members substantially lower their oil output. ""That is something that OPEC and OPEC plus has to factor and think about as they think about oil supply policy,"" McNally said.Given the Saudi energy minister's recent comments, it seems the group is certainly thinking about it. But the longer Iran deal negotiations remain stuck over points of contention, the longer OPEC has to prepare — assuming a deal is reached at all."
2022-08-31,"Private payrolls grew by just 132,000 for the month, a deceleration from the 268,000 gain in July, ADP said in its monthly payroll report.August's numbers add to the inflation worries, as the firm reported annual pay up 7.6% for the month. Companies sharply slowed the pace of hiring in August amid growing fears of an economic slowdown, according to payroll processing company ADP.Private payrolls grew by just 132,000 for the month, a deceleration from the 268,000 gain in July, the firm said in its monthly payroll report.The Dow Jones estimate for the ADP count was 300,000.""Our data suggests a shift toward a more conservative pace of hiring, possibly as companies try to decipher the economy's conflicting signals,"" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. ""We could be at an inflection point, from super-charged job gains to something more normal.""August payroll numbers are notoriously volatile. ADP's release also comes at an uncertain time for a U.S. economy which saw negative growth for the first half of 2022 amid the highest inflation the nation has seen since the early 1980s. The more closely watched nonfarm payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics comes out Friday and is expected to show an increase of 318,000.The ADP report had been on public hiatus through the latter part of the summer as the firm adjusted methodology and entered into a partnership with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab.While much of the changes are technical in nature, ADP's count differs in how it accounts for issues such as weather and natural disasters. The company also differs from the BLS in that ADP's count includes any employees active in the company, while the BLS measures only those who have been paid that month.Richardson told media members that the revised approach ""captures a new evolution in how we are viewing data at ADP. This is an independent estimate of private sector employment that leverages the full scale and breadth of ADP microdata based on the clients that we work with every single day.""In addition to the changes in the way the jobs total is counted, ADP now is providing wage information. August's numbers add to the inflation worries, as the firm reported annual pay up 7.6% for the month.From a sector standpoint, services-related industries accounted for most of the jobs, with 110,000 added positions. Leisure and hospitality grew by 96,000 while seeing pay increases of 12.1%. Trade, transportation and utilities contributed 54,000.However, several sectors saw decreases. They included financial activities (-20,000), education and health services (-15,000), and professional and business services (-14,000).On the goods-producing side, construction added 21,000 and natural resources and mining saw a 2,000 gain. Manufacturing was flat.From a business-size perspective, companies with 500 or more employees grew by 54,000. Medium-sized businesses added 53,000, while those with fewer than 50 employees saw a 25,000 gain.Correction: The U.S. economy saw negative growth for the first half of 2022. An earlier version misstated the year."

The country's energy price cap is set to rise by 80% to £3,564 per year from October with further increases expected in early 2023.  LONDON — Sterling in August suffered its sharpest monthly fall against the U.S. dollar since the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, as political uncertainty and a historic cost-of-living crisis weigh heavily on the British currency.Sterling dropped 4.5% against the greenback last month and continued to slide on Thursday, last trading just below $1.16 by mid-morning in London. The pound also fell nearly 3% against the euro last month.The U.K. faces a rapidly deteriorating cost-of-living crisis as food and energy prices soar, with millions of households facing poverty this winter.Meanwhile, a new prime minister will be named next week following a ballot among Conservative Party members, causing uncertainty over the outlook for fiscal policy.The energy crisis arising from Russia's war in Ukraine is now widely expected to push the euro zone and U.K. economies into recession, while some economists still tip the U.S. to avoid the same fate given its relatively stronger economic position and energy independence.In a research note Wednesday, Capital Economics Chief U.K. Economist Paul Dales said this divergence would drive further weakness in both the euro and the pound against the U.S. dollar, and expects sterling to ""plumb new depths"" as political and economic uncertainty continue to hammer U.K. assets.""We think the pound will fall from $1.17 now to around $1.05 by the middle of next year. That would leave it below the levels reached before the 1985 Plaza Accord ($1.09), after the UK left the ERM in 1992 ($1.43), during the 2008/09 Global Financial Crisis ($1.38), after the 2016 Brexit vote ($1.21) and during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis ($1.21),"" Dales said.""In fact, $1.05 would be an all-time record low. At the same time, with high inflation likely to prevent the Bank of England from cutting interest rates as soon as the financial markets anticipate, we expect only a small fall in 10-year gilt yields by the end of this year and a big decline in the FTSE 100.""'Unequivocally bad'Typically, declines in the value of Britain's currency have a mixed effect, since a weaker pound tends to boost housing prices and international trade, which in turn benefits many companies on the export-heavy FTSE 100 index. But Giles Keating, director at Bitcoin Suisse, told CNBC on Thursday that this was not the case this time around.""At the end of the day, I think in the current circumstances, it is unequivocally bad, due to the higher import prices which will feed through into inflation,"" Keating told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" He added that the cushion provided by pent-up pandemic-era savings for middle-income consumers is eroding, removing another support beam from the British economy in the coming months.""If I look beyond that, it is going to be down to what the government does with fiscal policy. Maybe we will have a leader who comes in and does actually put quite a lot of money back into the economy.""'Slowing economy and political paralysis;Former Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to defeat former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak in the race to become Britain's next prime minister, and faces a plethora of challenges, most prominent of which is the spiraling cost-of-living crisis.U.K. inflation hit 10.1% in July and the Bank of England has projected a peak of 13.3% before year-end. The country's energy price cap is set to rise by 80% to £3,564 ($4,128) per year from October with further increases expected in early 2023. Goldman Sachs has projected that U.K. inflation may top 22% early next year. The largest fall in real wages on record is already leading to widespread strike action across the public and private sectors.Adding to the British pound's woes is the persistent strength of the greenback, with the U.S. dollar index hitting a 20-year high last week. The DXY is up more than 13% year-to-date. In a research note Wednesday, UBS strategists projected more short-term gains for the dollar, and revised up the Swiss bank's currency forecasts. UBS now expects the euro to fall to $0.96 and the pound to slide to $1.12 by the end of the year.There is no end in sight for the energy crisis in Europe, UBS warned, as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of abating, while natural gas prices in Europe continue to skyrocket and Brent crude prices remain elevated. ""We retain our positive outlook for oil in the year to come as supply dynamics continue to point to higher prices,"" UBS strategists said.""Separately, a slowing economy and political paralysis are likely to weigh on the British pound. We rate both the EUR and the GBP as least preferred in our FX strategy."""

2022-09-01,"Demand for cybersecurity products and services is holding up, even as economic concerns are eating into other parts of the tech industry.Investors putting money into cyber-focused ETFs have lost less this year than they would have betting on the broader market. ""Cybersecurity is not a discretionary line item,"" CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said on his company's earnings call.  Economic concerns were a major theme across the technology industry during second-quarter earnings season, as companies cautioned about slower spending on ads, gadgets, e-commerce and software. But with interest rates rising and inflation stuck near a 40-year high, one part of the tech sector is still showing booming demand: cybersecurity. Earnings reports this week from CrowdStrike and SentinelOne pleasantly surprised Wall Street, and both companies, which specialize in protecting the many devices attached to corporate networks, boosted their forecasts for the year. ""Cybersecurity is not a discretionary line item,"" CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said on his company's earnings call. Investors heard similar commentary last week from Palo Alto Networks, which reported a profit for the first time in a decade. The data center security company's stock soared 12%, its best performance since its IPO in 2012.And two weeks ago, Cisco said its security business grew faster than all other segments, surpassing analysts' estimates by about $100 million. Security is now Cisco's top investment area, CEO Chuck Robbins told analysts on a conference call, and the company is staffing up as it raises prices to counter higher costs of components it needs to assemble hardware. Across the security landscape, vendors are busy providing tools to big companies concerned about vulnerabilities that have emerged due to the remote work and hybrid phenomenon and an increase in cyber attacks lodged while Russia is at war in Ukraine. ""In transformational projects, the vast majority of our customers continue on their investments here, despite the expected short-term macro impacts,"" Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, said on the call with analysts. ""Security spending is tied into our customers' desires to move to the cloud, drive more direct relationship with their customers, modernize their IT infrastructure, as well as drive efficiencies while adapting to a new way of working. Those efforts continue.""Investors haven't made money on the security bet this year, but they've lost less than if they'd wagered on the broader tech market. Cyber-focused exchange-traded funds from First Trust Nasdaq and Global X (ticker symbol BUG) are down 22% and 19%, respectively, in 2022. The Nasdaq has dropped 25% for the year. Within software, security providers are showing the advantage they enjoy during a period of economic turmoil. Clients can't reduce their spending given the myriad of threats they face and the risks to their business if they're hit with a big ransomware attack. So they're looking elsewhere. Last week, cloud-software maker Salesforce trimmed its fiscal-year guidance and said customers had become more deliberate about purchases. The stock slid 11% over the next three trading sessions. Shares of Zoom also tumbled after the video-calling software company reduced its projections for the full year.Elsewhere in technology, ad-supported businesses like Snap and Facebook have gotten pummeled, while online commerce companies Shopify and Affirm warned of a return to pre-Covid spending patterns. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone marker sees ""pockets of softness"" as fears of an economic slowdown percolate. ""I don't know that anybody's using the recession word,"" said Gary Steele, CEO of Splunk, whose software helps companies analyze data to monitor performance and spot threats, in an interview this week. ""I just think that we saw macro conditions where budgets seemed to be tightening, meaning they had to make a decision about when they wanted something to happen.""  Second-quarter revenue at CrowdStrike rose 58% from a year earlier as the company signed up over 1,700 subscribing clients, more than in any previous quarter. Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike's finance chief, said the company was enjoying ""strong industry tailwinds."" Kurtz told analysts that it's taking longer to do some deals because clients are being forced to get higher levels of required approvals before making purchases. But they're still happening. Jefferies was one of several banks to raise its price target on CrowdStrike, and analysts at the firm said the company should be reasonably sheltered in the case of a recession.SentinelOne CEO Tomer Weingarten touted his company's record-high gross margin and customer retention rate. ""Cybersecurity remains a top priority for enterprise IT spending, a must-buy for all enterprises,"" he said.Palo Alto's Arora said clients signed up for long-term deals during the quarter. That lines up with commentary from Guggenheim analysts, who wrote in a note to clients that security spending among companies they cover hasn't moderated as much as IT spending.Not all companies in the space are seeing a pop. Okta shares tumbled 33% on Thursday, after the provider of secure sign-on software cited a ""weakening economy"" and said it was struggling to integrate salespeople from Auth0, which it acquired last year for $6.5 billion.

2022-09-02,"Pinduoduo launched its U.S. online shopping site on Thursday as the Chinese e-commerce giant makes its first major push overseas.The website called Temu lists items across a number of categories, and could mark a new challenge to U.S. e-commerce leader Amazon.China's biggest technology companies from Tencent to Pinduoduo's e-commerce rivals Alibaba and JD.com continue to pursue international markets. Pinduoduo launched its U.S. online shopping site as the Chinese e-commerce giant makes its first major push overseas.The website called Temu, which went online Thursday, lists items across a number of categories including clothing, jewelry, pet supplies and home and garden, and could mark a new challenge to U.S. e-commerce leader Amazon.Pinduoduo did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.Temu marks Pinduoduo's biggest push overseas yet as the domestic Chinese economy faces a number of challenges from a resurgence of Covid-19 to an energy crunch. That has hurt economic growth in China and dampened consumer sentiment.China's biggest technology companies from Tencent to Pinduoduo's e-commerce rivals Alibaba and JD.com continue to pursue international markets. Pinduoduo, a much younger company than Alibaba and JD.com, having only been founded in 2015, is behind its rivals when it comes to the overseas push.Alibaba took a controlling stake in Singapore-based Southeast Asian e-commerce site Lazada in 2016 and has since invested money in the business to expand its presence in the region. Alibaba also has a separate website called AliExpress that services markets like Europe and the U.S.JD.com meanwhile operates Joybuy.com for international customers.Pinduoduo's Temu is a cross-border e-commerce website with most products likely to come from overseas, especially China. Temu said shipping to the U.S. could take 7-15 business days.""It's important to keep in mind that you may see longer delivery times than you're used to from other e-commerce websites. This is due to the fact that items that may be coming from another country or need to be bundled or packaged with other similar-sized items,"" the website says on the shipping information page.Shipping is free for orders over $49.Pinduoduo could face some challenges in cracking the U.S. market. First it will need to build brand reputation versus the likes of Amazon. And it could also suffer from its relatively long shipping times versus the same-day or next-day deliveries Amazon offers via its Prime subscription services.Temu's ""main challenges will be cultivating trust and awareness among customers,"" Jacob Cooke, CEO of WPIC, an e-commerce tech and marketing firm that helps foreign brands sell in China, told CNBC.There are currently also some categories that have very few products. For example, the men's wristwatch category had just two products listed.However, Temu could compete on price. On Thursday, Temu had a 20% discount offer sitewide. And products appear to be quite cheap. For example, the women's dresses listed were mostly under $20.Temu could also have an advantage due to ""existing relationships with low-cost manufacturers in China that maybe haven't expanded to the U.S. yet,"" Cooke said.Pinduoduo has grown quickly in its seven-year history to become one of China's biggest e-commerce firms. The company has tended to focus on lower-income consumers by offering heavily discounted products. And it has been focusing on bringing agricultural products onto its platform to differentiate from rivals. The company is worth around $87 billion."

Nonfarm payrolls rose solidly in August amid an otherwise slowing economy, while the unemployment rate ticked higher as more workers rejoined the labor force, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.The economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, just below the Dow Jones estimate for 318,000 and well off the 526,000 in July and the lowest monthly gain since April 2021.The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, two-tenths of a percentage point higher than expectations, largely due to a gain in the labor force participation rate to 62.4%, tied for the highest level of the year. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons climbed to 7% from 6.7%.Wages continued to rise, though slightly less than expectations. Average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month and 5.2% from a year ago, both 0.1 percentage point below estimates.Professional and business services led payroll gains with 68,000, followed by health care with 48,000 and retail with 44,000. Leisure and hospitality, which had been a leading sector in the pandemic-era jobs recovery, rose by just 31,000 for the month after averaging 90,000 in the previous seven months of 2022. The unemployment rate for the sector jumped to 6.1%, its highest since FebruaryManufacturing rose 22,000, financial activities gained 17,000 and wholesale trade increased by 15,000.Markets reacted positively to the numbers, with major stock indexes posting strong gains and Treasury yields moving lower. ""There's something for everybody in this report,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""This report supports the Fed's ability to engineer a soft landing. Markets like it.""The jobs numbers pose a quandary for a Federal Reserve trying to get inflation under control.Inflation is running near its fastest pace in more than 40 years as a combination of a supply-demand imbalance, massive stimulus from the Fed and Congress and the war in Ukraine has sent the cost of living soaring.However, the labor market has held strong even as other aspects of the economy have weakened. Housing in particular is likely in a recession.""This is a unique period of time, where we have still a relatively tight labor market, where there is still job growth, but companies have started to announce hiring freezes, some companies have announced layoffs,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ""This could very likely be a recession where you don't see the kind of carnage in the labor market that you see in most recessions.""Those payroll and wage gains came amid soaring inflation and concerns over a slowing economy that posted negative GDP numbers in the first two quarters of the year, generally considered a telltale sign of recession.The Fed has been battling the inflation problem with a series of interest rate hikes totaling 2.25 percentage points that are expected to continue into next year. In recent days, leading central bank figures have warned that they have no intention of backing off their policy-tightening measures and expect that even when they stop hiking, rates will stay elevated ""for some time.""Futures markets pulled back anticipation for a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate increase at the September meeting. The probability for that move was 62% around 10 a.m. ET, down from 75% on Thursday.One key channel where the Fed is looking for policy to have an impact is the jobs market. In addition to robust hiring, job openings are outnumbering available workers by a nearly 2-to1 margin, pressuring wages and creating a feedback loop that is sending prices higher for not only gas and groceries but also shelter and a variety of other expenses.There were some pockets of weakness in the August numbers.Full-time jobs fell by 242,000 while part-time positions gained by 413,000, according to the household survey, which the BLS uses to compute the headline unemployment rate.The jobs report is ""not strong enough to get them to be more aggressive in terms of rate hikes, and not weak enough to have them slow down,"" Arone said. ""I don't think today's jobs report changes anything about the path the Fed was on.""August's payroll numbers are generally more volatile than other months. In 2021, the initial estimate of 235,000 eventually was revised up to 483,000. Over the past decade, the average revision for August has been 82,700 higher.The BLS lowered the June payrolls count to 293,000 from 398,000 and July's to 526,000 from 528,000, a combined net drop of 107,000 from previous estimates."

Its currency has tanked while net foreign reserves have dwindled to just $8 billion in August, according to the State Bank of Pakistan.  Pakistan's foreign minister made an urgent call for international aid, with the death toll from historic flooding across the country expected to rise in the coming days. Already reeling from an economic crisis, flood waters have submerged over one third of the country in water, killing over 1,000 and impacting 33 million people.Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the country's foreign minister, told CNBC's Dan Murphy Thursday that he fears the damages from the natural disaster will exceed current estimates of $10 billion, adding that the crisis in the country is still ongoing and in the ""rescue and relief phase."" The flooding, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC is ""a climate disaster of biblical proportions,"" covers over 95,000 square miles of land. Bhutto Zardari said the crisis is far from over, as ""southern areas of Pakistan are still bracing themselves for the flooding to come through the rivers from the north."" ""Pakistan at this point in time, are paying in their lives and in their livelihoods for a climate disaster that is not of their making,"" he said. Pakistan's contribution to global carbon emissions is less than 1%, but it's among the 10 most affected countries in the world by climate change.The South Asian nation of over 220 million people reported a 27% inflation rate for August, according to government data, and was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its currency has tanked while net foreign reserves have dwindled to just $8 billion in August, according to the State Bank of Pakistan.  Political infighting has gripped the country since April, after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been charged under anti-terror laws by Pakistan's police. Rural areas in Pakistan have been hit the hardest by flooding, which will have a compounded impact on Pakistan's farming industry, and ultimately the cost of food. Bhutto Zardari told CNBC ""about 80 to 90%"" of Pakistan's crops have been damaged by the floods. The International Rescue Committee report that 4 million acres of crops have been destroyed with 800,000 livestock perishing. Prior to the disaster, food inflation in rural provinces was much higher compared to urban areas. For instance, the cost of onions in Pakistan's urban areas increased by 89% from July 2021 to July 2022. In rural areas, that cost increase topped 100%.The International Monetary Fund on Monday approved the release of $1.1 billion to Pakistan in special drawing rights, a part of its bailout program which began in 2019. The money was already part of a relief program to help Pakistan stabilize its economy. Pakistan has now launched a joint appeal with the United Nations for about $160 million, which Bhutto Zardari told CNBC ""is obviously a very conservative estimate about the bare minimum requirements at this moment.""Over a million homes have been destroyed, and Bhutto Zardari added that key infrastructure like bridges, road networks, and dams have been damaged. Pakistan going forward, he says, will need ""large scale reconstruction, which will require a lot of work."""
2022-09-05,"Economists told CNBC that among countries in Southeast Asia, Singapore and Thailand will most likely be the first to be hit if the U.S. heads into recession.Singapore is ""more vulnerable"" to a U.S. recession compared to its regional peers because it's ""very, very dependent,"" said Chua Hak Bin, a senior economist at Maybank.Thailand will also be one of the first to be impacted due to its heavy reliance on tourism. A ""wildcard"" will be the timing of China's reopening, which could determine if the Thai economy comes ""back in full swing,"" Chua said.  SINGAPORE — Asia will not escape unscathed if the U.S. falls into recession, but some countries in Southeast Asia will be more badly hit than others, economists warn.The tug-of-war between inflation and recession in the United States continues as the Federal Reserve sticks to its hawkish stance on interest rate hikes. The U.S. has already reported two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the first two quarters of 2022 — what some consider a ""technical"" recession. Still, there's little consensus on when a full-blown recession might happen. Economists told CNBC that among countries in Southeast Asia, Singapore and Thailand will most likely be the first to be hit if the U.S. heads into recession. Singapore is ""more vulnerable"" to a U.S. recession compared with its regional peers because it's ""very, very dependent,"" said Chua Hak Bin, a senior economist at Maybank.""I suspect [it] will be Singapore first,"" he said when asked which economies in Southeast Asia will be hit first if the U.S. falls into a recession. The island-state will likely be the first because of its export dependency and its small and open economy, Chua said.Selena Ling, chief economist at OCBC Bank agreed with that analysis.""At first glance, I would suspect the more open and trade-dependent Asian economies like [Singapore], Taiwan and South Korea and maybe Thailand would be the usual suspects,"" she said. GDP growth in the country has been ""historically more correlated"" with the U.S. business cycles due to its export-oriented economy, Maybank said in a late-August report.Singapore doesn't have much of a domestic market and relies heavily on trade services for economic growth, Chua explained. This includes shipping activities and cargo operations. The country's trade-to-GDP ratio for 2021 was 338%, according to the World Bank. The trade-to-GDP ratio is an indicator of how open an economy is to international trade.

If the U.S. were to slip into a recession, that ""dependence and causality"" will hit the more export-oriented economies, he added.Singapore is extremely connected with the rest of the world and a ""shock wave"" in any country will definitely have a ripple effect across the city, Irvin Seah, senior economist from DBS Group Research told CNBC. Still, he doesn't expect Singapore to fall into a recession this year or next year.The Maybank report said that if the U.S. heads into recession, the downturn is ""likely to be shallow rather than deep.""However, Chua said the U.S. could possibly face a ""prolonged"" recession and whether Singapore is also headed for a long-drawn recession or not will depend on China's Covid reopening since China is the city-state's largest trading partner.  Singapore is a big exporter of electrical machinery and equipment, but output in its electronics cluster fell 6.4% in July compared with last year, data from the Economic Development Board showed.Output in the semiconductor sector dropped 4.1%, while other electronic modules and components segments shrank by 19.7% due to ""lower export orders from China and [South] Korea,"" said the EDB, a government agency under Singapore's trade and industry ministry.""China is the biggest export market for many ASEAN countries … But exports to China have been terrible,"" Chua said referring the the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ""Because Singapore is so heavily dependent on exports, [it] will feel it.""  China's zero-Covid policy has also hindered Singapore's tourism recovery since the pandemic, economists said.Before the pandemic, some 3.6 million Chinese residents traveled to Singapore in 2019, accounting for 13% of total visitors, according to data from Singapore's tourism board. However, there were only 88,000 visitors between January and December last year. ""When you look at visitor arrivals, it's still roughly less than one third of pandemic levels,"" Chua said. ""China tourists are still absent."" Seah, the economist from DBS, said he does not ""discount the possibility"" that Singapore will experience at least one quarter of negative quarter-on-quarter growth. However, economic conditions are normalizing for the country, he added.""We are definitely much stronger today compared to during the global financial crisis period,"" he said.  Thailand will also be one of the first to be impacted if the U.S. falls into a recession, predicted the economists who spoke to CNBC. The country relies heavily on tourism for its economic growth. Tourist spending accounted for approximately 11% of Thailand's GDP in 2019 before the pandemic. The country welcomed almost 40 million visitors that year and generated more than $60 billion in revenue, according to World Bank data.There were only about 428,000 foreign tourists arrivals in 2021, and its economy grew by only 1.5% — one of the slowest in Southeast Asia, according to Reuters.Thailand could be next to fall into a recession after Singapore, according to Chua. However, a ""wildcard"" will be the timing of China's reopening — which could determine if the Thai economy comes back ""in full swing,"" he added. Chinese tourists have not returned to the Southeast Asian country and that has left Thailand's economy in ""an even more precarious state,"" said DBS Bank's Seah. ""As long as Chinese tourists are not returning, Thailand will continue to struggle. Growth has been weak, inflation is high, [and] the Thai baht is under pressure.""The Thai baht is currently hovering at around 36 baht per U.S. dollar, and is down 20% compared with three years ago, before the pandemic. Thailand's inflation rate hit a 14-year high of 7.66% in June, according to Refinitiv data.The Bank of Thailand has only hiked interest rates once so far since 2018.""Headline inflation is very high in Thailand, but core inflation is not as high, by correlation is not as high. Of course growth has been a lot weaker, so they don't feel any urgency to tighten as aggressively,"" Maybank's Chua said.He pointed out that Indonesia and the Philippines would likely be less impacted by a potential U.S. recession due to their ""domestic oriented economies.""""Indonesia and the Philippines have been more insulated from slowing external demand and US recession, with both economies continuing to expand even in 2008/09 during the global financial crisis,"" the Maybank report said.According to data from the World Bank, GDP growth in Indonesia and the Philippines were higher compared to Singapore and Thailand during the global financial crisis in 2008 to 2009.— CNBC's Abigail Ng and Weizhen Tan contributed to this report.Correction: The headline for this story has been updated to show which Southeast Asian countries will likely be most susceptible to a U.S. recession."
2022-09-05,"Academics and analysts have told CNBC a recession is everything from inevitable to unlikely over the last month.The continued debate reflects a split over whether to focus on falling GDP in real terms, or strength in personal spending and the job market.""We live in a period of multiple shocks – from Covid-19 over energy prices to political deglobalization – which make predictions extremely difficult,"" one economist said. Is the U.S. economy showing no signs of a recession or hurtling inescapably towards one? Is it in fact already in one? More than a month after the country recorded two successive quarters of economic contraction, it still depends who you ask. Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, believes the U.S. is headed for a ""whopper"" of a recession in 2023. While Stephen Roach of Yale University agrees it will take a ""miracle"" for the U.S. to avoid a recession next year — but it won't be as bad as the downturn of the early 1980s. Yet the Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler says he doesn't see ""anything that resembles a recession"" in the U.S. right now, pointing to recent low unemployment, high job vacancies, and the fact that the economy is growing — just not as fast as prices. And market participants are similarly divided. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, says a recession is more likely than a soft landing for the U.S. economy right now, although it may be a rotational recession that hits the economy in pockets. While Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank, was clear in a recent interview with CNBC: the U.S. is not heading for a recession in nominal terms, even if it is in real terms. Recent surveys reflect the split. A Reuters poll of economists in late August put the chance of a U.S. recession within a year at 45% (with most saying one would be short and shallow), and a Bloomberg survey put the probability of a downturn at 47.5%.  So why the discrepancy? It depends what you focus on: gross domestic product (GDP), or the jobs market.U.S. GDP declined by 0.9% year-on-year in the second quarter and by 1.6% in the first, meeting the traditional definition of a recession. The slump in growth was driven by a number of factors including falling inventories, investment and government spending. Inflation-adjusted personal income and saving rates also fell.However, in the U.S. a recession is officially declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which likely won't make a judgment on the period in question for some time.What makes this time different from every other six-month period of negative GDP since 1947 has been continued strength in the jobs market. The closely-watched nonfarm payrolls data for August, released Friday, showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 315,000 — a solid rise, but the lowest monthly gain since April 2021.It added to other recent releases which have shown a slowdown in private payroll growth, but a much higher rate of new job openings than expected. William Foster, senior credit officer at Moody's, said jobs-versus-GDP continued to be the big debate among economic commentators, against a backdrop of the U.S Federal Reserve changing quickly from an accommodative monetary policy — where it adds to the money supply to boost the economy — to a restrictive one, involving interest rate hikes in order to tackle inflation, which hit 8.5% in July.""We're coming out of an extraordinary period that's not been seen before in history,"" Foster told CNBC by phone. When making its decision, the National Bureau of Economic Research looks at real income for households, real spending, industrial production and the labor market and unemployment — and those variables aren't giving clear recession signals, Foster said. ""The jobs market is still struggling to hire people, particularly in the services sector,"" he said. Foster also noted that households were still spending relatively strongly, albeit at a slower rate of growth, enabled by the period of accumulation of household savings during the pandemic.However, at the recent Ambrosetti Forum in Italy, economist Joseph Stiglitz told CNBC he was concerned about the fall in real wages workers were experiencing despite the tight labor market.As well as disagreeing on which indicators to focus on, commentators are also split on what certain sectors are showing.Investor Peter Boockvar says the latest data on housing and manufacturing show why the U.S. will not be able to avoid a recession, with the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropping into negative territory in August.But according to Saxo Bank's Jakobsen: ""We still have double digit increases in the rental market. That is not going to create a recession.""""Simply, people have enough money on the balance sheet to buy an apartment and rent it out and make 20 to 30%. So [a recession] is not going to happen."" There are broader reasons for the current level of debate too, said Alexander Nutzenadel, professor of social and economic history at the Humboldt University of Berlin.""We live in a period of multiple shocks – from Covid 19 over energy prices to political deglobalization – which make predictions extremely difficult,"" he told CNBC by email. This means the economic performance of a highly developed country such as the U.S. depends heavily on external factors.  The current situation of ""stagflation"" — when high inflation and economic stagnation occur simultaneously — is historically rare, he continued, though not completely unprecedented. ""We had a similar moment in the 1970s, but from this experience we know that monetary policy has enormous difficulties to find the right balance between fighting inflation and preventing a recession.""Finally, he noted that the economics profession had become ""much more diverse"" in recent years.""There is no 'mainstream economics' anymore, everything has become controversial, including theory, data and methods,"" Nutzenadel said.The very practice of having a recession officially declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research has recently been questioned by some, with Tomas Philipson, professor of public policy studies at the University of Chicago, recently asking: ""Why do we let an academic group decide? We should have an objective definition, not the opinion of an academic committee.""In any case, Philipson concluded, ""What really matters is paychecks aren't reaching as far. What you call it is less relevant.""— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report."

2022-09-06,"For a second time this year, the People's Bank of China announced Monday it would reduce the amount of foreign currency banks need to hold. Such moves theoretically reduce the weakening pressure on the yuan, which has tumbled to two-year lows against the U.S. dollar in the last few weeks.Upcoming political events in China and concerns about capital outflows prompted the PBOC's latest move to slow the yuan's pace of depreciation, analysts said. BEIJING — China's central bank has sent a strong signal it wants to keep the Chinese yuan from weakening too quickly against the U.S. dollar, economists said.For a second time this year, the People's Bank of China announced Monday it would reduce the amount of foreign currency banks need to hold.Such moves theoretically reduce the weakening pressure on the yuan, which has tumbled by more than 8% this year to two-year lows against the U.S. dollar.Chinese authorities typically emphasize the yuan's level versus a basket of currencies, against which the yuan has strengthened by about 1% over the last three months.However, Beijing's latest actions show how important the yuan-dollar exchange rate still is, Nomura's chief China economist Ting Lu and a team said in a report Monday.They gave two reasons:""First, in a year of the once-in-a-decade leadership reshuffle and with elevated US-China tensions, Chinese leaders especially care about RMB's bilateral exchange rate with USD because they believe RMB/USD somehow reflects relative economic and political strength.""Second, a big depreciation of RMB/USD could dent domestic sentiment and speed up capital flight.""China's ruling Communist Party is set in October to select a new group of leaders, while solidifying President Xi Jinping's power. Tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated in the last several years, resulting in tariffs and sanctions on Chinese tech companies.Meanwhile, China's economic growth has slowed in the last three years, especially with the shock of the pandemic in 2020. Tighter Covid controls this year, including a two-month lockdown of Shanghai, have prompted many economists to cut their GDP forecasts to near 3%.That economic slowdown has contributed to the weakening yuan, which can help make Chinese exports cheaper to buyers in the U.S. and other countries.The U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly this year as the U.S. Federal Reserve aggressively tightened monetary policy.In addition, the greenback — as measured by the U.S. dollar index — has benefited from 20-year lows in the euro and a similar plunge in the Japanese yen. ""We think the PBOC might have tolerance for further CNY depreciation against the USD, especially as the broad USD continues to strengthen, though they might want to avoid continued and too fast one-way depreciation if possible,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Maggie Wei and a team said in a report Monday.The analysts said they expect the yuan to depreciate to 7 against the dollar over the next three months. Nomura's foreign exchange analysts forecast a 7.2 level by the end of the year.The yuan last traded near 7.2 against the dollar around May 2020 and September 2019, according to Wind Information data.""I don't think it will go far beyond [7], certainly sort of beyond the 7.2 that we saw during the trade war,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""

HSBC names 4 Chinese stocks set to benefit from the trendGoldman thinks the trade right now is on China's economy and gives 2 U.S. stocks to play it ""I think that's the key threshold,"" he said. ""I think the reason they're reluctant to allow that to happen is, if it goes beyond that level, then expectations for the currency risk becoming unanchored. You risk seeing much larger-scale capital outflows.""The PBOC on Tuesday set the yuan's midpoint against the dollar at 6.9096, the weakest since Aug. 25, 2020, according to Wind Information. China's central bank loosely controls the yuan by setting its daily trading midpoint based on recent price levels. The PBOC's latest cut to the foreign currency reserve ratio — to 6% from 8% — is set to take effect Sept. 15, according to an announcement Monday on the central bank's website.Earlier on Monday, PBOC Deputy Governor Liu Guoqiang said that in the short term, the currency should fluctuate in two directions and people ""should not bet on a specific point.""That's according to a CNBC translation of a Chinese transcript of Liu's remarks at a press event on economic policy.For the long run, Liu maintained Beijing's hopes for greater international use of the yuan. ""In the future the world's recognition of the yuan will continue to increase,"" he said.— CNBC's Abigail Ng contributed to this report."

Marc D'Amelio told ""Squawk Box"" that his daughters can earn up to six figures for each of their posts on social media. In March, they also announced the launch of the new $25 million VC fund aimed at backing high-growth companies with a focus on women and minority-led startups.TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, has shaken up the social media landscape and is now disrupting other industries as it has become a hit-making machine. Last fall, the app said it topped 1 billion monthly users.

With inflation in the euro zone projected to rise to at least 10% in the coming months and the risk of consumer prices rocketing higher, a ""jumbo"" rate hike of 75 basis points on Thursday is certainly a possibility.""As frontloaded hikes can have a bigger impact on inflation expectations than a more gradual approach, a 75bp move could make sense,"" said ECB watcher and Berenberg's Chief Economist Holger Schmieding in a research note. ""Although it is largely priced in, it could still exacerbate strains in the bond markets.""The recent halt of gas deliveries to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has not only pushed stocks lower and increased the risk of a recession in Europe, it's also pushed Italian government 10-year yields to 4% — the highest level since mid-June before the ECB announced the creation of an anti-fragmentation tool. High yields for Italy — much higher than those in Germany — mean the government in Rome has to pay more to borrow, exacerbating concerns over its hefty debt pile.Inflation in the euro zone hit 9.1% in August and with the continued pressure on energy prices it's expected to reach double-digit levels in the coming months. At the same time the risk of a recession is looming large over the region's economy as consumers feel the pain and scale back their consumption, and companies struggle with high energy prices. ""While governments will partially 'foot the bill', there are limits to what extent the private sector can be shielded from this income shock,"" said Dirk Schumacher with Natixis in a research note to clients. ""The drop in consumer confidence to a record low over the last months, indicates that households are aware of these limits with respect to government support. There is also increasing evidence that companies in energy intensive sectors are reducing production."" Because of the inflation outlook, the ECB is expected to sacrifice growth in order to keep inflation expectations anchored, as this is the bank's core mandate.""A key take away from recent comments by ECB officials is that the hiking cycle will be less sensitive to recession than we thought,"" said Deutsche Bank's Chief Economist Mark Wall in a research note.""We raised our terminal rate forecast by 50bp to 2.5%,"" he added. The ECB's benchmark rate is currently at zero. The Frankfurt institution believes its ""neutral"" rate — an optimal level for a steady economy — to be between 1% and 2% and with inflation risk rising the ECB's Governing Council might need to consider raising rates above that level into tightening territory. That, of course, also raises the question about quantitative tightening — which is the technical description for shrinking the central bank's balance sheet. Selling assets has not yet been discussed by the ECB. ""Given the threat to the ECB's credibility, we also wonder why quantitative tightening is not discussed,"" Anatoli Annenkov of Societe Generale, said in a research note. ""Not using QT should imply higher rates.""Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that inflation in the euro zone hit 9.1% in August.

2022-09-08,"Thieves are targeting certain makes and models of 2010-2021 Kia and Hyundai vehicles that use a mechanical key, not a key fob and push-button to start the car. The thieves are mainly young teens who use a USB cord to hot wire the car. They post videos stealing and driving the cars on social media using the hashtag ""Kia Boys"" — which has more than 33 million views on TikTok.  A dangerous challenge spreading on TikTok and other social media platforms has car owners and police departments on alert across the country — challenging young teens to steal certain cars off the street using a USB cord.The target? Certain makes and models of 2010-2021 Kia and Hyundai vehicles that use a mechanical key, not a key fob and push-button to start the car. Investigators tell CNBC the trend started last year and the number of cars being stolen is continuing to surge across the country. In St. Petersburg, Florida, police reported more than a third of all car thefts there since mid-July are linked to the TikTok challenge. Los Angeles officials say the viral trend has led to an 85% increase in car theft of Hyundais and Kias compared with last year.The story is the same in Chicago, according to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart.""In our jurisdiction alone, [thefts of certain models are] up over 800% in the last month,"" he said. ""We see no end in sight.""The trend challenges teens to steal a car off the street by breaking into the car, popping off the steering wheel column and hot wiring the vehicle using a USB cable, similar to the wire used to charge a phone. ""The viral nature of how this has taken off on social media — it's accelerated this like we've never seen,"" Dart said. ""[The perpetrators are] doing it in 20 to 30 seconds. It literally is as old-fashioned as you can imagine.""Dart told CNBC the thieves are mainly young teens — some, not even old enough to legally drive. The stolen cars are often used for joyrides, or used to commit other crimes and then abandoned on the side of the road, he said.""We had an 11-year-old who was one of our most prolific stealers … the notion that they can drive is a fantasy,"" Dart said. The thieves post videos online of stealing and driving the cars, using the hashtag ""Kia Boys"" — which has more than 33 million views on TikTok. The social media company said in a statement it ""does not condone this behavior which violates our policies and will be removed if found on our platform.""Illinois resident Karen Perkins said her 2019 Kia Sorrento was stolen from in front of her apartment on Aug. 6.""I looked out the window and realized my car was gone,"" Perkins said.Days later, she was in a rental car at a red light when she said her missing Kia drove right past her.""I saw a teenage boy sitting in the front,"" Perkins said. ""I drove around the block … five kids actually jumped into my car — that's when I started to panic — like I'm going to lose my car forever.""Perkins tells CNBC she went on a hunt to track down her Kia. Hours later, she found it deserted on the side of the road and called police. She said the abandoned Kia was left heavily damaged. ""They crashed the front of my car … they damaged the bumper,"" Perkins said. ""They even wrote on the top of my ceiling … it says 'hot car.'""Tom Gerszewski, a Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based filmmaker, tracks the viral crime spree on his YouTube channel in ""Kia Boys Documentary,"" which has already topped 3.7 million views.""This is what they do for after-school entertainment,"" Gerszewski told CNBC. ""They don't really have much of a sympathy for the people that they're doing this to.""Ken McClain, an attorney in Missouri, says some of the blame for the stealing spree falls on the automakers — Kia and Hyundai — claiming the companies built cars that are too easy to steal.McClain calls the issue a ""defect."" His firm has filed class action lawsuits in 12 states so far: California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio and Texas. He's also preparing to file in as many as seven other states.""We're receiving dozens of calls a day,"" McClain said. ""The manufacturer[s] ought to be paying for this.""Kia and Hyundai weren't able to comment on how many vehicles are included in the make and model years and would potentially be at risk.A Kia spokesperson said the company is concerned about the increase in thefts and has provided steering free wheel lock devices to law enforcement officials in affected areas.""It is unfortunate that criminals are using social media to target vehicles without engine immobilizers in a coordinated effort,"" the spokesperson said.""While no car can be made theft-proof, criminals are seeking vehicles solely equipped with a steel key and 'turn-to-start' ignition system. The majority of Kia vehicles in the United States are equipped with a key fob and ""push-button-to-start"" system, making them more difficult to steal. All 2022 Kia models and trims have an immobilizer applied either at the beginning of the model year or as a running change.""A Hyundai spokesperson said the company is pursuing a similar effort to distribute steering wheel locks and that the company will begin selling a security kit next month.According to Dart of the Cook County Sherriff's Office, the old-school wheel lock anti-theft devices could go a long way to thwarting the thefts.""It makes it nearly impossible to maneuver the car,"" he said.— CNBC Specials Page Peter Ferrarse contributed to this report."
2022-09-08,"The Association of American Railroads has released a report projecting the economic impact of a nationwide railroad strike could be more than $2 billion a day.A cooling-off period for negotiations expires September 16, when unions can strike.Five of the 12 unions have reached voluntary agreements with the railroads.Wage increases proposed by an emergency board appointed by President Biden would be the most substantial in at least 40 years of rail labor negotiations. On the heels of the latest round of labor negotiations between the National Mediation Board, unions, and freight railroads, the Association of American Railroads has released a report projecting that the economic impact of a nationwide railroad strike could be more than $2 billion a day.So far, five of the 12 unions, representing 21,000 employees, have reached voluntary agreements with the railroads. The expiration of the 30-day cooling-off period when unions can walk off the job is midnight on September 16. There are just under 115,000 Class I railroad employees in the U.S., according to August data. If a strike happens, the report from the AAR’s policy and economics team — which uses historical data from the Federal Railroad Administration — states that the 140,000-mile network of rails across 49 states and 7,000 Class I trains would be idled, and the impact would cripple both the movement of trade and commuters.There are not enough trucks or truck drivers to move the rail bound containers, according to the report, with an additional 467,000 long-haul trucks per day needed to handle the freight.Logistics CEOs tell CNBC the impact of a nationwide rail strike would impact the economy far more than a port strike on the West Coast.""Depending on the length of any service interruption, the overall impact would double each day the interruption continued,"" said Alan Baer, CEO of OL-USA. ""As we experienced with the ports, delays mounted quickly and it is now taking weeks to unwind. Domestic trucking rates would surge as capacity disappears. Overall a nightmare scenario."" The details of the deal were recommended by the Presidential Advisory Board appointed by President Joe Biden in July to avert a strike. They are non-binding, but if implemented, would see employees receive a 14.1% wage increase effective immediately, and a 24% compounded wage increase during the five-year period from 2020 through 2024. Service recognition bonuses would also be given to employees over the duration of the contract and would total $5,000. Combining the lump sum payments and the retroactive wage increases, employees would receive an average immediate payout totaling more than $11,000.The average pay of a rail employee if the deal is ratified would be approximately $110,000 per year by the end of the agreement. Combined with benefits like retirement, and health care, employees would earn $160,000 a year. If agreed upon, industry insiders tell CNBC the general wage increases will be the most substantial in at least 40 years of rail labor negotiations. According to the industry report, the average U.S. Class I freight rail employee earned wages of $95,700 and fringe benefits of $40,000 in 2020, for total compensation of $135,700.Terms of the deal have to be agreed upon between the unions and railroads.The National Carriers' Conference Committee, which represents freight railroads, declined to comment to CNBC, citing the sensitivity of active negotiations. A spokesperson for the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO — a federation of 37 leading transportation worker unions in the U.S. — also cited the ongoing negotiations in declining to comment.Some holdout unions have recently issued strong statements about their position. The leaders of the BLET and Smart-TD unions said in a Labor Day statement that they had been ""carved out"" from the rest of rail labor as ""we were the only Unions that the Carriers insisted upon work rule changes from throughout the PEB hearing.""""It has become clear in our post Presidential Emergency Board (""PEB"") negotiations with the Rail Carriers that they are counting on the Federal Government to come to their aid if we are unable to reach a Tentative Agreement, and so far, we have not reached an Agreement,"" BLET President Dennis Pierce and SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson stated. ""The same rail carriers that complain about government intervention when the Federal Railroad Administration proposes a rulemaking on crew size, and also shudder at the thought of the Surface Transportation Board issuing regulations that would help shippers, now all but hide behind Congress, refusing so far to negotiate terms our members would accept and ratify.""In a statement, AAR President and CEO Ian Jefferies said, ""As the freight sector heads into peak shipping season, a nationwide rail work stoppage would result in an unnecessary $2 billion daily economic hit. President Biden's PEB recommended terms that would maintain the highest quality health care coverage and result in compounded wage increases of 24%, bonuses totaling $5,000 — the highest pay increases in nearly 50 years.""""Like those unions that have already tentatively agreed to the PEB deal, each of the remaining unions can still enter into agreements based on these recommendations. However, should negotiations fail and result in a work stoppage, Congress must act to implement the PEB recommendations — rewarding employees and stopping unnecessary economic harm and uncertainty for rail customers."" Several major industries including the Fertilizer Institute and Retail Industry Leaders Association have sent letters to Congress urging intervention.""Over half of all fertilizer moves by rail year-round throughout the United States and the timeliness and reliability of fertilizer shipments is absolutely critical,"" TFI said in its letter. ""If farmers do not receive fertilizer, it results in lower crop yields, higher food prices, and more inflation for consumers.""RILA members, which account for more than $1.5 trillion in annual retail sales, wrote, ""Failure to reach a reasonable agreement could result in significant disruptions to the rail network, the retail industry, and ultimately the American consumer.""According to the AAR report, the industries heavily relying on rail to move their products include e-commerce, agriculture, chemical, automotive, construction, and coal.""UPS, for example, may be the single largest rail customer,"" the report stated. ""A single intermodal container or trailer railroads carry for UPS could contain 1,800 to 2,000 packages. A train with 100 containers or trailers could have 200,000 UPS packages headed for our doorsteps.""The report noted the U.S. supply chain would also be disrupted by raw materials delays, such as lumber from Canada used for home building and construction, to autos and auto parts. Amtrak would also be significantly impacted, according to the AAR report, because the passenger railroad service owns a very small fraction of its rail system, with the remaining 97% running on tracks owned and maintained by freight railroads. In addition to the rails itself, the freight railroads also offer services to Amtrak ranging from station maintenance, train dispatching, and emergency repairs to security.Both the union and railroad negotiators will meet again with the National Mediation Board on Thursday and Friday. The negotiations between the 12 railroad worker unions and the National Carriers' Conference Committee have been going on for years."

But as gas prices have gone down, Biden's ratings have started to tick back up, and the administration is keen to promote some wins ahead of the midterms. ""Taken together, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act authorized among the most significant investments our country has ever made,"" Yellen said Thursday.

2022-09-09,"Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Friday made comments indicating he could back another 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase later this month.He further suggested the Fed get away from its practice of providing ""forward guidance"" on what its future path would be. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Friday echoed recent sentiments from his colleagues, saying he expects a big interest rate increase later this month.He also said policymakers should stop trying to guess the future and instead stick to what the data is saying.""Looking ahead to our next meeting, I support another significant increase in the policy rate,"" Waller said in remarks prepared for a speech in Vienna. ""But, looking further out, I can't tell you about the appropriate path of policy. The peak range and how fast we will move there will depend on data we will receive about the economy.""Those comments are similar to recent remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Vice Chair Lael Brainard and others, who said they are resolute in the effort to bring down inflation. Markets strongly expect the central bank to take up its benchmark borrowing rate by 0.75 percent point, which would be the third consecutive move of that magnitude and the fastest pace of monetary tightening since the Fed began using the benchmark funds rate as its chief policy tool in the early 1990s.While Waller did not commit to a particular increase, his comments had a mostly hawkish tone that indicated he would support the 0.75-point move, as opposed to a half-point increase.""Based on all of the data that we have received since the FOMC's last meeting, I believe the policy decision at our next meeting will be straightforward,"" he said. ""Because of the strong labor market, right now there is no tradeoff between the Fed's employment and inflation objectives, so we will continue to aggressively fight inflation.If the Fed does implement the three-quarter point hike, it would take benchmark rates up to a range of 3%-3.25%. Waller said that if inflation does not abate through the rest of the year, the Fed may have to take the rate ""well above 4%.""He further suggested the Fed get away from its practice of providing ""forward guidance"" on what its future path would be and the factors that would come into play to dictate those moves.""I believe forward guidance is becoming less useful at this stage of the tightening cycle,"" he said. ""Future decisions on the size of additional rate increases and the destination for the policy rate in this cycle should be solely determined by the incoming data and their implications for economic activity, employment, and inflation.""Waller pointed out welcome signs that inflation is moderating from its highest peak in more than 40 years.The personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose 6.3% from a year ago in July — 4.6% excluding food and energy. That's still well above the central bank's 2% long-run goal, and Waller said inflation remains ""widespread"" even with the recent softening.He also noted that inflation looked to be softening at one point last year, then turned sharply higher to where the consumer price index rose 9% on a year-over-year basis at one point.""The consequences of being fooled by a temporary softening in inflation could be even greater now if another misjudgment damages the Fed's credibility. So, until I see a meaningful and persistent moderation of the rise in core prices, I will support taking significant further steps to tighten monetary policy,"" he said.Kansas City Fed President Esther George also spoke Friday, echoing concerns over inflation but also advocating a more deliberate approach to policy tightening.""As unsatisfying as it might be, weighing in on the peak policy rate is likely just speculation at this point,"" she said.""We will have to determine the course of our policy through observation rather than reference to theoretical models or pre-pandemic trends,"" George added. ""Given the likely lags in the passthrough of tighter monetary policy to real economic conditions, this argues for steadiness and purposefulness over speed.""George was the only Federal Open Market Committee member to vote against June's three-quarter point rate increase, advocating instead for a half-point move, though she did vote for the July hike."
2022-09-09,"Stocks rallied on Friday to help all three major averages snap three-week losing streaks. The Dow finished up 2.8% on the holiday-shortened week, while the S&P 500 rose 3.8% and the Nasdaq gained 4.2%."
2022-09-12,"The August consumer price index will be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET, and it is expected to show inflation is moderating.The report could be confusing because economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect headline CPI to decline by 0.1%, but it is expected to rise by 0.3% excluding energy and fuel.The report is seen as key guidance for next week's Federal Reserve rate decision, but economists say it is also critical for the longer-term view on interest rates since it could show whether some causes of inflation are receding. Inflation is still sizzling hot but is expected to have moderated in August, as gasoline prices dropped, supply chains improved and the cost of travel fell.The consumer price index will be released Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET, and the report could be a bit messy since headline inflation is expected to fall while core inflation, excluding energy and food, should rise. The report is also key because it is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on how much to raise interest rates next week — and more importantly, in the long term.CPI for all items is projected to have actually declined by 0.1% month over month in August, after a flat reading in July, according to Dow Jones. On an annual basis, headline CPI would then be running at a pace of 8%, down from 8.5% in July. But excluding gasoline, core CPI is expected to rise by 0.3%, the same as July. On a year-over-year basis, that would make for a 6% increase, even hotter than the 5.9% gain in that month.For the Fed, the report is widely expected to confirm it needs to keep up its fight against inflation with an interest rate hike next week of 0.75 percentage point, the third of that size in a row. If the inflation data is weaker than expected, some economists say there's an outside chance the Fed could raise by just a half percent.""If anything, the risk is it could come in a little bit weaker,"" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. ""I have energy goods down 10.2%. That should knock off a half percent. I think the core is going to be more important."" Gasoline prices are the biggest driver of the decline in energy. Since peaking at $5.01 in mid-June, the national average for unleaded gas has dropped all summer, to an average of $3.71 per gallon Monday, according to AAA.Markowska expects headline CPI to decline by 0.2%, but sees a rise in core of 0.3%. Shelter is one area expected to rise, while used car prices are forecast to fall.""I think we're going to see a repeat in terms of airfares and hotel prices. They dragged down the core CPI last month. It looks like airfares will be down 8%,"" said Markowska. ""They were up 40% from March to May. We're just unwinding a portion of that.""Economists say the base effects of comparing the number to last year are behind the jump in August core inflation. ""Because of base effects annual core inflation will likely accelerate in the next two reports, which would make uncomfortable headlines for the Fed,"" wrote Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. She said that it should not matter to central bank officials because they will be more focused on momentum, and will be watching the three-month and six-month annualized pace.""But they are also sensitive to how it will look to the public and Congress. Even more reason to maintain a hawkish focus,"" she added.Strategists say the Fed's Sept. 21 rate decision may be affected by the August CPI report, but the details inside that report may be more important in terms of what they say about the longer-term outlook. That could help shape the expectations for the Fed's end, or terminal, rate when it stops hiking. Market expectation for the Fed's terminal rate have been inching higher, and in the futures market, the view is it will reach 4% by early next year. Markowska expects it could reach 4% to 4.25% in January.""This is where we start looking for whether there is a shift in core patterns, where the Fed can ramp down or not,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. She expects policymakers to raise the fed funds target range by 75 basis points next week. That would take the fed funds target range to 3% to 3.25%. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.""This gets them into tight policy. Then it's a question of how tight do they want to go,"" Swonk said.This is a key question for markets, since some pros expect the Fed to pause by year-end. Others expect a pause early next year, and some investors believe the central bank will begin to reduce interest rates in the second half of 2023.Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have emphasized that they will raise rates and keep them there. Yet, the market is still betting that policymakers will not be as tough as their talk.""I don't think this report changes much for the Fed. I think the problem for the Fed is even as inflation is slowing, growth momentum is picking up in part because energy prices are lower,"" Markowska said. ""That's boosting purchasing power.""She said consumers appear to be diverting dollars that had been going to fueling their cars to other goods and services. That could keep the economy hotter than the Fed desires, and she is now expecting growth in the third quarter of 3% or more.""That's above-trend growth at a time when the Fed needs to engineer below-trend growth,"" Markowska said."

As U.S. interest rates rise, there are concerns it could lead to capital outflows for some economies as investors seek higher returns in the U.S.""Many countries, they're raising the interest rates just to keep [sic] the difference between the Fed rate and the local interest rate. But that's not the case for Thailand,"" the Thai finance minister told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Thursday.  ""I think when we look at the capital inflow and outflow, we still have the net inflow of capital. As you can see, our stock market although is very volatile at this time, foreign buyers are still net buyers for capital in Thailand.""Not everyone agrees.Capital Economics senior Asia economist Gareth Leather said the Thai central bank might be too optimistic given that the Thai baht has fallen 12% peak-to-trough in the past year and foreign exchange reserves have dropped sharply. ""In terms of monetary policy, the central bank is certainly taking a gamble,"" Leather said. ""It is true that the factors pushing inflation higher, energy and food, have been on the supply side, and tighter monetary policy will not directly affect that. But raising rates just once while headline inflation has increased from 3.2% in January to 7.9% currently, is a risk.""The Bank of Thailand's inflation target is between 1% to 3%, but headline inflation hit 7.86% in August.Thailand raised its key policy rate by 25 basis points in August from a record low of 0.5%, and the one-day repurchase rate currently stands at 0.75%. The last time the central bank raised the benchmark rate was almost four years ago in December 2018. Instead of racing to hike rates, Termpittayapaisith said it's important to take a more balanced approach to monetary policy especially when the Thai economy is recovering and the country is still experiencing net capital inflows.""The central bank is very, very careful in raising the interest rate… at the same time our economy has to recover.""The finance minister also said since global inflation was caused by supply side disruptions, hiking up rates to curb demand might not be an effective approach. He said he was not worried about servicing foreign debt — even as the Thai baht continues to depreciate against the U.S. dollar — since there are other growth engines in Thailand beyond the tourism sector. ""I'm not worried because debt service is still in our capacity, particularly for... the public debt,"" Termpittayapaisith said. ""I think once the economy recovers, I think we are not worried about that.""Aside from tourism, Termpittayapaisith said the government was expecting increased foreign direct investments in its Eastern Economic Corridor,  a new economic zone in the country's eastern provinces. The number of tourists is expected to rise to between 8 million to 10 million next year, about a quarter of pre-Covid numbers, according to Termpittayapaisith. On Thursday, the Thai government also said it wanted to increase its rice exports. Earlier last week, the Thai National Shippers' Council reaffirmed Thailand's exports were still on track to rise between 6% to 8% this year.  In line with Termpittayapaisith's comments, DBS Group Research economist Chua Han Teng said there had been net portfolio capital inflows into Thai equities and bonds since the start of the year and he expected the Thai central bank to take a moderate path with rate hikes. ""Foreign equity inflows are performing notably better than the past two years, likely on expectations that Thailand has started to recover from the pandemic, driven by improved tourism and private consumption activity,"" Chua said. ""Our expectations are for the Bank of Thailand to proceed with gradual policy rate hikes and monetary normalization as it balances rising inflation with a smooth economic growth lift-off.""However, he said Thailand's continued ""negative policy interest rate differential"" with the U.S. could be problematic for the country, especially since the Federal Reserve has shown it has more appetite to raise rates which could then heighten risks of capital outflows.  "
2022-09-12," Stocks fell sharply on Tuesday after a key August inflation report came in hotter than expected, hurting investor optimism for cooling prices and a less aggressive Federal Reserve.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1,276.37 points, or 3.94%, to close at 31,104.97. The S&P 500 dropped 4.32% to 3,932.69, and the Nasdaq Composite sank 5.16% to end the day at 11,633.57.Just five stocks in the S&P 500 finished in positive territory. Tech stocks were hit particularly hard, with Facebook-parent Meta skidding 9.4% and chip giant Nvidia shedding 9.5%.The drop erased nearly all of the recent rally for stocks, pulling the S&P 500 back toward its Sept. 6 close of 3,908 and causing some traders to glance back at mid-June, when the index fell below 3,700.""I think we may even go back and retest the June lows,"" UBS director of floor operations Art Cashin said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""""Certainly the 3900 is just so tempting, and you're pulling back below the 50-day moving average here. It's very much about the technicals. It's not so much that the one number made the economy go topsy-turvy. It meant a lot of guys who were making preliminary favorable bets got caught off base,"" he said.The August consumer price index report showed a higher-than-expected reading for inflation. Headline inflation rose 0.1% month over month, even with falling gas prices. Core inflation rose 0.6% month over month. On a year-over-year basis, inflation was 8.3%.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a decline of 0.1% for overall inflation, with a rise of 0.3% for core inflation.The report is one of the last the Fed will see ahead of their Sept. 20-21 meeting, where the central bank is expected to deliver its third consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike to tamp down inflation. The unexpectedly high August report could lead the Fed to continue its aggressive hikes longer than some investors anticipated.The moves comes after four straight positive sessions for U.S. stocks, which were bolstered in part by the belief of many investors that inflation had already peaked.""The CPI report was an unequivocal negative for equity markets. The hotter than expected report means we will get continued pressure from Fed policy via rate hikes,"" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors.

""Shelter and wage inflation together are such a leading indicator into how close we are to price pressures abating. They tend to be sticky. ...

A basis point equals 0.1 of a percentage point.They announced the change after the August consumer price index came in up 0.1%, while economists polled by Dow Jones had expected a decline of 0.1%.

The Fed has widely been expected to hike by three quarters of a point, or 75 basis points next week. The hot CPI report now has some investors thinking a 1 percentage point hike is possible. ""Probably 75 (basis points) is the most likely play, but the market is pricing 79 basis points. So there's a shot at 1,"" said Michael Schumacher of Wells Fargo.In the fed funds futures market, expectations for the terminal rate, or rate where the Fed is expected to stop hiking, also shot up. ""It exploded. It's 4.19 and it was at 3.99"" before CPI, Schumacher said. That means traders are betting the Fed will take fed funds target to 4.19% by March. The fed funds rate range is currently 2.25 to 2.5%.The market had been trading on the view that if CPI showed moderation, the Fed might be able to pause its rate hiking early next year. The last CPI report was a surprise to the downside, and the jobs number was strong.""This ends the whole fairy tale that the Fed would get three good reports in a row."" Said Schumacher.

2022-09-13,"The consumer price index increased 0.1% in August. Excluding food and energy, the inflation gauge rose 0.6%, both higher than expected.Costs were driven by increases in food, shelter and medical care services, offsetting a sharp decline in gasoline prices.Real average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation rose 0.2% for the month. However, they remained down 2.8% from a year ago. Inflation rose more than expected in August as rising shelter and food costs offset a drop in gas prices, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.The consumer price index, which tracks a broad swath of goods and services, increased 0.1% for the month and 8.3% over the past year. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, CPI rose 0.6% from July and 6.3% from the same month in 2021.Economists had been expecting headline inflation to fall 0.1% and core to increase 0.3%, according to Dow Jones estimates. The respective year-over-year forecasts were for 8% and 6% gains. Energy prices fell 5% for the month, led by a 10.6% slide in the gasoline index. However, those declines were offset by increases elsewhere.The food index increased 0.8% in August and shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the weighting in the CPI, jumped 0.7% and are up 6.2% from a year ago.Medical care services also showed a big gain, rising 0.8% on the month and up 5.6% from August 2021. New vehicle prices also climbed, increasing 0.8% though used vehicles fell 0.1%.Markets slumped after the news, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 350 points after being higher earlier.""Today's CPI reading is a stark reminder of the long road we have until inflation is back down to earth,"" said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction for Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Office. ""Wishful expectations that we are on a downward trajectory and the Fed will lay off the gas may have been a bit premature.""Treasury yields leaped higher, as the 2-year note, which is most closely tied to Federal Reserve interest rate moves, surged 0.13 percentage point to 3.704%.Markets had been widely expecting the Fed to enact a 0.75 percentage point rate increase at its meeting next week. Following the CPI release, traders took the possibility of a half-point move completely off the table and even were pricing in a 10% chance of a full percentage point hike, according to CME Group data. ""They're watching for where inflation is coming from,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. ""It's very clear to them that it's food, it's transportation and it's rent. Rent keeps marching higher. That is the most stubborn of everything the Fed is fighting at this point.""The report presented conflicting sides of the inflation picture.After peaking above $5 a gallon this summer, gasoline prices have pulled back sharply. However, the cost of living in other key areas such as food and shelter continues to push higher, raising concerns that inflation that had been concentrated is now beginning to spread.Within the jump in food costs, bread prices rose 2.2% on the month and are up 16.2% from a year ago. Eggs surged another 2.9% and are up 39.8% for the 12-month period, and canned fruits increased 3.4% and 16.6%, respectively.On the plus side, airline fares continued their recent decline, off 4.6% on the month though still 33.4% higher than a year ago.There also was some good news for workers in the August report, as real average hourly earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month. However, they remained down 2.8% from a year ago.To combat the broad surge in the cost of living, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times this year for a total of 2.25 percentage points. Tuesday's report was not expected to have great impact on the September meeting but rather through the end of the year and into 2023 as the central bank looks to tame inflation without tanking the economy.The economy has broadly struggled in 2022 after posting its best year since 1984 last year, and inflation has played a major role. Gross domestic product contracted in each of the first two quarters, meeting a widely accepted definition of recession, and is on track to rise at just a 1.3% annualized pace in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.The Federal Reserve is hoping to slow a labor market that has posted solid job gains through the year. Specifically, policymakers are concerned about a huge gap between job openings and available workers as labor force participation is stuck below its pre-pandemic levels. That has resulted in rising wages that have in turn put pressure on prices."
2022-09-13,"Markets expect the central bank to enact a third consecutive 75 basis point hike at its monetary policy meeting later this month.Prins told CNBC on Tuesday that the acceleration of interest rate hikes to soothe the markets was disconnected from the economic reality faced by many. The U.S. Federal Reserve could be forced to pivot away from its path of aggressive interest rate hikes in three stages, according to author Nomi Prins.Markets expect the central bank to enact a third consecutive 75 basis point hike at its monetary policy meeting later this month, the fastest pace of monetary tightening since policymakers began using the benchmark Fed funds rate as the principal policy tool in the early 1990s.Various Fed officials have reiterated the Federal Open Market Committee's commitment in recent weeks to reining in inflation, but Prins told CNBC Tuesday that the acceleration of interest rate hikes to soothe the markets was disconnected from the economic reality faced by many.""This period of accelerating the rate hikes that we've seen so far has impacted the real economy because it has squeezed the borrowing costs … for real people, real consumers,"" she said.""Whereas for the Street in general, historically money still remains cheap and leverage still remains high in the system, and the Fed's book still remains just a touch under $9 trillion, which is double what it was going into the pandemic period, and since the financial crisis of 2008."" Despite the broad market expectation for further 75 basis point hikes, Prins – a global economist and outspoken advocate for economic reform – said the Fed would likely pivot away from its hawkish trajectory in three stages as the disconnect between wealthy investors and institutions and the ""real economy"" widens.Having firstly reduced the pace of rate hikes to 50 basis points and then neutralized policy, Prins expects the Fed to begin reversing course and becoming ""accommodative,"" with the U.S. already having recorded two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.""Whether that's to cut rates or to increase the size of its book again, that still remains to be seen,"" Prins added.Inflation worldwide has been driven skyward by supply chain bottlenecks in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, lingering supply blockages in China due to recurring lockdowns, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has caused food and energy prices to surge.Central banks have argued that aggressive action is needed to prevent inflation becoming ""entrenched"" in their respective economies, and have been particularly wary of consumer price inflation feeding through to wage inflation, which they anticipate could further exacerbate demand and therefore price increases. At his speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium in late August, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell responded to market concern about an impending recession caused by tightening monetary conditions by asserting that ""some pain"" for the economy would be necessary in the fight against inflation.Prins argued that by targeting wage inflation when wage rises are failing to keep pace with broader inflation was a mistake.""I think the Fed absolutely is missing this connection between what is going on for real people in the real economy and why, and how that relates to the overall inflation picture, which it has basically positioned itself to fight. There's just a mismatch here,"" she said.She argued that central banks raising rates as their main tool to fight inflation has caused a ""chasm"" between the individuals and institutions that were able to leverage themselves into the markets when borrowing costs and prices were considerably lower, and the average consumer."
2022-09-13,"Rather than fuel, it was food, shelter and medical services that drove costs higher in August, slapping a costly tax on those least able to afford it.The food at home index, a good proxy for grocery prices, has increased 13.5% over the past year, the largest such rise since March 1979.For medical care services, the monthly increase of 0.8% was the fastest monthly gain since October 2019. Veterinary care was up 10% from a year ago. For the better part of a year, the inflation narrative among many economists and policymakers was that it was essentially a food and fuel problem. Once supply chains eased and gas prices abated, the thinking went, that would help lower food costs and in turn ease price pressures across the economy.August's consumer price index numbers, however, tested that narrative severely, with broadening increases indicating now that inflation could be more persistent and entrenched than previously thought.CPI excluding food and energy prices — so-called core inflation — rose 0.6% for the month, double the Dow Jones estimate, bringing year-over-year cost-of-living increases up 6.3%. Including food and energy, the index rose 0.1% monthly and a robust 8.3% on a 12-month basis. At least as important, the source of the increase wasn't gasoline, which tumbled 10.6% for the month. While the summertime decline in energy prices has helped temper headline inflation numbers, it hasn't been able to squelch fears that inflation will remain a problem for some time. Rather than fuel, it was food, shelter and medical services that drove costs higher in August, slapping a costly tax on those least able to afford it and raising important questions about where inflation goes from here.""The core inflation numbers were hot across the board. The breadth of the strong price increases, from new vehicles to medical care services to rent growth, everything was up strongly,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""That was the most disconcerting aspect of the report.""Indeed, new vehicle prices and medical care services both increased 0.8% for the month. Shelter costs, which include rents and various other housing-related expenses, make up nearly a third of the CPI weighting and climbed 0.7% for the month.Food costs also have been nettlesome.The food at home index, a good proxy for grocery prices, has increased 13.5% over the past year, the largest such rise since March 1979. Prices continued their meteoric climb for items such as eggs and bread, further straining household budgets.For medical care services, the monthly increase of 0.8% is the fastest monthly gain since October 2019. Veterinary costs rose 0.9% on the month and were up 10% over the past year.""Even things like apparel prices, which often decline, were up a little bit [0.2%]. My view is that with these lower oil prices, they stick and assuming they don't go back up, that will see a broad moderation of inflation,"" Zandi said. ""I have not changed my forecast for inflation to get back to [the Federal Reserve's 2% target] by early 2024, but I'd say I hold that forecast with less conviction."" On the positive side, prices came down again for things such as airline tickets, coffee and fruit. A survey released earlier this week by the New York Fed showed consumers are growing less fearful about inflation, though they still expect the rate to be 5.7% a year from now. There also are signs that supply chain pressures are easing, which should be at least disinflationary. But about three-quarters of the CPI remained above 4% in year-over-year inflation, reflecting a longer-term trend that has refuted the idea of ""transitory"" inflation that the White House and the Fed had been pushing.And energy prices staying low is no given.The U.S. and other G-7 nations say they intend to slap price controls on Russian oil exports starting Dec. 5, possibly inviting retaliation that could see late-year price increases.

Markets are betting the central bank raises benchmark rates by at least 0.75 percentage point next week, which would take the fed funds rate to its highest level since early 2007.""Two percent represents price stability. It's their goal. But how do they get there without breaking something,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. ""The Fed isn't finished.

2022-09-14,"Growth in global oil demand is set to grind to a halt in the fourth quarter of the year as the economic slowdown deepens, the International Energy Agency says.Growth will resume strongly in 2023, according to the agency. Growth in global oil demand is set to grind to a halt in the fourth quarter of this year as an economic slowdown deepens, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday, but said it would resume strongly in 2023.    The outlook preserves a relatively bullish view for robust growth next year despite economic headwinds, built on the expectation that China's COVID lockdowns will ease while growth in air travel will boost jet fuel demand.""Global oil demand remains under pressure from the faltering Chinese economy and an ongoing slowdown in OECD economies,"" the Paris-based energy watchdog said in its monthly oil report.The IEA cut its forecast for demand growth this year by 110,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 2 million bpd while keeping its 2023 growth forecast of 2.1 million bpd.Rich countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) accounted for most of the rise in demand this year, while countries outside the group especially China will underpin growth next year provided Beijing relaxes its COVID curbs.""Non-OECD countries will cover three-quarters of 2023's gains if China reopens as expected,"" the IEA added. Offsetting the hit to demand by the economy, a switch from gas to oil for power generation will provide a 700,000 bpd boost in the last quarter of this year and the first of the next especially in Europe and the Middle East.Meanwhile Russian oil exports are set for a bumpy ride as the European Union plans to impose a ban on maritime services transporting it on Dec. 5.The ban will push Russian oil production down to 9.5 million bpd by February next year, the IEA said, a 1.9 million bpd drop compared to February 2022. A plan by G7 countries to cap Russian oil sales prices and not ban the trade may ease those losses. "

If you're an investor, maybe the best thing to do here is — since you can't guess the bottom — is to take opportunities on days like today and buy stocks that you think are attractive."" His comments came hours after the U.S. consumer price index report showed August inflation was hotter than expected, despite a decline in gas prices. Stocks tumbled across the board and the Dow fell 1,200 points in its worst day since June 2020, as investors brace for more rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve to help tamper rising prices.""It was assumed only 48 hours ago that the Fed's terminal rate would be 4%. And that would be the maximum in terms of rate hikes, but we're past that now,"" O'Leary said, referring to the end rate, or the level at which the U.S. central bank is expected to stop hiking rates. ""There's a bet going on in the market, you can see it as volatility. In fact, it may be significantly higher than 4%,"" he said, predicting the Fed will likely raise at least 75 basis points, most likely a full percentage point. He is not alone in that prediction, Nomura is also expecting the central bank to hike rates by 100 basis points next week.""That level of uncertainty in terms of terminal rates, where the Fed will stop raising, is now officially an unknown. And so that's extremely problematic for the markets,"" said the venture capitalist.Inflation rose more than expected in August as rising food and shelter costs offset the dip in gas prices, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.CPI, which tracks a broad basket of goods and services, increased 0.1% for the month, and 8.3% compared to a year ago. Excluding volatile energy and food costs, August CPI rose 0.6% from the previous month, and 6.3% year-on-year. O'Leary said the bulk of the economy is still robust, and the Fed will continue to raise rates until they see ""some kind of slowdown.""""The consumer economy, which is 65% of the economy, still remains strong. Employment rates still remains strong,"" he said. ""And what we need to see is that slowing.""The food index jumped 0.8% in August and shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the weighting in the CPI, hiked 0.7%. Energy prices fell 5% for the month, but the declines were offset by the aforementioned increases. O'Leary added that the market rallied for the last three sessions because of the idea that inflation would start to show fatigue and slow, but that did not happen.""Nothing else [aside from gasoline prices] slowed down… Everything else continued to rise. And so we're in a very difficult situation here,"" he said. ""We gave up an entire three days of gains in about 11 minutes of trading right out of the gate this morning."" However, the drop in housing prices was not reflected in the latest CPI data and the risk of the Fed overshooting remains, he added. Housing data in CPI takes 16 to 18 months to be correctly reflected, and that there's a disconnect because housing is a big part of inflation data.""The way the Fed is calculating inflation is that the change in housing prices which has started to drop, is not reflected in the CPI data,"" he said.""This really means that there's some risks that the Fed overshoots."""
2022-09-14,"In July, 83% of more than 900 respondents in China said they felt the impact of inflation, up from 69% in November 2021, according to Oliver Wyman.That's despite a far smaller increase in the Chinese consumer price index versus that in the U.S.""It would take a smaller increase in prices to raise concerns among households if the growth backdrop is weaker,"" said Ben Simpfendorfer, Hong Kong-based partner at Oliver Wyman. BEIJING — Chinese people say they're increasingly feeling the pinch of rising prices, although official data show inflation running at a far lower pace than in the U.S. and other countries.That's according to surveys conducted by consulting firm Oliver Wyman and released this month.In July, 83% of more than 900 respondents said they felt the impact of inflation, up from 69% in November 2021, the report said.China's consumer price index hit a two-year high in July with a 2.7% increase year-on-year, due primarily to a rebound in pork prices. The index moderated in August to show a 2.5% year-on-year rise.That's well below the U.S., which overnight reported a 8.3% year-on-year increase in consumer prices in August. Rising food and shelter costs offset a decline in gas prices.For comparison, Oliver Wyman's survey of more than 1,200 Americans in July found 92% said they felt the impact of inflation on everyday life, up from 79% in November. That still shows a greater impact of inflation in the U.S. than in China, although the share of affected respondents jumped by 1 percentage point more in China than in the U.S.It's important to remember the surveys measure sentiment and aren't necessarily a proxy for the consumer price index, said Ben Simpfendorfer, Hong Kong-based partner at Oliver Wyman. He cautioned that responses in China were likely influenced not just by actual price increases but also the overall slower growth environment.""It would take a smaller increase in prices to raise concerns among households if the growth backdrop is weaker,"" he said.More than half of respondents in China said that due to the possibility of a recession, they've gone out less for food and entertainment, as well as switched to cheaper brands and services when possible. Concerns about an economic slowdown have risen around the world. Although the International Monetary Fund in July said it still expects China to be one of the faster-growing large economies in the world this year, the country's gross domestic product is on track to slow sharply from last year.Nearly one-third of respondents in China said they were worried about their job security due to inflation, versus 13% in the U.S., the Oliver Wyman survey found. The study primarily covered people living in China's largest cities, the firm said. About 20% of survey respondents were concerned about inflation's impact on their ability to pay rent or mortgage, while roughly 40% were worried about their ability to pay for groceries and essential goods.Unemployment among China's young people age 16 to 24 has surged to nearly 20%, while that of working adults in cities is about 5.4%, according to an official survey for July. Chinese consumers said they felt that gas prices had the most notable increase in the year through July, followed by appliances and home renovations, the Oliver Wyman survey found.When asked what purchase they might delay as a result of inflationary pressures, respondents mentioned automobiles the most, followed by leisure travel, the report said.Potential purchase delays add to China's ongoing lackluster consumer demand.China's ""zero-Covid policy is a major deflationary force, which supports production but saps demand,"" Macquarie's chief China economist Larry Hu said in a Sept. 9 report. Property troubles are ""another major deflationary force,"" he said.Hu pointed out that excluding food and energy, China's consumer price index only rose by 0.8% in August. ""The message is pretty clear to China's policymakers: deflation, not inflation, is the main risk faced by China at this stage.""

Iran will need sanctions to be lifted if it hopes to strengthen economic ties with China — and that can only come with a successful nuclear deal.The Islamic republic, which has business dealings with China, currently faces a slew of U.S. sanctions that's devastated its economy.On Thursday, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Uzbekistan.It comes as the Islamic Republic prepares to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security group made up of Russia, China, India, Pakistan and four Central Asian countries.Iran currently holds observer status in the SCO, but is due to become a full-fledged member at the upcoming summit in the city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan. Iran's bid to become a member of the SCO doesn't necessarily indicate Tehran will enjoy a smooth economic relationship with China, Ali Ahmadi, an executive fellow at the Geneva Center for Security Policy, told CNBC Tuesday.""It's not going to mean that Iran does not need the sanctions relief,"" Ahmadi said. ""Iran sells some oil to China… but the relationship between the two is very much one-dimensional."" In mid-2018, the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal — formally referred to as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA.Since then, Washington has imposed sanctions on Iran that's crushed its economy. The U.S. sanctions extend to companies doing business with Iran and a ban on all imports originating from Iran, amongst other embargoes.""In order for that relationship to grow, you need sanctions relief, because a lot of companies, even state-owned enterprises in China… don't have the appetite for sanctions risks,"" Ahmadi said.Earlier this month, the U.S imposed sanctions on Chinese firms that helped sell Iranian oil. U.S. sanctions will make Chinese companies think twice about dealings with Iran, especially if the firms are very dependent on the West, Djavad Salehi Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, told CNBC.""Chinese producers are highly dependent on exports to the West, for which they must observe U.S. unilateral sanctions, no matter how much they assure their Iranian counterpart that they consider them unfair,"" Isfahani said. However, sanctions may benefit more risk-tolerant consumers, said Behnam Taleblu, senior fellow of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.Oil sanctions that are not enforced — or are sporadic — could be opportunities for risk-tolerant traders, while smugglers may find creative ways to generate revenue, according to Taleblu. Iran recently started to actively pivot towards the East. Before the U.S. pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced that one of the top priorities for its foreign policy was ""preferring the East over West.""Last month, former Trump administration national security advisor John Bolton told CNBC that lifting sanctions on Iran could push the Islamic state to establish closer ties with both China and Russia.Bolton said that relieved from international sanctions, Iran would become richer and stronger, making it ""a better partner for Russia.""""In the Middle East, where [Russia and China] have overlapping interests, their preferred partner is Iran. So it's a kind of three-way arrangement that I do think has global implications,"" Bolton said."
2022-09-16,"Last week, Truss announced an emergency fiscal package involving the capping of annual household energy bills at £2,500 (£2,891) for the next two years.Although details are set to be announced later this month, the government is expected to fund the difference arising from the price cap through borrowing, rather than a windfall tax on energy companies proposed by opposition parties. LONDON — New British Prime Minister Liz Truss faces a confluence of economic challenges, but will need to balance her own ideals with the immediate needs of the country.Last week, Truss announced an emergency fiscal package involving the capping of annual household energy bills at £2,500 (£2,891) for the next two years, with an equivalent guarantee for businesses over the next six months and further support in the pipeline for vulnerable sectors. The plan is expected to cost the public purse more than £130 billion, with new Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng expected to outline how it will be funded later this month, but is broadly seen by economists as a positive step to limit inflation and reduce the immediate risk of recession.Former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak's energy rebate package for households will remain in force, while the Bank of England will establish a liquidity facility to aid firms in the wholesale energy market to weather extreme price volatility.Energy planThe fiscal package remains ""pivotal"" to the U.K.'s growth outlook, according to Modupe Adegbembo, G-7 economist at AXA Investment Managers, who suggested in a research note Monday that the support to real incomes and growth boost will ""likely be enough to prevent the economy slipping into a prolonged recession.""U.K. GDP grew by 0.2% month-on-month in July, official figures revealed on Monday, below consensus expectations for a 0.4% expansion. GDP contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of 2022, and Adegbembo suggested that the additional public holiday this month for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II may tip the U.K. into a technical recession this quarter.The announcement has led major banks to rapidly reappraise their inflation projections. Barclays now expects inflation to close out 2022 at slightly below 9%, well below the Bank of England's 13.3% projected peak, and the British lender cut its forecast for 2023 CPI inflation from 9% to 5.5%.U.K. inflation unexpectedly cooled in August, new data showed on Wednesday, so the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee may be revisiting its outlook. However, economists were cautious of calling the peak, with some speculating that last month's reading may have been a ""fluke"" on a broader upward trajectory.  Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation rose to 13.1%, further compounding the day-to-day struggles facing household finances.""Although the first-order impact of 'Trussonomics' will be to lower inflation over the next twelve months, the sheer scale of stimulus is likely to add to inflation in the medium term, pointing to a higher terminal rate than the (Bank of England's) MPC had previously embedded,"" said BNP Paribas Chief European Economist Paul Hollingsworth.""Indeed, we note that the MPC is even further behind the market-implied terminal rate than when it began its tightening cycle.""Although details are set to be announced later this month, the government is expected to fund the difference arising from the price cap through borrowing, rather than a windfall tax on energy companies proposed by opposition parties.""A package funded through public debt issuance would not be consequence-free for markets and would need to be factored in by the BoE when deciding on the operational details of its QT [quantitative tightening] programme, in particular the size of active sales and the start date,"" Barclays Chief U.K. Economist Fabrice Montagne said in a note last week.Inflation and a tight labor marketThe Bank of England has deferred its next monetary policy decision until Thursday Sept. 22 due to the death of the British queen. The Bank launched its biggest interest rate hike for 27 years in August and is broadly expected to opt for another 75 basis point rise this month.""Following the announcement of the energy bills support package, we increased our Bank Rate forecasts; we now expect rates to reach 3.5% by year end,"" AXA's Adegbembo said. ""Whilst the package is set to reduce headline inflation, the boost to growth it will provide leaves the Bank of England with more to do to ensure inflation returns to target.""AXA expects a 75 basis point hike this week, in line with market expectations, with further 50 basis point increases anticipated in November and December. Truss was highly critical of what she considered the Bank of England's failure to nip inflation in the bud during her campaign for the Conservative Party leadership, and is reportedly considering a review of its mandate. Governor Andrew Bailey has repeatedly affirmed the Bank's imperviousness to political pressure, but BNP's Hollingsworth suggested that with inflation so high, ""the optics of under-delivery are different against the current backdrop.""Truss's government and the central bank also have to contend with a historically tight labor market, with U.K. unemployment at a 48-year low and the economic inactivity rate at a five-year high, fueling further fears that inflation will be entrenched in the British economy.Real wages — taking into account inflation — excluding bonuses fell by 2.8% in the three months to the end of July.Tax reformDuring her campaign, Truss argued in favor of tax cuts to boost growth and advocated for the controversial theory of ""trickle-down"" economics. She promised to cancel Sunak's hikes to corporate tax and National Insurance — a tax on earnings — which had been deployed to bolster the public purse in order to address the cost-of-living crisis directly.The scrapping of both policies is expected to cost the public purse around £30 billion, with Kwarteng to set out details in his mini-budget later this month.The energy price freeze and broad tax cuts have drawn criticism for disproportionately aiding the country's wealthiest households.The Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank focused on living standards for low- and middle-income households, projected that the overall support package would benefit the highest-income decile of the population by £4,700 per year on average, while the poorest decile would receive £2,200.Although Kwarteng's mini-budget will offer more details on how the tax cuts and energy package will be funded, many commentators and political opponents have suggested that Truss's opposition to levying windfall taxes on oil and gas companies — which have enjoyed record profits due to soaring energy prices — means the costs may well be recouped from taxpayers and cuts to investment in public services.Truss repeatedly rejected the idea of direct government intervention to cap household energy bills while on the campaign trail, only to announce the new bumper fiscal package a week later. Economists will be watching for any hints of further U-turns coming down the pike as the new prime minister weighs her economic principles against the country's precarious position."
2022-09-16,"Sen. Lindsey Graham's new bill to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy divided Republicans on the key election issue, as some strategists questioned whether it would hurt the party in the midterms.Democrats held up the bill as proof that the GOP seeks to restrict abortion nationwide if it wins control of Congress in the midterms.The Supreme Court pushed abortion to the political forefront when it struck down Roe v. Wade, overturning decades-old federal protections. Republicans are distancing themselves from Sen. Lindsey Graham's new proposal to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, as Democrats hold up the bill as proof the GOP seeks to restrict abortion nationwide if it wins control of Congress in the November midterm elections.In Graham's proposal, Democrats see another chance to leverage an issue that has appeared to boost their chances of holding at least one chamber of Congress.The South Carolina Republican introduced the legislation less than three months after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, overturning decades-old federal abortion protections — and positioning abortion as a top issue in the midterms. Graham's announcement on Tuesday drove a fresh wave of headlines about abortion, as Democrats lined up to condemn the bill that would sharply narrow access to the procedure in blue states. It siphoned attention away from another major headline of the day, a worse-than-expected inflation report that sent stocks plunging and was seen as a blow to the Biden administration's claims of a recovering economy.Graham's approach also contradicted a strategy taken by some Republicans, including those in high-profile races, after the high court's abortion ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. Many in the GOP have argued states, rather than the federal government, should set abortion law.In Pennsylvania, one of a handful of battleground states that will determine which party wins the Senate, the new bill spurred Republican Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz to say that he would keep the federal government from interfering with state-level abortion rules if elected. But Herschel Walker, the Republican vying for incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock's Georgia seat in another critical race, said he would back Graham's legislation.In both states, the Democratic candidates used the issue to bash their GOP rivals.""Oz needs to tell us — yes or no, would you support this bill?"" Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the state's Democratic Senate nominee, said in a statement Thursday morning. ""I'll go first: I'm a HELL NO.""Graham's move baffled even some Republican political experts. Some media outlets panned it as an unforced error at a pivotal moment when the fight over the House and Senate appears to have tightened.""I don't know why he did it,"" said Georgia-based GOP strategist Jay Williams. He suggested that Republicans' midterm pitch should focus mostly on the economy, where President Joe Biden has scored low approval marks.""If you're winning the game, you don't switch strategies,"" Williams said. ""If we're talking about anything else, I think it's a bad idea.""Seth Weathers, a former Trump campaign aide in Georgia and political strategist, said he is ""a little fearful that the way it's going to be sold to the public could hurt Republicans in the midterms.""Julianne Thompson, a political strategist and self-described pro-life Republican, said the economy ""is the issue that is winning for Republicans right now and the issue they need to be focused on.""National GOP groups have hardly leapt to back Graham this week.Facebook and Twitter pages for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican National Committee have not mentioned or promoted Graham's bill since it was announced. None of those groups' Facebook pages have launched ads related to the bill, according to the Meta Ad Library.A Twitter account managed by the RNC tweeted about abortion without mentioning Graham on Wednesday, when it accused a pair of Democrats, Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, of refusing to recognize any limits to the procedure. The NRSC on Wednesday did the same, tweeting a criticism of the abortion stance of Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who is challenging GOP Sen. Marco Rubio for his seat in Florida.Graham attempted to frame his legislation as a response to Democrat-led proposals to codify abortion protections at the federal level. One such bill, put forward in May in reaction to a draft of the court's ruling on Roe, failed in the Senate.""They chose a bill that would not put us in the mainstream of the world but put us in a group of seven nations that allow abortion on demand pretty much up to the point of birth,"" Graham said at a press conference Tuesday.Graham said his bill, which bans the procedure at 15 weeks' gestation and includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, would set America's abortion policy at a level that is ""fairly consistent with the rest of the world.""""And that should be where America's at,"" the senator said.The plan would leave in place stricter state abortion laws. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., has put forward a companion bill for the House.While the title of Graham's bill suggests it would bar only ""late-term"" abortions, it would restrict the procedure nationwide after less than four months of pregnancy, a threshold that falls within the second trimester. Abortions are typically considered ""late term"" at 21 weeks of pregnancy or later, according to the health-policy nonprofit KFF. But the organization notes that phrase is not an official medical term, and that abortions at that stage are rarely sought and difficult to obtain.Graham's bill has virtually no chance of passing the current Congress, where Democrats hold slim majorities in the House and Senate. Republicans hope to take over both chambers in the midterms, when the incumbent president's party has historically underperformed.But some forecasters are now favoring Democrats to keep control of the Senate, a shift that has been attributed in part to the high court's ruling in Dobbs. Republicans are favored to take the House, though the odds have moved slightly toward Democrats after that ruling came out in late June.Public opinion of the high court sunk after Dobbs, which overturned Roe in a 5-4 vote by a majority that includes three justices nominated by former President Donald Trump. Abortion rights, meanwhile, have spiked as a top issue among voters.A Fox News poll conducted in September and released Wednesday found 57% of voters support legal abortion in all or most cases, a 13-point jump from May.The same survey showed that voters' opposition to the Dobbs decision has only grown in the months since it came out, as respondent disapproval outweighed approval by nearly a 2 to 1 margin. And the survey found that among voters who see abortion as a chief concern, 56% would back the Democrat in their House district, versus 27% who would choose the Republican.Some Republicans, including GOP candidates in pivotal Senate races, have backed Graham's new proposal.""I have always been pro-life,"" Rubio said when asked why he signed on to the bill. He pressed reporters to ask Democrats what abortion restrictions they would support, if any.Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he backed the bill. He told CNN that it changes the narrative that Republicans support a total abortion ban ""and gives candidates a place to be for something that reflects their views and doesn't fit the Democrats' narrative.""Pennsylvania-based Republican political strategist Christopher Nicholas echoed that view, telling CNBC that Graham's bill marked ""the first strategic response from our side on this issue since the Dobbs decision.""""It could force the press to get the [Democrats] to acknowledge that the only accepted abortion position on their side is abortion on demand,"" Nicholas said.But other top Republicans either refused to back Graham's bill or expressed a belief that individual states should set their own abortion laws.""I think most of the members of my conference prefer that this will be dealt with at the state level,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who would set the GOP's abortion agenda if the party wins Senate control in November, told reporters Tuesday when asked about Graham's bill.Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the NRSC, did not express support for the bill during an interview Wednesday on Fox News.""Well, if you go around the country, what people are focused on is the economy, their kids' education, public safety,"" Scott said when asked about the legislation. ""With regard to abortion, Democrats are clearly focused on abortion,"" he added.Asked for comment on the reactions to the bill, Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop noted that Rubio ""has come on board.""Republicans have long opposed abortion, and numerous red states imposed blanket bans on the procedure immediately after Roe's reversal. But as polls show the majority of Americans disapprove of the court's ruling — and as women reportedly outpace men in voter registrations in key states — many in the GOP have struggled to counter Democrats, who have made abortion a major piece of their message.""Although abortion is not going to decide the midterms, it has been an issue that Democrats have been fundraising on and using to get more women registered to vote,"" said Thompson, the Republican strategist.""I am very cognizant of the fact that my party needs better messaging on this issue,"" along with more women leaders speaking about abortion and related issues, she said.The RNC earlier this week advised campaigns to seek ""common ground"" on exceptions to abortion bans, and to press Democrats on their own views, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. The national party also encouraged candidates to focus on topics such as crime and the economy, the Post reported.""The polls must be teaching them something, because I'm not hearing about abortion today,"" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said on the House floor Wednesday. ""What is their position now? America wants to know.""Some Republican candidates who previously touted hardline positions on abortion during GOP primaries have softened or muted their views as they compete in general elections. As Graham's bill brought a renewed focus to the issue, Democrats pounced.""Herschel Walker thinks it's a problem our country doesn't have a national abortion ban,"" Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said of his Republican rival in a tweet Tuesday, before posting a video of Walker saying as much.In Pennsylvania, Fetterman scheduled a press conference with OB/GYNs at Philadelphia city hall to criticize the proposed 15-week abortion ban. He pushed his opponent, Oz, to answer questions about his stance on the bill.Oz, the Trump-backed celebrity doctor who is trailing Fetterman in the polls, ""is pro-life with three exceptions: life of the mother, rape and incest,"" his spokeswoman Brittany Yanick said in a statement.""And as a senator, he'd want to make sure that the federal government is not involved in interfering with the state's decisions on the topic,"" she said."

2022-09-19,"UBS downgraded its full-year growth forecasts from 3% to 2.7% for 2022 and from 5.4% to 4.6% for 2023.Zero-covid policy has essentially ""stomped on human investor confidence in China,"" said Mattie Bekink, China director for the Economist Intelligence Corporate Network.Goldman Sachs economists said the next key level to watch for the Chinese currency is 7.2 against the dollar. Despite an upbeat batch of economic data from China last week, including retail sales and industrial production beating estimates, economists are standing by their pessimism.UBS downgraded its full-year growth forecasts from 3% to 2.7% for 2022 and from 5.4% to 4.6% for 2023.""While some of the current policy support will bear more fruit in Q4, the Covid situation will likely remain challenging into the winter and early 2023, and export growth is set to slow,"" UBS chief China economist Tao Wang said in the note.Wang adds that the revised 2023 forecast is still based on a scenario where the property market stabilizes soon and Covid restrictions ease from March onward.But those restrictions have dragged down investor sentiment and that's unlikely to rebound any time soon, Mattie Bekink, China director for the Economist Intelligence Corporate Network, said ­­on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""""We're not seeing the policy-levers being pulled necessary to facilitate a change,"" she said of the nation's zero-Covid policy.

2022-09-19,"This was CNBC's live blog tracking developments on the war in Ukraine. See here for the latest updates.  Longtime Russian pop singer and celebrity Alla Pugacheva spoke out against the Ukraine war on an Instagram post to her 3.4 million followers, which received more than 600,000 likes and scores of supportive comments. Acts of public dissent are rare since Russia imposed a law threatening up to 15 years' imprisonment for spreading ""fake news"" about what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.Russian troops struck a nuclear power plant in the country's southern Mykolaiv region, but while its buildings sustained damage, its reactors are functioning normally, Ukrainian state energy officials said.The war ""isn't going too well"" for Russia, U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley said from Poland, adding that this could make Moscow's reactions less certain and that U.S. forces in Europe need to maintain alertness.Meanwhile, reports show Russian President Vladimir Putin relying increasingly on ad hoc volunteer forces for its Ukraine combat operations, sidestepping his country's military high command after a series of setbacks in recent weeks.  Mon, Sep 19 20227:33 PM EDT Turkish lenders Isbank and Denizbank have suspended use of Russian payment system Mir, the banks said, following a U.S. crackdown on those accused of helping Moscow skirt sanctions over the war in Ukraine.The moves, announced separately, came after Washington expanded its sanctions last week to include the head of the entity running Mir, which is popular with the tens of thousands of Russian tourists who arrived in Turkey this year.The suspensions by two of the five Turkish banks that had been using Mir reflect their effort to avoid the financial cross-fire between the West and Russia, as the Turkish government takes a balanced diplomatic stance.Isbank, whose shares tumbled 10% on Monday, said it halted Mir payments and is evaluating the U.S. Treasury's new sanctions. Isbank also said it was keen to comply with national and international laws, regulations and commercial business principles.— Reuters  Mon, Sep 19 20224:48 PM EDT An explosion near a Ukraine power plant damaged windows and power lines but did not impact the operation of the three reactors there, Kyiv told the International Atomic Energy Agency on Monday.The blast from the shelling occurred about 300 meters, or 984 feet, from the industrial site of the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant in Mykolaiv Province, the IAEA said in a press release.No staff were injured by the missile, which impacted three power lines that were swiftly reconnected, Ukraine's nuclear operator Energoatom told the IAEA.Ukrainian authorities reportedly called the shelling an act of ""nuclear terrorism"" by Russia.The IAEA also said its experts discovered that a power line used to supply electricity to another nuclear plant, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, had been disconnected Sunday.Zaporizhzia, located in southeastern Ukraine, is Europe's largest power plant, and has six reactors that are currently in a ""cold shutdown state,"" the IAEA said. The plant still receives the electricity it needs for essential safety functions, but it now does not have access to back-up power from the Ukrainian grid, the IAEA experts said.The disconnected power line transferred electricity from the Ukrainian grid through the switchyard of a nearby thermal power station, the IAEA said. It was not immediately clear how the line was disconnected.""The situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant remains fragile and precarious,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in the press release.""Last week, we saw some improvements regarding its power supplies, but today we were informed about a new setback in this regard. The plant is located in the middle of a war zone, and its power status is far from safe and secure. Therefore, a nuclear safety and security protection zone must urgently be established there,"" Grossi said.— Kevin Breuninger  Mon, Sep 19 20224:02 PM EDT Lawmakers will vote next week on whether to add $12 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine to the budget, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Sunday.The proposed boost in military funding for Kyiv comes as Ukrainian forces appear to be making significant gains as they wage a counteroffensive against invading Russian troops.Those gains coincide with Russia's attendance at this week's United Nations General Assembly, Schumer said during a press conference. ""It's going to hear from world leaders what an outlier nation and outlaw nation Russia is,"" he said, according to an NBC News transcript of his remarks.Additionally, Congress faces an end-of-the-month deadline to pass a stopgap spending bill, called a continuing resolution, that would keep the government from shutting down until mid-December, Schumer noted.""Ukraine depends on our aid. And now that they have begun to really push back the Russians, more aid at this point is crucial,"" Schumer said.Democrats could face hurdles from Republicans wary of tacking on more money to the continuing resolution, a spokesman for Schumer told CNBC on Monday.— Kevin Breuninger  Mon, Sep 19 20223:21 PM EDT EDITORS NOTE: This post shows graphic content of mass graves uncovered near Izium, Ukraine. The Kremlin denied that Russian forces carried out executions of civilians in the Ukrainian city of Izium following a grizzly discovery of more than 400 mass graves.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian troops of committing war crimes in the eastern Ukrainian city.""More than 400 bodies were found at the mass burial site in Izyum with signs of torture.

Greece was the latest NATO ally to sign ratification documents on September 15.In May, both nations began the formal process of applying to NATO as Russia's war in Ukraine raged. All 30 members of the alliance have to ratify the countries' entry into the group.Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden signed ratification documents following a 95-1 Senate vote to bring Finland and Sweden into NATO.— Amanda Macias  Mon, Sep 19 20221:50 PM EDT Russia has lost 55 aircraft in Ukraine since the invasion began, U.S. Air Force Gen.

2022-09-19,"Crisis-hit Sri Lanka will make a presentation to its international creditors on Friday, laying out the full extent of its economic troubles and plans for a debt restructuring and multi-billion dollar International Monetary Fund bailout.Years of economic mismanagement combined with the Covid-19 pandemic have left Sri Lanka in its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948, causing it to default on its sovereign debt.  Crisis-hit Sri Lanka will make a presentation to its international creditors on Friday, laying out the full extent of its economic troubles and plans for a debt restructuring and multi-billion dollar International Monetary Fund bailout.Years of economic mismanagement combined with the Covid-19 pandemic have left Sri Lanka in its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948, causing it to default on its sovereign debt.The country's Ministry of Finance said in a statement via legal firm Clifford Chance that an online call on Sept. 23 would be open to all its external creditors and be ""an interactive session"" in which participants can ask questions. Sri Lanka's woes came to a head in July when then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country and resigned after violent public protests.His replacement Ranil Wickremesinghe has managed to reach a preliminary deal with the IMF that if formalised would provide the country $2.9 billion in loans over four years.""Authorities intend to update their external creditors on the most recent macroeconomic developments, the main objectives of the reform package agreed with the IMF... and the next steps of the debt restructuring process,"" the statement dated Sept. 17 said.Debt crisis veterans cite uniquely difficult elements in Sri Lanka. The impoverished population that forced Rajapaksa to flee still needs to accept Wickremesinghe, seen by many as of the same political ilk, and who faces a bristling opposition.The country's borrowings are so complex that estimates of the total range from $85 billion to well over $100 billion. Perhaps most challenging of all, competing regional powers China, India and Japan must also find common ground on how to reduce debt they are owed by Colombo."
2022-09-20," Wall Street finally looks to be embracing the idea that the Federal Reserve will hike rates into restrictive territory and stay there, according to the latest CNBC Fed Survey.The central bank is forecast to keep hiking until the rate peaks in March 2023 at 4.26%. There is growing concern among respondents that the Fed will overdo its tightening and cause a recession. Wall Street finally looks to be embracing the idea that the Federal Reserve will hike rates into restrictive territory and stay at that high rate for a substantial period. That is, the Fed will hike and hold, not hike and cut as many in the markets had been forecasting.The September CNBC Fed Survey shows the average respondent believes the Fed will hike 0.75 percentage point, or 75 basis points, at Wednesday's meeting, bringing the federal funds rate to 3.1%. The central bank is forecast to keep hiking until the rate peaks in March 2023 at 4.26%.The new peak rate forecast represents a 43 basis point increase from the July survey. Respondents on average forecast the Fed will remain at that peak rate for nearly 11 months, reflecting a range of view of those who say the Fed will maintain its peak rate for as little as three months to those who say it will hold there for up to two years.""The Fed has finally realized the seriousness of the inflation problem and has pivoted to messaging a positive real policy rate for an extended period of time,"" John Ryding, chief economic advisor at Brean Capital, wrote in response to the survey.Ryding sees a potential need for the Fed to hike as high as 5%, from the current range of 2.25%-2.5%. At the same time, there is growing concern among the 35 respondents, including economists, fund managers and strategists, that the Fed will overdo its tightening and cause a recession.""I'm fearing they are on the cusp of going overboard with the aggressiveness of their tightening, both in terms of the size of the hikes along with (quantitative tightening) and the speed at which they are doing so,"" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in response to the survey.Boockvar had been among those who had urged the Fed to pivot and tighten policy very early on, a delay that many say has created the need for officials to move quickly now.Respondents put the recession probability in the U.S. over the next 12 months at 52%, little changed from the July survey. That compares with a 72% probability for Europe. In the U.S., 57% believe the Fed will tighten too much and cause a recession, while just 26% say it will tighten just enough and cause only a modest slowdown, a 5-point drop from July.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, is among the few optimists.He says the Fed ""has a real chance at a soft-landing"" because the lagged effects of its tightening to date will reduce inflation. But that's provided it doesn't hike too far. ""All the Fed has to do to enjoy a soft landing is stand down after raising the funds rate to 3.25%, allow real GDP growth to remain positive, and take all the credit as inflation declines while real growth persists,"" Paulsen wrote.The bigger problem, however, is that most respondents do not see the Fed succeeding at hitting its 2% inflation target for several years.Respondents forecast the consumer price index will end the year at a 6.8% year-over-year rate, down from the current level of 8.3%, and fall further to 3.6% in 2023.Only in 2024 does a majority forecast the Fed will hit its target. Elsewhere in the survey, more than 80% of respondents said they made no change to their inflation forecasts for this year or next as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act.In the meantime, stocks look to be in a very difficult spot.Respondents marked down their average 2022 outlook for the S&P 500 for the sixth straight survey. They now see the large-cap index ending the year at 3,953, or about 1.4% above Monday's close. The index is expected to rise to 4,310 by the end of 2023.At the same time, most believe markets are more reasonably priced than they were during most of the Covid pandemic.About half say stock prices are too high relative to the outlook for earnings and the economy, and half say they are too low or just about right.During the pandemic, at least 70% of respondents said stock prices were too high in nearly every survey.The CNBC risk/reward ratio --- which gauges the probability of a 10% upside minus downside correction in the next six months --- is closer to the neutral zone at -5. It has been -9 to -14 for most of the past year.The U.S. economy is seen running at stall speed this year and next with just 0.5% growth forecast in 2022 and little improvement expected for 2023 where the average GDP forecast is just 1.1%. That means at least two years of below trend growth is now the most likely case.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics wrote, ""There are many potential scenarios for the economic outlook, but under any scenario the economy will struggle over the next 12-18 months.""The unemployment rate, now at 3.7, is seen rising to 4.4% next year. While still low by historical standards, it is rare for the unemployment rate to rise by 1 percentage point outside of a recession. Most economists said the U.S. is not in a recession now."
2022-09-20,"For European businesses, ""we talk about a complete readjustment of our view on China over the last six months,"" said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.Foreign direct investment from the EU into China dropped by 11.8% in 2020 from a year earlier, according to the chamber's position paper. More recent figures weren't available.European businesses that have remained in China increasingly face an environment in which ""ideology trumps the economy,"" the chamber's position paper said in its executive summary. BEIJING — European businesses in China are revaluating their market plans after this year's Covid controls further isolated the country from the rest of the world, said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.China's stringent Covid policy has restricted international travel, and business activity — especially after a two-month lockdown this year in Shanghai.The tough measures of the last two years initially helped China recover more quickly from the pandemic's shock compared to other countries.But the policy increasingly contrasts with a world that's increasingly relaxing many Covid restrictions.For European businesses, ""we talk about a complete readjustment of our view on China over the last six months,"" Wuttke told reporters at a briefing for the chamber's annual China position paper, released Wednesday. He said the lockdowns and uncertainty for businesses have turned China into a ""closed"" and ""distinctively different"" country that might prompt companies to leave.So far, most companies haven't left — only some very small ones, Wuttke said. But he pointed out the chamber isn't able to survey businesses that decided not to enter China at all.Foreign direct investment from the EU into China dropped by 11.8% in 2020 from a year earlier, according to the chamber's position paper. More recent figures weren't available. ""While there are still 'a select group of high-profile multinational companies ready to make billion dollar splashes,' the trend of declining FDI is unlikely to reverse while European executives are heavily restricted from travelling to and from China to develop potential greenfield projects,"" the paper said.China's economy grew by 2.5% in the first half of the year, well below the official target of around 5.5%. Beijing indicated in late July the country might not reach that target.Meanwhile, authorities have showed little sign of removing the so-called dynamic zero-Covid policy.China has reduced quarantine time for international and domestic travelers. But sporadic lockdowns, whether of the tourist island of Hainan or the city of Chengdu, has kept business uncertainty elevated.Wuttke said he expects the earliest China could open its borders is late 2023, based on the time needed to vaccinate enough of the population. European businesses that have remained in China increasingly face an environment in which ""ideology trumps the economy,"" the chamber's position paper said in its executive summary.""I've been here on and off 40 years and I've never seen anything like this, where all of a sudden, ideological decision-making is more important than economic decision-making,"" Wuttke said. ""And maybe that's also amplified by voices from the outside, America[n] sanctions, America cutting off China, so I can understand partly why self-reliance is so high on the agenda."" He was referring to China's push in the last few years to build up its own tech and other industries.Meanwhile, among other measures, the U.S. has restricted its companies from supplying key components to Chinese tech companies such as Huawei.The chamber did not specifically state what this ideology consisted of, but said China's Covid policy embodies the country's ""move away from the rest of the world.""

What to know about the new investing landscape The policy has not changed despite many lengthy, candid conversations with Chinese government officials, Wuttke said.""I think these people, they are torn between what they see has to be done, could be done,"" he said. ""Then [there's] a very stern, very clear directive from the top of, this is how it has to be, that's the ideology. And how can you challenge ideology?""Chinese President Xi Jinping said earlier this month that the country has ""continued to respond to Covid-19 and promote economic and social development in a well-coordinated way,"" according to a paraphrase of his remarks shared by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.While Xi said ""China has entered a new development stage,"" he maintained that ""China's door of opening-up and friendly cooperation will always be open to the world,"" according to the release. His remarks came during his first trip abroad since the pandemic began – to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan – during which he met with leaders of several countries in the region.Over the last few years, the Chinese leader has sought to rally the country around the ruling Communist Party and his plans for the ""great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" Xi is set to consolidate his power at a major political meeting next month. Foreign businesses already in China are generally staying put for now.Even if China's economy grows more slowly, its size and the low base ""actually makes a convincing case [for foreign businesses], we're still going to make it,"" Wuttke said.Some, especially German auto giants, are investing more. For the first eight months of the year, foreign direct investment from Germany rose by about 30% from a year earlier — faster than the 23.5% pace recorded for the first seven months, China's Ministry of Commerce said Monday.However, the ministry did not release updated figures for investment from the U.S., which official data showed had grown by about 36% in the first seven months of the year.Foreign businesses can still find specific areas of opportunity.China is improving local market access, albeit in areas where locals already dominate or are ""desperate"" for foreign investment, Wuttke said. ""Otherwise, frankly, I would stop producing this paper."""

""That makes some sense but don't discount that it could be longer because of the uncertainty around Fed policy,"" he said. Lerner pegs the odds of a recession at 50% over the next six to 12 months but says the longer rates stay elevated and competitive, the higher the probability of a recession.  Tighter Fed policy for longer could also impact how long it lasts.

That continues a trend in which policymakers around the world are fighting to control inflation that has spiraled over the last year.To name a few, the Bank of England on Thursday announced a 0.5 percentage point increase ,or 50 basis points, while the Swiss National Bank hiked by 75 basis point. The central banks of the Philippines and Indonesia both rang in with 50 basis point moves of their own, the latter moving twice what analysts had expected.Norway's Norges Bank on Thursday raised half a percentage point, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority matched the Fed with a 75 basis point move. Taiwan hiked by 12.5 basis points, or 0.125 percentage points.Turkey was an exception, approving a rate cut of a full percentage point despite grappling with an 80% inflation rate. The Bank of Japan did not move its rates.The rate moves are in response to inflation that has run rampant around the globe. Contributing factors include weakness in supply chains, the impact that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has had on energy prices, and trillions in stimulus provided by fiscal and monetary authorities.

2022-09-21,"FedEx missed earnings expectations and announced significant cost-cutting in its preliminary earnings report last week.CEO Raj Subramaniam warned of a ""worldwide recession,"" but analysts say FedEx's own shortcomings played a role, too.Analysts say FedEx failed to adapt to changing market conditions. FedEx warned of weakening global shipping demand in a preliminary earnings report last week, leaving the market scrambling to determine whether the problems reflect internal company shortcomings or a broader economic diagnosis.CEO Raj Subramaniam pointed to external factors after the shipping giant missed Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates, telling CNBC's Jim Cramer on ""Mad Money"" that the company is a ""reflection of everybody else's business"" and that he expects a ""worldwide recession."" But some analysts note the relative stability of rivals UPS and DHL, and said FedEx's own failure to adapt also contributed to its performance.""This is the second year in a row now that FedEx has missed its own guidance for its fiscal first quarter, and I think that does create a bit of frustration amongst investors,"" Moody's analyst Jonathan Kanarek said.Kanarek was among the analysts who noted the mix of factors − internal and external − that likely played a role in FedEx's disappointing results. Some experts see FedEx's performance as an overdue confrontation with market realities coming out of the Covid pandemic, which the company previously failed to acknowledge.At its investor day in June, FedEx set out a bullish 2025 outlook driven by annual revenue growth of between 4% and 6% and earnings per share growth of between 14% and 19%. ""Raj came out with a big show back in June, their first analyst day in two years, and talked about an environment that was pretty upbeat. Yet here we are three months later,"" Ken Hoexter, an analyst at Bank of America, told CNBC.""They weren't expecting, nor had built in, an economic downturn,"" Hoexter said.Since around the time of its investor day, Subramaniam said last week that FedEx has seen weekly declines in shipping volumes. It's why the company withdrew its 2023 forecast and announced it would close offices and park planes to slash costs. Its stock fell more than 21%, wiping nearly $11 billion from its market capitalization the day after the report.Still, FedEx stood by its 2025 expectations, a move that Gordon Haskett Research Advisors called ""borderline delusional."" FedEx's competitors, they say, are taking a more realistic approach to the end of the pandemic-era surge in demand.While FedEx reported softness in European demand among its ailments last week, UPS gained market share in the region. In its most recent earnings call, UPS boasted its highest quarterly consolidated operating margin in almost 15 years, citing agility amid difficult macroeconomic conditions.""UPS is two to three years ahead of FedEx in terms of the way they're looking at post Covid margins,"" said Capital Wealth's Kevin Simpson on ""Closing Bell: Overtime."" ""It's almost like FedEx didn't think the environment would ever go back to normal.""As part of its cost-cutting efforts, FedEx said it will reduce some ground operations and defer hiring. Meanwhile, UPS will be hiring more than 100,000 seasonal employees for the holiday period. Analysts note that FedEx's ground and express delivery are nevertheless vulnerable to global economic conditions, and that the disappointing performance of the categories could reflect a recessionary environment.""We really haven't seen evidence of a broad-based slowdown. But obviously FedEx is a bellwether and we don't want to dismiss what they're saying,"" said Moody's Kanarek.Bank of America's Hoexter sees the performance of the express category, which came in $500 million below FedEx's own expectations, as the first indicator of a broader downturn. He said small declines in volume significantly impact margins because air delivery costs so much to maintain.Ground service, which came in $300 million short of the company's forecasts, is the next to feel a slowdown: ""When the consumer stops buying, the stores start seeing shelves filled, you stop replenishing those inventories,"" Hoexter said.Hoexter's biweekly truck shipper survey has reported 11 straight periods in ""recession range"" according to a Bank of America Global Research report. That comes as FedEx reports lower-than-expected business with top clients Target and Walmart, which have both grappled with excess inventory in recent months.FedEx reported strong freight margins, but Hoexter noted that the category is ""more manufacturing-weighted, which hasn't felt as big of a brunt."" If demand continues to slow and manufacturers require less production, Hoexter said FedEx could start to see freight volumes soften, too. Regardless of the factors driving FedEx's troubles, the upcoming holiday season likely won't bring any relief. In a statement, FedEx said the cost-cutting actions it announced last week aren't expected to impact service. ""We are confident in our ability to deliver this holiday season,"" the company said.But retailers are expecting muted holiday sales. And fearing the delays of last year, many had items shipped early. The Port of Los Angeles said that 70% of holiday goods had already hit the shores by the end of August. Inventory gluts that have plagued retailers in recent months may also persist, leading to lighter shipping volumes and further dampening FedEx's business. A KPMG survey found 56% of retail executives expect to be left with excess merchandise after the holidays.FedEx does have some cushioning if troubles persist, S&P's Geoff Wilson notes. The company is sitting on a lot of cash – nearly $7 billion as of May 31 − as opposed to the roughly $3 billion to $4 billion it typically had before the pandemic. He also noted the company reaffirmed its share repurchase plan of about $1.5 billion""This is the best signal management can give about long-term strength at FedEx,"" Wilson said. "
2022-09-21,"The Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point and indicated it will keep hiking well above the current level.The central bank has been looking to bring down inflation, which is running near its highest levels since the early 1980s.Fed officials signaled the intention of continuing to hike until the funds level hits a ""terminal rate,"" or end point, of 4.6% in 2023. That implies a quarter-point rate rise next year but no decreases. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised benchmark interest rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point and indicated it will keep hiking well above the current level.In its quest to bring down inflation running near its highest levels since the early 1980s, the central bank took its federal funds rate up to a range of 3%-3.25%, the highest it has been since early 2008, following the third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move.Stocks seesawed following the announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average most recently down slightly. The market swung as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell discussed the outlook for interest rates and the economy.related investing newsWhat Cramer is looking for from 3 stocks that report earnings next weekPaulina Likosa day agoTraders have been concerned that the Fed is remaining more hawkish for longer than some had anticipated. Projections from the meeting indicated that the Fed expects to raise rates by at least 1.25 percentage points in its two remaining meetings this year. ""My main message has not changed since Jackson Hole,"" Powell said in his post-meeting news conference, referring to his policy speech at the Fed's annual symposium in August in Wyoming. ""The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2%, and we will keep at it until the job is done.""The increases that started in March — and from a point of near-zero — mark the most aggressive Fed tightening since it started using the overnight funds rate as its principal policy tool in 1990. The only comparison was in 1994, when the Fed hiked a total of 2.25 percentage points; it would begin cutting rates by July of the following year.Along with the massive rate increases, Fed officials signaled the intention of continuing to hike until the funds level hits a ""terminal rate,"" or end point, of 4.6% in 2023. That implies a quarter-point rate hike next year but no decreases.The ""dot plot"" of individual members' expectations doesn't point to rate cuts until 2024. Powell and his colleagues have emphasized in recent weeks that it is unlikely rate cuts will happen next year, as the market had been pricing.Federal Open Market Committee members indicate they expect the rate hikes to have consequences. The funds rate on its face addresses the rates that banks charge each other for overnight lending, but it bleeds through to many consumer adjustable-rate debt instruments, such as home equity loans, credit cards and auto financing.In their quarterly updates of estimates for rates and economic data, officials coalesced around expectations for the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4% by next year from its current 3.7%. Increases of that magnitude often are accompanied by recessions.Along with that, they see GDP growth slowing to 0.2% for 2022, rising slightly in the following years to a longer-term rate of just 1.8%. The revised forecast is a sharp cut from the 1.7% estimate in June and comes following two consecutive quarters of negative growth, a commonly accepted definition of recession.Powell conceded a recession is possible, particularly if the Fed has to keep tightening aggressively.""No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession will be,"" he said.The hikes also come with the hopes that headline inflation will drift down to 5.4% this year, as measured by the Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index, which showed inflation at 6.3% in July. The summary of economic projections then sees inflation falling back to the Fed's 2% goal by 2025.Core inflation excluding food and energy is expected to decline to 4.5% this year, little changed from the current 4.6% level, before ultimately falling to 2.1% by 2025. (The PCE reading has been running well below the consumer price index.)The reduction in economic growth came even though the FOMC's statement massaged language that in July had described spending and production as having ""softened."" This meeting's statement noted: ""Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production."" Those were the only changes in a statement that received unanimous approval.Otherwise, the statement continued to describe job gains as ""robust"" and noted that ""inflation remains elevated."" It also repeated that ""ongoing increases in the target rate will be appropriate."" The dot plot showed virtually all members on board with the higher rates in the near term, though there were some variations in subsequent years. Six of the 19 ""dots"" were in favor of taking rates to a 4.75%-5% range next year, but the central tendency was to 4.6%, which would put rates in the 4.5%-4.75% area. The Fed targets its fund rate in quarter-point ranges.The chart indicated as many as three rate cuts in 2024 and four more in 2025, to take the longer-run funds rate down to a median outlook of 2.9%.Markets have been bracing for a more aggressive Fed.""I believe 75 is the new 25 until something breaks, and nothing has broken yet,"" said Bill Zox, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in reference to the size of the rate hikes. ""The Fed is not anywhere close to a pause or a pivot. They are laser-focused on breaking inflation. A key question is what else might they break.""Traders had fully priced in the 0.75 percentage point move and even had assigned an 18% chance of a full percentage point hike, according to CME Group data. Futures contracts just before Wednesday's meeting implied a 4.545% funds rate by April 2023.The moves come amid stubbornly high inflation that Powell and his colleagues spent much of last year dismissing as ""transitory."" Officials relented in March of this year, with a quarter-point rise that was the first increase since taking rates to zero in the early days of the Covid pandemic.Along with the rate increases, the Fed has been reducing the amount of bond holdings it has accumulated over the years. September marked the beginning of full-speed ""quantitative tightening,"" as it is known in markets, with up to $95 billion a month in proceeds from maturing bonds being allowed to roll off the Fed's $8.9 trillion balance sheet."

With lingering high inflation, stock market volatility and recession fears, it's easy to see why some Americans might trim charitable giving.But some donors may be eyeing bigger gifts for 2022 because of that economic uncertainty, according to a study from Fidelity Charitable, a nonprofit enabling investors to give through a so-called donor-advised fund, a charitable investment account.Nearly 75% of those surveyed said they worry about other community members, and 64% are concerned about nonprofits amid threats of a recession. As a result, 59% of donors may be willing to give more this year, according to the survey, which polled 969 of the nonprofit's donors in July and August.More from Personal Finance:The best time to apply for college financial aid is coming upWhat the Fed's third 75 basis point interest rate hikes mean for youBenchmark bond yields are 'bad news' for investors as the Fed hikes ratesIndividual Americans donated an estimated $326.87 billion to charity in 2021, a 4.9% rise compared to the prior year, according to Giving USA.While the organization predicted ""a robust year"" for giving in 2022, it also emphasized the link between philanthropy and the strength of the stock market. The report came out as the stock market approached record highs in December, but the S&P 500 has dropped more than 20% year-to-date. While some donors may be unsure about 2022, it may be an easier choice if you already have money in a donor-advised fund, allowing an upfront donation and the option to pick recipients over time, said certified financial planner David Foster, founder of Gateway Wealth Management in St. Louis. A donor-advised fund is a charitable account for future gifts.""You've already made that decision,"" he said. ""Now it's just a matter of doing it a little quicker.""Indeed, 67% of donors said they have given more to charity than they would have without a donor-advised fund, the Fidelity Charity study shows, and 57% have used their account to ""respond to an emergency or disaster situation."" However, if someone didn't transfer money upfront, new donations for 2022 may be smaller than previous years due to less income or lower account balances. ""From my experience, people are still giving roughly the same percentage of either their income or their wealth,"" said Foster. ""It's just that their incomes and wealth are down because of the economy.""""There's just less wealth to give,"" he added.While donor-advised funds are a popular option, older investors may also consider so-called qualified charitable distributions, or QCDs. These are direct gifts from an IRA to an eligible charity. If you're age 70½ or older, you may donate up to $100,000 per year, and it may count as a required minimum distribution once you turn 72.  ""There are relatively few circumstances where that would not be the first source of giving if you're over 70½,"" Foster said.Although QCDs don't provide a charitable deduction, the transfer won't count as part of your adjusted gross income, which can trigger higher Medicare Part B and Part D premiums."
2022-09-22,"U.K. inflation was 9.9% in August, well ahead of the BOE's 2% target.Higher rates come as the U.K. faces a falling pound, recession forecasts and a set of economic reforms under new Prime Minister Liz Truss. LONDON — The Bank of England voted to raise its base rate to 2.25% from 1.75% on Thursday, lower than the 0.75 percentage point increase that had been expected by many traders.Inflation in the U.K. dipped slightly in August but at 9.9% year-on-year remained well above the bank's 2% target. Energy and food have seen the biggest price rises, but core inflation, which strips out those components, is still at 6.3% on an annual basis. The BOE now expects inflation to peak at just under 11% in October, down from a previous forecast of 13%.The hike was in line with economists' forecasts, according to Reuters, however many in the market had been expecting a 75-basis-point raise, in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve and many other major central banks. It came as the Bank of England said it believed the U.K. economy was already in a recession, as it forecast GDP would contract by 0.1% in the third quarter, down from a previous forecast of 0.4% growth. It would follow a 0.1% decline in the second quarter.Numerous analysts, along with business association the British Chambers of Commerce, have previously said they expect the U.K. to enter a recession before the end of the year. As well as energy price shocks, it faces trade bottlenecks due to Covid-19 and Brexit, declining consumer sentiment, and falling retail sales.The BOE dropped its key rate, known as the bank rate, down to 0.1% in March 2020 in an attempt to prop up growth and spending at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, as inflation began to rise sharply late last year, it was among the first major central banks to kick off a hiking cycle at its December meeting.  This is its seventh consecutive rise and takes U.K. interest rates to a level last seen in 2008.In a release explaining its decision, the bank noted volatility in wholesale gas prices but said announcements of government caps on energy bills would limit further increases in consumer price index inflation. However, it said there had been more signs since August of ""continuing strength in domestically generated inflation.""It added: ""The labour market is tight and domestic cost and price pressures remain elevated. While the [energy bill subsidy] reduces inflation in the near term, it also means that household spending is likely to be less weak than projected in the August Report over the first two years of the forecast period.""

It has fallen precipitously against the greenback this year and was last at this level in 1985. It was up 0.2% after the BOE decision with the 0.5 percentage point rise fully priced in. Loading chart... The devaluation of the pound has been caused by a combination of strength in the dollar — as traders flock to the perceived safe haven investment amid global market volatility and as the U.S. Federal Reserve hikes its own interest rates — and grim forecasts for the U.K. economy.  Meanwhile, the country's newly formed government has set out numerous significant economic policy proposals this month ahead of a ""fiscal event,"" dubbed a mini-budget, when they will be officially announced on Friday.This is expected to include a reversal of the recent rise in the National Insurance tax, cuts in levies for businesses and homebuyers, and a plan for ""investment zones"" with low taxes.Truss has repeatedly stressed a commitment to lowering taxes in a bid to boost economic growth.However, the energy crisis has also meant the government has announced a huge spending package to curb soaring bills for households and businesses.Data published Wednesday showed the U.K. government borrowed £11.8 billion ($13.3 billion) last month, nearly twice as much as forecast and £6.5 billion more than the same month in 2019, due to a rise in government spending. David Bharier, head of research at business group the British Chambers of Commerce, said the bank faced a ""tricky balancing act"" in using the blunt instrument of rate rises to control inflation.""The bank's decision to raise rates will increase the risk for individuals and organisations exposed to debt burdens and rising mortgage costs – dampening consumer confidence,"" he said in a note.""Recent energy price cap announcements will have provided some comfort to businesses and households alike and should place downward pressure on the rate of inflation.""""The bank, looking to dampen consumer demand, and government, looking to increase growth, could now be pulling in opposite directions,"" he added, saying the coming economic statement from the finance minister Friday was a ""critical moment.""Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the bank was hiking at a ""sensible pace"" given the lower inflation outlook and emerging slack in the economy.Tombs forecast a 50 basis point increase at the bank's November meeting, with risks titled toward a 75 basis point hike given the hawkishness of three committee members. He said this was likely to be followed by a 25 basis point rise in December, taking the bank rate to 3% at the end of the year, with no further hikes next year.The U.K. is not alone in raising interest rates to combat inflation. The European Central Bank raised rates by 75 basis points earlier this month, while Switzerland's central bank hiked by 75 basis points Thursday morning. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its benchmark rate range by the same amount Wednesday."

Both the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen also fell heavily as the two economies maintain more accommodative monetary policies than the U.S.  ""No central banker today — hardly any — talks about stable currencies. It's about depressing the economy to fight inflation,"" Forbes said at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in Singapore on Monday. Forbes, a Republican who ran for president twice calling for flat income taxes, said many economists and policymakers have stuck to a standard ""dogma"" or mindset of targeting inflation by hiking interest rates and failed to look beyond that, such as by taking steps to shore up currencies.   Forbes cited favorably an example from the 1980s: After then Fed Chair Paul Volcker reined in inflation with a dramatic interest rate hike of more than 20%, U.S. President Ronald Reagan stabilized the economy and increased production by cutting taxes and introducing deregulation. The Reagan administration also coordinated global efforts to sell dollars and buy up other currencies. ""Today, unfortunately, not only is the Biden administration putting up obstacles to deal with supply-side problems, but also the Federal Reserve and other central banks think you have to depress the economy to bring inflation down,"" he said, disputing the idea that a recession is the only solution to combating inflation. ""They do it by artificially raising interest rates. So they have fewer people employed ... that is not the real cure,"" he said.""The real cure is to stabilize the currency. You don't have to make people poor to conquer inflation.""Currency imbalances can create problems for economies. A higher U.S. dollar means more expensive exports, while weaker currencies could mean problems like lower foreign exchange reserves. Forbes suggested using gold to stabilize currencies — for example, tying the U.S. dollar to gold so the dollar has a fixed value. ""Gold holds its intrinsic value better than anything else on earth … gold is not perfect as a stable value but it is better than anything we have found in over 4,000 years,"" he said. ""With unstable currencies you get less productive long-term investments, which is key to economic growth.""Forbes said that after the Bretton Woods gold standard was introduced in the 1940s — under which the U.S. dollar was fixed to gold and other currencies were fixed to the dollar — economic growth rates were a lot higher.  Stock picks and investing trends from CNBC Pro:JPMorgan's massively popular income ETF is getting beat by its own sister fundBank of America analysts are bullish on these top 10 unloved global stocksBitcoin just posted its worst week of the year.

2022-09-26,"Siegel said the Fed is ""talking way too tough"" and should be more worried about causing a recession than lagged inflation data.""Honestly, I think Chairman Powell should offer the American people an apology for such poor monetary policy that he has pursued, and the Fed has pursued, over the past few years,"" Siegel said.The comments come after another 0.75 percentage point hike from the Fed last week, which brought the central bank's target range for its benchmark interest rate to 3%-3.25%. Wharton Business School professor Jeremy Siegel criticized the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell, on Monday, saying the U.S. central bank is moving too aggressively to fight inflation and will hurt American workers in the process.Siegel said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that persistently high inflation in 2022 is due in large part to mistakes made by the Fed in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, which caused economic shutdowns around the world and big drops in global markets, and that the Fed's pivot to fast rate hikes would cause more economic damage.""Honestly, I think Chairman Powell should offer the American people an apology for such poor monetary policy that he has pursued, and the Fed has pursued, over the past few years,"" Siegel said. The comments come after another 0.75 percentage point hike from the Fed last week, which brought the central bank's target range for its benchmark interest rate to 3%-3.25%. Projections from Fed policymakers at the recent meeting showed that the rate could jump well above 4% in coming months.Siegel said the Fed is ""talking way too tough"" and should be more worried about causing a recession than focusing on lagged inflation data. He also said the Fed is being inconsistent with how it uses some pieces of economic data.""Chairman Powell talked quite a bit about JOLTS data — the job opening and labor turnover data. How tight it is. ... Interesting thing, I look back a year ago September, it was exactly as tight as it is today. And he never said anything about inflation. What's caused him to change his mind? It's the same data,"" Siegel said.Inflation has been running at its fastest pace since the early 1980s for much of this year. Some of the price increases were due to factors like supply chain issues from Covid and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which drove up the price of commodities. But inflation appeared to be broadening out in recent reports, even as the price of oil has declined sharply.One source of inflation that worries some economists and policymakers now is the threat from rising wages, which can create a so-called wage-price spiral, where higher prices push up wages, which then reinforce still higher prices.However, Siegel said he doesn't think wages are really driving inflation this time, saying that recent worker raises appear to be ""catch-up"" rather than a cause.""It seems to me wrong for Powell to say we're going to crush wage increases, we're going to crush the worker, when that is not the cause of the inflation. The cause of the inflation was excessive monetary accommodation for the last two years,"" Siegel said."
2022-09-26,"The OECD projected euro zone economic growth would slow from 3.1% this year to only 0.3% in 2023.Despite the fast deteriorating outlook for major economies, the OECD said further rate hikes were needed to fight inflation, forecasting most major central banks' policy rates would top 4% next year. Global economic growth is slowing more than was forecast a few months ago in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as energy and inflation crises risk snowballing into recessions in major economies, the OECD said on Monday.While global growth this year was still expected at 3.0%, it is now projected to slow to 2.2% in 2023, revised down from a forecast in June of 2.8%, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.The Paris-based policy forum was particularly pessimistic about the outlook in Europe - the most directly exposed economy to the fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine.Global output next year is now projected to be $2.8 trillion lower than what the OECD forecast before Russia attacked Ukraine - a loss of income worldwide equivalent in size to the French economy.""The global economy has lost momentum in the wake of Russia's unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. GDP growth has stalled in many economies and economic indicators point to an extended slowdown,"" OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement.The OECD projected euro zone economic growth would slow from 3.1% this year to only 0.3% in 2023, which implies the 19-nation shared currency bloc would spend at least part of the year in a recession, defined as two straight quarters of contraction.That marked a dramatic downgrade from the OECD's last economic outlook in June, when it had forecast the euro zone's economy would grow 1.6% next year. The OECD was particularly gloomy about Germany's Russian-gas dependent economy, forecasting it would contract 0.7% next year, slashed from a June estimate for 1.7% growth.The OECD warned that further disruptions to energy supplies would hit growth and boost inflation, especially in Europe where they could knock activity back another 1.25 percentage points and boost inflation by 1.5 percentage points, pushing many countries into recession for the full year of 2023.Though far less dependent on imported energy than Europe, the United States was seen skidding into a downturn as the U.S. Federal Reserve jacks up interest rates to get a handle on inflation. The OECD forecast that the world's biggest economy would slow from 1.5% growth this year to only 0.5% next year, down from June forecasts for 2.5% in 2022 and 1.2% in 2023.Meanwhile, China's strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19 this year meant that its economy was set to grow only 3.2% this year and 4.7% next year, whereas the OECD had previously expected 4.4% in 2022 and 4.9% in 2023.Despite the fast deteriorating outlook for major economies, the OECD said further rate hikes were needed to fight inflation, forecasting most major central banks' policy rates would top 4% next year.With many governments increasing support packages to help households and businesses cope with high inflation, the OECD said such measures should target those most in need and be temporary to keep down their cost and not further burden high post-COVID debts."
2022-09-27,"Asian business leaders say consumers should be prepared for prices to remain high for longer, even as central banks globally raise interest rates in efforts to fight inflation.A number of structural changes in the global economy could keep driving up costs, such as deglobalization, decarbonization and U.S.-China tensions.Compared with this ""new normal,"" executives said the previous cycle defined by zero interest rates and persistently low inflation was ""abnormal."" Inflation in consumer goods will persist as a ""new normal"" as the global economy undergoes structural changes, Asian business leaders warn.While rising interest rates might eventually temper asset prices, deglobalization and decarbonization could continue to drive up costs for everyday goods, said V. Shankar, chief executive of emerging markets investment manager Gateway Partners. ""Inflation is here to stay come hell or high water, irrespective of what the central banks do because there are some structural, intractable problems that have led to higher prices,"" Shankar said Monday at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in Singapore.""Despite helicopter money and zero interest rates, the reason why the price of goods stayed down for so long is because of a vast efficient manufacturing agent called China, and the integration of global supply chains.""That integration paved the way for cheaper goods. But now, catalyzed by the pandemic, there are new threats to interwoven global supply chains as countries look to bring back manufacturing to their own countries or to countries they are friendly with, Shankar said.In July, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen touted the need to boost supply chain resilience through ""friend-shoring"" — doing business with countries that share values with Washington.This collapses globalization and increases prices as manufacturing will no longer be based on numbers and cost considerations, Shankar added. Decarbonization efforts will also contribute to higher prices, Shankar said, as there is not enough supply of components for climate-friendly goods to meet demand.For instance, the global production and consumption of graphite for electric vehicle batteries was 1 million tonnes last year but in 10 years, that could rise to 5 million tonnes. There is no indication where that extra production will come from, Shankar says.  ""If you look at the fossil fuel industry, they are investing at a pace as if we are transitioning to a net-zero economy by 2035 whereas the renewable industry is investing at a pace of roughly a third of what is required for net-zero by 2050,"" he said. ""There is an inevitable train wreck and the politics and societal pressures are colliding with economics. So, inflation is here to stay.""Ho Kwon Ping, executive chairman of Singapore's multinational hospitality group Banyan Tree Holdings agreed, saying higher interest rates are not the new normal, rather, zero or low interest rates were ""abnormal."" ""I think a real abnormal situation was the period we went through where central banks and others perhaps now, in retrospect, reacted too strongly and we had too long a period of zero or even negative interest rates,"" Ho said. ""The world is going, in my view, back to probably a long-term situation of low interest rates, and hopefully, low inflation, but zero inflation, zero interest rates, that's the abnormality, and not the future that we're looking at."" Whether it is deglobalization or decarbonization, underscoring these concerns is the growing rivalry between the U.S. and China, the potential splintering of global trade and business into two blocs, and having to take sides.Ho said many business leaders in Asia-Pacific and other parts of the world have had to start ""scenario planning"" to mitigate potential sanctions on China. Even China itself is preparing to be self-sufficient in key areas such as securing enough energy, food and critical goods supplies, Ho adds. ""What I think is really strange is this very aggressive, decoupling between China and the rest of the world, from each other,"" Ho said.  ""For those of us who have operations in over 20 countries, I'm just having a hard time trying to figure out where I'm going to be getting pressure from — in order not to do business with certain countries or to do business with certain companies. And to be caught in this situation. I think it's very uncomfortable."" The world's business leaders may have to abandon ""the luxury of thinking"" that the U.S. and China will get back together, Ho said.Chairul Tanjung, chairman of CT Corp, one of Indonesia's largest conglomerates, urged countries to consider a new framework of working better together. ""Now, everybody, every country strives to solve their own problem, trying to 'win' the situation,"" Tanjung said.He added that a crucial way to move forward is to focus on critical global issues such as climate change."

Yields on U.K. government bonds have rocketed following the government's budget — meaning their prices have fallen drastically (bond yields move inversely to prices). LONDON — A so-called ""mini-budget"" by the U.K.'s new government Friday has sparked a level of market volatility not seen in the country since the Covid-19 crash or the 2008 financial crisis.A package of tax cuts expected to total £45 billion in the coming years, combined with a massive spending increase to help households and businesses deal with higher energy bills, left investors nervous about the U.K.'s future as it takes on higher levels of debt. That was despite Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng's target of a 2.5% growth trend and pledge to release a plan to reduce debt as a percentage of GDP in the medium term.It comes as inflation remains at 9.9% and the country has likely already entered a recession.Here was some of the fallout: Loading chart... Sterling's response to the government's announcement was near-immediate and extreme.The pound lost nearly 3.6% against the dollar Friday and continued to fall Monday when the market reopened. It hit an all-time low below $1.04 early Monday morning in London.It has since recovered slightly, trading around $1.08 at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, but remains at what was — until last week — a 37-year low. It has fallen from $1.35 at the start of the year. Loading chart... While some supporters of the government's plan have pointed to the dollar's bull run this year as the cause of sterling's slide, the pound also fell against the euro.The euro is currently trading around £0.89 — up from £0.84 at the start of the year — despite the euro zone facing its own significant challenges, ranging from an energy crisis to growing recession risks.

A key question now is whether the Bank of England, which has already raised interest rates from 0.1% to 2.25% over the last nine months, will be pushed into faster and higher rate rises.On Monday, Governor Andrew Bailey said the bank would ""not hesitate to change interest rates as necessary."" However, he said a decision would be made at its next scheduled meeting in November, playing down speculation of an emergency rate hike or intervention to prop up the pound.The U.K. overnight indexed swap market now points to an 80% chance of a hike to 3.5% by Nov. 3, which would be a 125 basis points rise, and a 20% chance of an even higher hike to 3.75%."

A majority of CFOs (57%) said that they do not think inflation has peaked. More than a quarter of the CFOs say inflation is the biggest external risk factor facing their businesses. That is down from 40% who cited inflation last quarter, as concerns about consumer demand in the softening economy rise among CFOs, and more now cite it as their No. 1 risk.The CNBC CFO Council survey is a sample of the current outlook among top financial officers. It was conducted among 21 chief financial officers at major organizations between September 12-27.

Nineteen percent of CFOs now say they expect a recession in the fourth quarter of this year, up from 13% in Q2. Furthermore, another 19% of the CFOs said that the U.S. economy is in a recession now.Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told CNBC's Ylan Mui at Delivering Alpha that the Biden administration is doing everything it can to combat inflation in order to avoid a recession.""Consumer confidence is still high.

The union movement that kicked off across the country more than a year ago has continued its momentum in 2022, with workers in warehouses, coffee shops, grocery stores and airlines pushing for representation.Working conditions during the pandemic pushed many of these frontline workers to organize, but fears about the economy and a potential recession could stand to curb the union boom if the job market shifts.Unions can help workers secure better pay, schedules and job security through contract agreements, but some organizers claim their employers retaliate against them and endanger their livelihoods.Workers like Robert ""Rab"" Bradlea, 32, are willing to take on this risk, despite recession talk. Bradlea scaled back his hours at Trader Joe's Wine Store in New York City and picked up a second job as he and some of his coworkers sought to unionize. Bradlea said the move to organize under the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union had the support of most of his coworkers. Some opposed joining a union, either because of previous experience or fear of losing their jobs. But Bradley thought only he and his fellow organizers were putting themselves at risk.""I thought they would look for 'bad apples' and weed out organizers specifically, rather than torch an entire store,"" Bradlea said.Instead, before the beloved wine store could even file a petition for a union election, Trader Joe's abruptly closed the location on Aug. 11, telling employees that same day. Trader Joe's spokesperson Nakia Rohde said in a statement to CNBC that the grocer opted to close the ""underperforming"" store to support its Union Square grocery store using the wine shop's space ahead of the holiday season. So far, this year has proved to be a success for the labor movement. Union petitions from Oct. 1 through June 30 were up 58% over the prior year, to 1,892, according to the National Labor Relations Board.By May of this year, petitions for the year had exceeded the total number of filings in all of last year. The NLRB has yet to release full year data, but a CNBC analysis of filings shows nearly 900 more petitions in fiscal year 2022 over last year's numbers.This comes at a time when public approval of labor unions continues to climb. Recent Gallup data show  71% of Americans now approve of labor unions, up from 68% last year and 64% pre-pandemic. The measure is at its highest level on record since 1965.The job market, particularly for retail trade, accommodation, food services and transportation and warehousing workers, is still favoring employees, with a combined 1 million more job openings today in those three sectors compared with pre-pandemic levels.  ""Right now in the retail space, we have so many more jobs than we do workers, and that puts disproportionate power in our hands right now because the company needs them almost as much as we need them,"" said Hannah Smith, an employee at the recently unionized REI store in Berkeley, California.REI did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.The shift in the balance of power has led some employers to hike pay and enhance other benefits. For example, Amazon said on Wednesday that it's hiking average hourly pay from $18 to more than $19 for warehouse and delivery workers. The announcement comes ahead of its annual Prime Day promotion and a busy holiday season, as well as a union election in Albany next month.As the Federal Reserve continues to aggressively raise interest rates to fight inflation and cool down the economy, market watchers, economists and executives are warning of a potential recession in 2023. If the economy cools off, the union movement may follow suit, according to Catherine Creighton, director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations branch in Buffalo. But it seems unlikely in the short term.""I think it will certainly make it more difficult if we do have a recession, where it's harder for employees to find other employment, they [may] be less likely to take the risk of unionization,"" Creighton said. ""I don't see that we are in that position at this point, because employers are still having a really hard time filling jobs, the baby boomers have retired and all evidence points to the fact that the labor market is going to be favorable to employees in the near future.""For now, advocates believe the momentum will be hard to slow down. Whether it's petitions or other wins, like a California law that creates a council to govern the fast-food industry labor conditions, 2022 has been a banner year for organizing.""I think it's the collective action that you're seeing that isn't going to get stopped by whatever the recessionary forces are, because working people have walked through fire during this pandemic, showed up every day to work, in many cases risk their lives,"" said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union. ""And they're ready to expect more in their work life and demand dignity and respect on the job."" Some employees say interest in organizing has fallen somewhat as their employers appear to fight back, using tactics like shuttering stores, firing organizers and offering tantalizing benefits to non-union shops only.At Starbucks, for example, the number of union petitions fell every month from March through August. There was a slight uptick in September with 10 petitions filed so far, according to the NLRB.  Since interim CEO Howard Schultz returned to the company in April, Starbucks has adopted a more aggressive strategy to oppose the union push and invest in its workers.In May, the company announced enhanced pay hikes for non-unionized stores and extra training for baristas that went into effect in August after holding feedback sessions with its employees. The union has said the coffee giant is illegally withholding the benefits from cafes, but Starbucks maintains it cannot offer new benefits without negotiations for union shops. Legal experts predict the benefits battle will wind up before the NLRB.""Our focus is on working directly with our partners to reimagine the future of Starbucks. We respect our partners rights to organize but believe that working directly together – without a 3rd party – is the best way to elevate the partner experience at Starbucks,"" Starbucks spokesperson Reggie Borges told CNBC.Tyler Keeling works as barista trainer at a Starbucks in Lakewood, California, which has voted to unionize, and also is organizing other stores with Starbucks Workers United. He said the additional benefits not being offered to unionized stores has both intimidated and motivated people, and that better pay is important in this economic climate.""People are seeing that Starbucks is willing to kind of mess with their livelihood to prevent this union, and that scares people. But at the end of the day, as far as it is driving people to not organize, it's also driving people to organize,"" Keeling said.He added that he believes once the union makes continued progress on having fired workers reinstated and is successful in having benefits extended to union stores, there will be more headway made on petitions.And stores are still pushing for more despite the threat of a looming recession. Billie Adeosun, Starbucks barista and organizer in Olympia, Washington, said unionizing is a ""big risk,"" claiming losing your job is a ""real possibility,"" but the prospect of successful contract negotiations with better pay and benefits is a motivator.""Most of us make $15 to $18 an hour and none of us are working 40 hours a week, and that's just not a living wage,"" Adeosun said. ""A lot of us have to get a second job or rely on government assistance to pay our bills, so yeah, we are terrified to be doing this work in spite of the economy and the fact that it is just falling apart right in front of us.""About 240 locations out of its 9,000 company-owned cafes have voted to unionize as of Sept. 22, according to the National Labor Relations Board. But contract negotiations could help or hinder the push to unionize the nation's largest coffee chain. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said signs of progress on a contract between the union and Starbucks could be one catalyst to reaccelerate organizing. On the other hand, if they don't reach an agreement, workers can vote to decertify the union after a year.So far, Starbucks has only begun negotiating with three stores, two in New York and one in Arizona. But the company said Monday that it sent letters to 238 cafes offering a three-week window in October to start negotiations.And despite the petition slowdown at Starbucks, organizers' success has inspired workers elsewhere, like Bradlea, the Trader Joe's employee.""Their stores are about the same number people as the Trader Joe's wine store. This is doable, and they're succeeding at it,"" he said. Even with talk of a potential recession, some workers say they're undeterred, given the competitive job market. Brandi McNease, organizer at a now-closed location of Chipotle Mexican Grill in Augusta, Maine, said the decision to petition was driven by the power workers have and the current economic climate.""We looked around at the endless now-hiring signs plastered on every fast food drive-through menu and decided that we could just quit and take another job or we could fight, and if we lost, still take another job,"" McNease told CNBC in an email.The store was the first to file for a union election at the burrito chain, and the company said the location was permanently closed due to staffing challenges, not the union petition.  Workers called the move retaliatory and have filed multiple unfair labor practice charges against the company with the NLRB, McNease said.Chipotle declined to comment.Some workers say the last recession has informed the need for better worker protections today, and now is the time to push.""I had coworkers who lived through the 2008 recession and had a really tough time finding jobs then,"" said Smith, the REI employee in California. ""Creating a union now, it felt like a way to protect for that in the future."""

Euro zone unemployment came in at 6.6% in August, unchanged from July and showing evidence that the labor market has remained resilient despite the impending recession and energy crisis sweeping the continent.""With labor markets still tight and inflation gradually becoming more entrenched in the Euro area economy, today's numbers will only embolden the ECB to focus solely on inflation, giving them a green light to introduce another sizeable policy rate hike - even as the economy rushes headlong into a tough winter and recession,"" Shah said.""The Euro area faces a particularly difficult dilemma.

2022-10-03,"The Treasury Department's Financial Stability Oversight Council released a new report on digital assets Monday.The report outlined several recommendations to keep cryptocurrency and digital assets trading from destabilizing U.S. financial security.The council pushed for legislation providing for tighter oversight of crypto. The Treasury Department warned Monday that unregulated cryptocurrencies could pose a risk to the U.S. financial system.The warning was a part of the first major public report released by the Treasury's Financial Stability Oversight Council on digital assets. The council identified digital or ""crypto"" assets such as stablecoins as well as lending and borrowing on the industry's trading platforms as an ""important emerging vulnerability."" ""The report concludes that crypto-asset activities could pose risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system and emphasizes the importance of appropriate regulation, including enforcement of existing laws,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. ""It is vital that government stakeholders collectively work to make progress on these recommendations.""The council first designated digital assets a priority area in February.  Global crypto-asset market capitalization reached a peak of roughly $3 trillion last November, comprising approximately 1% of global financial assets, according to the report. Though the impact is relatively small in the larger global financial system, digital financing is quickly gaining in popularity and is being manipulated by criminals for illegal gain, according to the report.Earlier this year, the Treasury Department issued a series of sanctions against Russian oligarchs, certain Russian banks and other organizations for using crypto assets to evade sanctions. In September, the agency blocked all property in possession or control of U.S. persons for 22 individuals and two entities that helped digitally finance Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency popular on the foreign exchange market, are also overwhelmingly used in speculative crypto-asset trading, Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said during a Monday FSOC meeting. Created for price stability, the price of the stablecoin is linked to flat currencies, commodities or other crypto assets. The group recommended legislation that empowers financial regulators to more vigorously oversee the industry as well as expanding bank exams to require federal and state agencies to look at services provided by crypto asset service companies.Formed after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, FSOC identifies emerging threats to the country's financial security and organizes a coordinated response across U.S. financial regulators. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FSOC is authorized to supervise and regulate nonbank financial companies, financial market utilities and payment, clearing or settlement activities to address possible vulnerabilities to financial stability.The report states that, to date, the FSOC has not used this authority to regulate the cryptocurrency market."
2022-10-03,"The U.K. economy has been gripped by market mayhem for the last week.The British pound plummeted, the value of government bonds crashed and the Bank of England intervened with an emergency plan to stabilize financial markets.This chaos can be traced back to Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng announcing a ""mini-budget"" on Sept. 23. His plan includes widespread tax cuts, fewer rules and regulations for businesses and the removal of a cap on bonuses for bankers.At a time when millions are grappling with rising prices and a cost-of-living crisis, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that the new policies ""will likely increase inequality.""Criticism and uncertainty have been widespread, especially among young people. Google searches like ""do the tax cuts help me"" skyrocketed, while outrage was rife on social media.So, what does it all mean for young Brits? How does the budget and resulting economic chaos impact income, first-time homeowners and student loans?CNBC Make It spoke to three personal finance analysts to find out. The majority of the budget focuses on tax cuts. The basic income tax rate will drop by 1 pence ($0.01), which will ""help a little,"" says Chieu Cao, CEO of financial wellbeing platform Mintago.""Someone earning £25,000 a year will save £124.30 annually, while those on £35,000 will save £224.30,"" he added.Similarly, the reversal of the recent National Insurance (tax on earnings) bump by 1.25% will have a small impact and boost employees' paychecks.""Someone earning £30,000 a year will save £218 when the NI rate comes back down,"" Cao says. ""But, in a high-inflation environment, these savings will do little to account for the rising cost of living."" In addition to the usual taxes, many recent graduates are worried about what the budget will mean for them. Student loan repayments are not directly impacted by the so-called mini-budget, and the government has capped interest rates on them for now. At first glance, the budget only addresses a small part of the housing market: a reduction of stamp duty, a tax paid by many buyers when purchasing a property. However, first-time buyers only have to pay the tax if their new home is worth more than the average U.K. property.The majority of first-time buyers fall below this threshold and therefore won't benefit from the cuts, Jobson said.""The change mainly benefits high-earning first-time buyers and those with sufficient backing from the bank of mum and dad,"" he added.Indeed, Jobson said the mini-budget may have made buying a house even more difficult. ""The fall in the value of the pound following the mini-budget resulted in violent movements in the money market that has seen lenders pull competitive home loans in anticipation of further interest rate rises. This has pushed many wannabe homeowners to the sidelines,"" he explained.Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, adds that this is also likely to impact those who aren't yet looking to buy and plan to keep renting their homes.""Landlords with mortgages are likely to see their monthly mortgage payments rise significantly … There's every chance they will pass the extra costs through into higher rents in order to make property rental add up for them.""  The mini-budget itself hardly impacts saving and investing — two themes that young people are constantly advised to prioritize. The economic impact of the new policies in terms of creating uncertainty around interest rate hikes, inflation and recession, however, could make a difference.""Interest rates are rising, which would typically help young people with investments and savings – it ought to ensure they achieve better returns. However, interest rates are still dwarfed by inflation for the most part, which means money left in savings accounts is likely to be losing money in real terms; the price of everything else is increasing faster than the size of their savings pots,"" Cao said.For investors, the recent market turbulence might not be all bad news, Coles said. ""There has been an initial reaction to the turmoil but over time the impact will depend on what you hold and where those companies make their money,"" she said.""This doesn't necessarily mean you should do anything different with your investments. If you have a sensible diverse portfolio then it's important not to panic because investing is a long-term business,"" Coles said."
2022-10-03,"Rate hike expectations on the Bank of England, which next meets Nov. 3, rose sharply after the budget announcement on Sep. 23.The tax cut, which Prime Minister Liz Truss was defending just hours before, would have abolished a 45% rate paid on annual income over £150,000 ($166,770).The U.K. Treasury had previously confirmed the tax cut would lead to an average £10,000 saving for 660,000 people. LONDON — The U.K. government's reversal on scrapping the top rate of income tax is down to political optics and will not reassure market skittishness over its economic plan, analysts told CNBC Monday.The tax cut, which Prime Minister Liz Truss was defending just hours before, would have abolished a 45% rate paid on annual income over £150,000 ($166,770).Paul Dales, chief U.K. economist at Capital Economics, said it would have a limited impact on revenue.""Of the £44 billion net loosening in fiscal policy by 2026/27 the Chancellor announced in the mini-budget, the 45p tax cut accounted for just £2 billion.

Rate hike expectations on the Bank of England, which next meets Nov. 3, rose sharply after the budget announcement on Sep. 23, with the pound falling in value and the gilt market experiencing a historic sell-off.""The greatest part of the borrowing that came from the 23 September mini-budget is still unfunded,"" Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""It includes what is expected to be a package worth more than £100 billion over the next two years to support businesses and households with energy bills.Despite speculation that the government will be looking at what else it might cut, its decisions may not be easy or popular, Foley said. Meanwhile, the Bank of England's emergency asset-buying program, which has supported markets over the last week, would eventually end.Kwarteng said Monday at the Conservative Party conference it would be looking to cut £18 billion in public services. He will deliver his main speech Monday afternoon.Foley said: ""If the markets don't believe in the credibility of the government's policy, gilts are still going to be very exposed and so is sterling. So, far from out of the woods, I would say.""Sterling got a slight boost from the government's tax cut pivot and was 0.3% higher against the dollar at $1.12 at 11:40 a.m. London time Monday.

Instead, the Fed should move slower and look more closely at economic data, he said.related investing newsWhat Cramer is looking for from 3 stocks that report earnings next weekPaulina Likosa day agoThe Federal Reserve has so far this year delivered three straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hikes to quell high inflation. In addition, at its latest meeting it signaled that at least one more 0.75 percentage point rate increase is in the cards this year. To date, the Fed has hiked rates a total of 3 percentage points.He noted that the Fed's actions, which have boosted the U.S. dollar, are already scrambling global currency markets. Many currencies including the yen, euro and pound have lost value against the dollar. These changes can put a wrench in global trade.Sternlicht also sees the Fed as misunderstanding the cause of high inflation, which is from massive financial stimulus packages that went out as economies were reopening from coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.""Now that we're building momentum and people are getting employed and wages are rising, they want to stomp on the whole thing and end the party,"" he said. But, too much action probably isn't necessary – while U.S. consumers are still spending, it's inevitable that they will slow purchases as stimulus money runs out. Data is already showing this in some areas – car purchases have slipped, as have housing sales, as rates increase. In addition, the $36 trillion rout in the stock market this year has also slowed purchasing power.If the Fed continues to tighten, businesses will put off hiring and investment decisions, capital spending will slow and tech stocks – which have already been hit by higher interest rates – will continue to struggle, he said.""The Fed has to stop and just look at the data,"" Sternlicht said, adding that the central bank needs to focus on the real economy. ""The equity market and the bond market move overnight on the Fed but the real economy takes time.""He said if the war in Ukraine resolves more quickly than expected that will be a positive for the global economy as will China's eventual reopening.Correction: An earlier headline misstated Barry Sternlicht's quote.

""The tension leading to this cutthroat game of musical chairs [among workers], they want that eased.""And there are finally signs this is happening.""There were 1.7 job openings per unemployed worker in August, down from nearly two openings per unemployed in July. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has cited this ratio as one that officials would like to see fall as an indicator of labor market cooling. That said, job openings are still high by historical standards, meaning workers have ample opportunities, labor economists said. Openings hovered around 7 million before the pandemic; they peaked near 11.9 million in March 2022.""I'd say the job market still leans toward workers,"" said Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor. ""But because things are cooling off, we can't guarantee that will continue moving forward.""The level of voluntary quitting among workers ticked up by 100,000 people from July to August, to almost 4.2 million, according to the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Quits are a gauge of worker confidence and sentiment, so the slight increase and historically high level suggest workers remain in the driver's seat, Pollak said. Most workers who leave their current jobs do so for employment elsewhere, economists said. They typically get a bigger pay bump than those who stay in their current roles: a 7% annual boost for job switchers in August versus 5% for job stayers, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.Meanwhile, layoffs remain low and have increased only modestly as employers try to hang onto the workers they have, economists said.Even though workers still seem to have the upper hand, they may want to proceed more cautiously going forward relative to quitting and switching jobs due to the prospect of a further moderation in the labor market, Zhao said.""Last year, the job market was strong enough that it was easier for folks to quit without having something else lined up,"" Zhao said. ""I think the situation now is much softer. Anyone looking for a new job has to evaluate things on a company-by-company basis."""
2022-10-04,"Two years ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping formally announced the world's second largest economy would strive for peak carbon emissions in 2030, and carbon neutrality in 2060.While the country struggles to wean itself off coal, analysts said Beijing's top-level emphasis on climate has fueled a policy push to try to support businesses focused on renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions.Still, the last two years show how Chinese leaders still struggle to balance growth and economic interests with achieving climate goals, especially in an economy where coal is the dominant energy source. BEIJING — China says it wants to be carbon neutral by 2060 — and those stated ambitions are spawning companies that could one day become global leaders in their fields.Two years ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping formally announced the world's second largest economy would strive for peak carbon emissions in 2030, and carbon neutrality in 2060.related investing newsLithium has started coming back after a 'freefall' in China. What to know about the investing landscapeAlex Harring15 hours agoTesla and more: Morgan Stanley names EV stocks set to benefit as supply chains move WestGanesh Raoa day agoTo be carbon neutral means the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the whole country will be offset in other ways. It also means there shouldn't?/won't? be any increase in greenhouse emissions in China after 2030.While the country struggles to wean itself off coal, analysts said Beijing's top-level emphasis on climate has fueled a policy push to try to support businesses focused on renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions.""China's already a leader in so many parts of the decarbonization effort,"" said Norman Waite, energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).""They're either leading or right in the pack with everybody else in the efforts to decarbonize. It's not a one- or two-company effort. This is a bunch of companies who are pressing forward,"" he said. Electric cars and batteries have been an obvious growth area, with Chinese EV makers expanding their businesses beyond China.Chinese electric car giant and battery maker BYD launched passenger cars for Europe in late September, while start-up Nio is set to hold its European launch event in Berlin in early October.Technologies to store and transmit power generated via renewable sources are another area that analysts are watching. ""More of the Chinese companies are getting to the size in China that they start to go out as well and establish partnerships abroad"" in energy storage, said Johan Annell, partner at Asia Perspective, a consulting firm that works primarily with Northern European companies operating in East and Southeast Asia.In energy efficiency, equipment for heating and cooling, Annell said, ""you're also getting a lot of Chinese companies going out and starting to win business, particularly in the countries surrounding China"" — such as Mongolia and Kazakhstan. The offshore wind sector is another field that could see an emerging Chinese leader.Offshore wind is a renewable energy that uses turbines in coastal waters — many of which can be installed near the world's largest urban centers, IEEFA's Waite said in a September report. Mingyang Smart Energy, already a leader in offshore wind power in China, ""appears poised to disrupt international, non-Chinese markets at a vulnerable time for established competitors,"" Waite said. He noted the company can tackle overseas markets with its strong balance sheet, large production capacity and potentially aggressive pricing power.The industry's three global players — Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, Denmark's Vestas Wind System and General Electric — ""are racking up losses, and only Vestas is doing so without the further stress of an imminent restructuring,"" he said. Vestas said it doesn't comment on its competitors, and the two other companies did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. In December, Mingyang signed a memorandum of understanding to build a factory in the U.K. and explore options for entering the local British market.The company's other projects or contracts include partners in Italy, Japan and Vietnam, Waite said.The U.K. and the rest of Europe are each expected to add about 10 gigawatts of offshore wind power in the next three years, according to IEEFA Research.In the following five years, that capacity is set to triple in the U.K., and increase by five-fold in the European mainland to about 60 gigawatts, the report said. For Chinese companies, aligning with the country's carbon neutrality theme fits well with Beijing's other directives — for improving innovation, moving into higher-end industrial manufacturing and boosting non-traditional infrastructure investment, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL.""If you are a rational agency of the local government, your actions under the rationale will be focused [on projects] under the name of new infrastructure investment,"" he said.

This global stock with 55% upside offers uranium price exposure, BoA says National security is another factor driving China's focus on developing energy sources.""Energy security is given more of a priority because of the economic challenges and the socioeconomic challenges,"" said Seungjoo Ro, CLSA's head of ESG research, sustainability and corporate governance research.Ro pointed out that there are still 38 years to go in China's carbon neutral roadmap, and it's still not entirely clear how investors can measure potential share price returns based solely on climate-related measures right now.  In practice, some $22 trillion are required to achieve China's ambitious carbon goals, according to a report from the World Economic Forum and Oliver Wyman.""To achieve its ambitious carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals, China needs to close an annual funding gap of about RMB1.1 trillion ($170 billion),"" the summer report pointed out. ""It can only do so if it manages to develop far more sophisticated green financing schemes.""And if Chinese companies want to play a role in global efforts to reach environment goals, some differences between local standards need to be resolved with international ones, said Kelly Tian, financial services-focused principal at Oliver Wyman.The last two years show how Chinese leaders still struggle to balance growth and economic interests with achieving climate goals, especially in an economy where coal is the dominant energy source.Overenthusiastic measures to force local areas to cut carbon emissions last year resulted in a power shortage that disrupted factory production. China ended up adding coal production capacity this year, helping the country stave off similar power shortages, despite extreme dry and hot weather in parts of the country, said Cory Combs, associate director at research and consulting firm Trivium China, in a September report published by Asia Society Policy Institute.Even if the carbon directives come from the top leadership, Combs said there's still tension between short-term and longer-term economic interests that will likely last through the coming decade.Reducing that tension will help China reduce carbon emissions, he said. ""But China's leaders also recognize that, in the long term, China's development will not be economically sustainable – and hence politically and socially sustainable – until it is also environmentally so.""China's state-run media has promoted environmental improvements across the country. And after years of some of the worst air pollution in the world, conditions in Beijing have improved so much in the last year that locals can frequently see far-off mountains and stars from the center of the city."
2022-10-05,"Germany's economy minister has accused the U.S. and other ""friendly"" gas supplier states of astronomical prices for their supplies.He suggested some gas suppliers were profiting from the fallout from the war in Ukraine which has sent global energy prices soaring. Germany's economy minister accused the U.S. and other ""friendly"" gas supplier states of astronomical prices for their supplies, suggesting they were profiting from the fallout from the war in Ukraine.""Some countries, including friendly ones, sometimes achieve astronomical prices [for their gas]. Of course, that brings with it problems that we have to talk about,"" Economy Minister Robert Habeck told regional German paper NOZ in an interview published Wednesday which was translated by NBC News. He called for more solidarity from the U.S. when it comes to assisting its energy-pressed allies in Europe.""The United States contacted us when oil prices shot up, and the national oil reserves in Europe were tapped as a result. I think such solidarity would also be good for curbing gas prices,"" he said.CNBC contacted the White House for a response to the comments and is awaiting a reply.Habeck, co-leader of Germany's Green Party, which is a part of Berlin's coalition government led by center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said the EU should also do more to address the region's gas crisis, with countries scrambling for alternative supplies which has pressured prices even more, that was brought about by the war in Ukraine and deteriorating relations with Russia. Moscow's state-owned gas giant, Gazprom, has cut supplies to the bloc drastically over the last few months, largely due to international sanctions and a desire to punish Europe — the EU used to import around 45% of its gas supplies from Russia but is seeking to halt all imports — for supporting Kyiv.Habeck said the EU ""should pool its market power and orchestrate smart and synchronized purchasing behavior by the EU states so that individual EU countries do not outbid each other and drive up world market prices."" European market power is ""enormous,"" it just has to be used, he noted, according to the German news outlet.Europe is facing a hard winter with gas shortages predicted across the region. Countries like Germany have been largely dependent on Russian gas supplies for decades with massive energy infrastructure, such as the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, designed to bring gas from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea.While the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline was never even launched, with Germany refusing to certify the pipeline following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, Nord Stream 1 has become a pawn in souring relations between Moscow and Brussels.Over the summer, gas supplies via the pipeline stopped and started seemingly at Moscow's whim, although it invariably cited the need for maintenance and sanctions as a reason for halting supplies. But then supplies came to a halt in September.More recently, Russia and Europe's energy ties have literally been damaged with the Nord Stream pipelines suffering leaks last month under suspicious circumstances.Russia denied it had sabotaged the pipelines, with reported underwater explosions damaging the pipes in several places, sending natural gas spewing into the Baltic Sea. The damage prompted an international outcry with the EU vowing a ""robust"" response to attacks on its energy infrastructure."

Globally, CEOs are also viewing mergers, acquisitions and innovation favorably, but many are concerned that dealmakers are ""taking a much sharper pencil to the numbers and focus on value creation to unlock and track deal value,"" the KPMG report said.Across the globe, aside from recessions and the economic impact of rising interest rates, CEOs are also worried about pandemic fatigue, KPMG said. On top of immediate challenges such as a recession, business leaders say they remain under pressure to meet their broader social responsibilities in the face of public scrutiny on their corporate purpose and environmental, social and governance (ESG) accountabilities.  In Asia-Pacific, fewer CEOs are expecting a recession. Of those surveyed, 63% saw a recession happening in the next year compared with 86% globally. But they are also less optimistic about growth in the next three years compared with their global peers. Globally and in Asia-Pacific, about 20% say they will not expand hiring in the next three years and will keep their headcount or reduce it further.  In Singapore, nearly 90% of the CEOs surveyed either embarked on a hiring freeze, or were planning to do so over the next six months, KPMG said. Almost all of them were taking or planning diversifications in their supply chains. But over the next three years, almost all Singapore CEOs surveyed said they would increase their headcount by up to 10%. ""Nearly a third of Singapore CEOs say their top operational priority over the next three years will be to strengthen their employee value proposition to attract and retain the necessary talent,"" the survey showed. Changes in global corporate tax rules are at the front of mind for Singapore's business leaders. Many have developed a better grasp of the new global tax rules even though those have been delayed to 2024, KPMG says.Singapore is part of a global framework for the reform of international tax rules which backs a global minimum effective corporate tax of 15%. The new agreement is aimed at stopping companies from shifting profits to low-tax havens."
2022-10-05,"OPEC and non-OPEC partners on Wednesday agreed to impose deep output cuts, seeking to spur a recovery in oil prices despite U.S. pressure to pump more.Crude prices have fallen to roughly $80 a barrel from more than $120 in early June amid growing fears about the prospect of a global economic recession. A group of some of the world's most powerful oil producers on Wednesday agreed to impose deep output cuts, seeking to spur a recovery in crude prices despite calls from the U.S. to pump more to help the global economy.OPEC and non-OPEC allies, a group often referred to as OPEC+, decided at their first face-to-face gathering in Vienna since 2020 to reduce production by 2 million barrels per day from November.related investing newsThe Fed could enact a 'substitute' interest rate hike at its June meetingJeff Coxa day agoEnergy market participants had expected OPEC+, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, to impose output cuts of somewhere between 500,000 barrels and 2 million barrels. The move represents a major reversal in production policy for the alliance, which slashed output by a record 10 million barrels per day in early 2020 when demand plummeted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The oil cartel has since gradually unwound those record cuts, albeit with several OPEC+ countries struggling to fulfill their quotas.Oil prices have fallen to roughly $80 a barrel from more than $120 in early June amid growing fears about the prospect of a global economic recession.The production cut for November is an attempt to reverse this slide, despite repeated pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden's administration for the group to pump more to lower fuel prices ahead of midterm elections next month.International benchmark Brent crude futures traded at $92.82 a barrel during Wednesday afternoon deals in London, up around 1.1%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures, meanwhile, stood at $87.37, almost 1% higher.OPEC+ will hold its next meeting on Dec. 4. The White House said in a statement that Biden was ""disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.""It said that Biden had directed the Department of Energy to release another 10 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve next month.""In light of today's action, the Biden Administration will also consult with Congress on additional tools and authorities to reduce OPEC's control over energy prices,"" the White House said.The statement added that the OPEC+ announcement served as ""a reminder of why it is so critical that the United States reduce its reliance on foreign sources of fossil fuels.""To be sure, the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, is the chief driver of the climate emergency. Speaking at a news conference, OPEC Secretary-General Haitham Al Ghais defended the group's decision to impose a deep output cut, saying OPEC+ was seeking to provide ""security [and] stability to the energy markets.""Asked by CNBC's Hadley Gamble whether the alliance was doing so at a price, Al Ghais replied: ""Everything has a price. Energy security has a price as well."" Energy analysts said the actual impact of the group's supply cuts for November was likely to be limited, with unilateral reductions by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Kuwait likely to do the main job.What's more, analysts said it is currently difficult for OPEC+ to form a view more than a month or two into the future as the energy market faces the uncertainty of more European sanctions on non-OPEC producer Russia — including on shipping insurance, price caps and reduced petroleum imports. ""In its own words, OPEC's mission is to ensure an adequate pricing environment for both consumers and producers. Yet the decision to reduce output in the current environment runs counter to this objective,"" Stephen Brennock, a senior analyst at PVM Oil Associates in London, said in a research note.""Further squeezing already-tight supplies will be a slap in the face for consumers. The selfishly motivated move is aimed purely at benefiting producers,"" he added. ""In short, OPEC+ is prioritising price above stability at a time of great uncertainty in the oil market."" Rohan Reddy, director of research at Global X ETFs, told CNBC that the group's decision to impose production cuts could see oil prices rally back to $100 a barrel — assuming no major bouts of Covid globally and the U.S. Federal Reserve not becoming unexpectedly hawkish.""Due to the decision, volatility will likely return to the market, and despite concerns about the resilience of the global economy, the oil market is tight, all of which should serve as a tailwind for prices in the fourth quarter,"" Reddy said.He added that while a return to $100 oil is possible, ""a more likely scenario in the short term is that oil prices hover in the $90 to $100 range as the market digests economic data releases.""—CNBC's Emma Graham contributed to this article."
2022-10-06,"Fewer Americans are paying for routine weekly purchases like food or gas in cash, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center.But paying in cash is not dead, particularly for some demographics.Here's how much money you may want to have in your wallet in a pinch. Cold, hard cash could be going by the wayside for many Americans when it comes to routine transactions like paying for groceries or gas. Even so, it's still important to keep some cash in your wallet, experts say.The cashless economy trend is not necessarily new, but it is gaining momentum, according to new research from the Pew Research Center.The nonpartisan fact think tank found 41% of Americans say none of their purchases in a typical week are paid for in cash. That's up from 29% in 2018 and 24% in 2015.In contrast, 59% of respondents say they still pay for at least some of their typical weekly purchases in cash.More from Personal Finance:More car buyers pay at least $1,000 a month for their loan46% of consumers make this credit card mistakeThese money deal breakers could sour a relationshipMeanwhile, those who say they use cash for all or almost all of their weekly transactions in a typical week is now 14%, down from 18% in 2018 and 24% in 2015.The results are based on a broader survey of 6,034 adults conducted in July that looked at people's experiences with money, shopping and investing.The poll did not delve into what other forms of payments people prefer in place of paper currency. However, in a separate report Pew Research Center has found payment apps like PayPal, Venmo, Zelle and CashApp have been gaining traction particularly with adults under 50. Certain demographics tend to turn to cash more than others.Adults 50 and up are more likely to say they always have cash on hand, with 71%, versus 45% of adults under 50.More than half of adults younger than 50 — 54% — don't worry about having cash on them, in contrast to 28% of consumers 50 and older.Black and Hispanic adults were also more likely to say all or almost all of their weekly purchases are paid for in cash, with 26% and 21%, respectively. Just 12% of white respondents said the same. ""Even though we see a shift that more and more people are forgoing cash, there are people who are still reliant on that,"" said Monica Anderson, associate director of internet and technology research at Pew Research Center.People who tend to use cash also tend to have lower incomes. Those who use cash for all or most of their weekly purchases is 30% for those with household incomes below $30,000, versus 20% for those with incomes between $30,000 and $49,999 and 6% among households with incomes of $50,000 or more.The Covid-19 pandemic was thought to accelerate the transition to contactless payments as more people took precautions.""These are trends that we have seen shifting even before the pandemic,"" Anderson noted. Still, there are times when only cash will do, such as when a businesses only accepts currency or you want to give someone a tip.""While it comes down to personal preference, I'd say that most people probably don't need to carry more than $50 in cash,"" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com.""In fact, many could probably get by with $20 or less,"" he said.Cash is good for two things: privacy and anonymity, according to Rossman. Moreover, for the estimated 5.4% of households who are unbanked, cash transactions are crucial, he noted.Most people prefer credit or debt cards as their payment methods, according to Rossman. Credit cards in particular offer rewards, buyer protections and convenience. Because of that, Rossman said he is a ""big fan"" of that payment method.But those advantages only pay off if you're able to pay the balance in full every month and avoid the high interest rates those cards charge, Rossman said.Credit card interest rates are becoming more expensive as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates in an effort to curb record high inflation."

2022-10-06,"This could be a prolonged period of economic uncertainty and market volatility, but there is still plenty of upside potential for investors, according to top advisors on the 2022 CNBC Financial Advisor 100 list. Here are a few of the strategies they are using to steer their clients through the downturn. Investors have recently witnessed some of the worst trading days since 2020.Stocks took a dive in September over fears the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike cycle will cause the economy to stall, but with more hikes to come, along with slowing growth, geopolitical unrest and persistent inflationary pressure, this could be a prolonged period of uncertainty and market volatility.And yet, there are ""opportunities,"" even now, said Ronald Albahary, a chartered financial analyst and the chief investment officer of Wetherby Asset Management, which ranked No. 20 on the CNBC FA 100 list of top financial advisors for 2022.Perspective is key, according to Albahary. ""There are some relatively easy things investors can do to take advantage of this environment,"" he said, ""if you can look through the fog of negative sentiment.""

""It's usually darkest before dawn,"" he said.Keller relies on the ""barbell approach"" to hedge against uncertainty in the face of rising rates and the possibility the market could still pull back 10% or more.The barbell approach is an investing strategy that looks to find a balance between risk and reward by investing in high-risk and low-risk assets while avoiding more middle-risk options. Keller's clients have half their fixed-income allocation in long-term bonds and the rest in shorter-term maturities.""If we do see the market come down another 10% to 20% range, it will be an extraordinary buying opportunity,"" Keller said.Here are three strategies the top-ranked advisors are using to steer their clients through the downturn: ""If you were 60% or 70% in equities, reduce that to 40% or 50%,"" advised Mirsberger. ""The bonds side can carry a greater weight because there is less volatility and more opportunity.""As for stocks, stick with the best companies across a range of sectors. Look for ""strong brands,"" he said, ""like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — we are still seeing value in these perennial growers.""""The market selloff has been indiscriminate; quality companies will recover faster than others,"" Mirsberger added. For his clients, Keller also recommends reducing exposure to emerging markets, staying with high-quality stocks and diversifying.  ""I would want to remain very diversified here because, in the end, it's difficult to pick one sector over another and the prices are low enough,"" he said. ""If you are thinking out three to five years, you're going to make some really good money.""    Since the Fed has hiked rates, Treasury yields have soared. ""The good news is now you can get income from your very conservative portfolio or Treasurys,"" Albahary said.That makes short-term, relatively risk-free Treasury bonds and funds suddenly more attractive.""Savers have been punished for 20 years,"" Mirsberger said. ""This is really the first opportunity what many would say is an acceptable level of return without much risk."" Albahary agreed that investors should shift some allocations to fixed income.""Fixed income, which has been more 'fixed' than 'income' for far too many years, is becoming more attractive,"" Albahary said. ""You are now getting paid 4% or more for a risk-free asset, that's somewhat of a fat pitch,"" he added, referring to an easy win.Both advisors suggest laddering your Treasurys to ensure you earn the best rates, a strategy that entails holding bonds to the end of their term. To take advantage of the recent sell-off, bank those losses and use them to offset future profits.""This is the time to harvest those losses,"" Keller said. ""I think of it like money in the bank.""Tax-loss harvesting lets you offset investment gains and, if losses exceed gains, up to $3,000 of ordinary income. Anything left over can carry forward to future tax years.""That puts a dollar in your pocket, versus 75 cents,"" Albahary added.Just be careful to avoid the ""wash sale rule:"" If you reinvest in a substantially identical investment during a 30-day window before or after the sale, then you can no longer book the loss for tax purposes.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."
2022-10-07,"The unemployment rate among Hispanic workers dropped sharply in September, but declining labor force participation indicated fewer eligible adults found employment or searched for work.The unemployment rate fell to 3.8% from 4.5% in August.Labor force participation dipped to 66.1% from 66.8% in August. The unemployment rate among Hispanic workers dropped sharply in September, but that could be due to fewer eligible adults looking for a job.Hispanic workers saw their unemployment rate fall to 3.8% from 4.5% in August. Broken down by gender, unemployment declined to 3.2% among Hispanic males over 20 years old and 3.6% among females.The decline is much bigger than the one seen at the country level. The government said the overall jobless rate fell to 3.5% from 3.7% in August, its lowest level since July. A total of 263,000 jobs were created last month, less than a Dow Jones forecast of 275,000.  But Hispanics saw a sharp decline in labor force participation, which tracks how many people are employed or searching for work. It fell to 66.1% from 66.8% in August, indicating fewer individuals are finding employment or searching for work as the employment-to-population ratio tracking the proportion of the population employed dipped to 63.5%.""That decline from 4.5% in August to 3.8%, while really significant, has to be tempered by the fact that clearly, Latinx workers withdrew from the workforce,"" said Michelle Holder, a distinguished senior fellow at Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Many Hispanic workers do seek employment in some areas of the market heavily affected by Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, she added.Lea este artículo en español aquí.While Hispanic workers saw the biggest declines on a month-to-month basis, she noted that Black women have still seen the sharpest decline in labor force participation since the start of the pandemic.While the decline in participation is a reason for concern, areas of the labor market where Hispanic workers are overrepresented did experience significant gains in September, noted William Spriggs, chief economist of the AFL-CIO. Those sectors included leisure and hospitality and construction where payrolls were up 83,000 and 19,000, respectively.But those numbers don't come without their downsides, he said.""This is disturbing because it means Hispanic workers are finding great difficulty moving out of their pockets and the big story of this recovery has been the success of women and Black workers to move out of the trap of just being in low-wage industries,"" he said.  Fluctuations in the employment market tend to show up among Black and Hispanic workers first, Spriggs said, noting that unemployment among Black workers ticked down and labor force participation rose after two months of a concerning trend of rising unemployment and declining participation.""The good news for Black workers is in many ways wiped out for Hispanic workers,"" he said.To be sure, Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute's program on race, ethnicity and the economy, said individuals should hold off on drawing firm conclusions from one month of data.Fluctuations are common in monthly reports and require several consecutive periods of a similar move before one can deduce a trend.""It's still hard to understand whether we're just seeing volatility in the series because it's a smaller sample size,"" Wilson said.— CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed reporting.

""Most of the inflation is behind us, and then the biggest threat is recession, not inflation, today.""Siegel said he thinks interest rates are high enough that they could bring inflation down to 2%, and the terminal rate, or end point, should be between 3.75% and 4%.In September, the Fed raised benchmark interest rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3%-3.25%, the highest it has been since early 2008.

2022-10-10,"The U.S. dollar rose for a fourth straight session on Monday as investors looked to inflation data later this week that is likely to show that price pressures remain elevated in the world's largest economy, keeping the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy on track to continue until next year.Sterling, on the other hand, fell for a fourth straight trading day even after the Bank of England (BoE) expanded its support for financial markets.U.S. data due on Thursday is forecast to show that headline inflation came in at a hot 8.1% year-on-year rate in September, but down from 8.3% in August. Core inflation is expected to have risen to 6.5% from 6.3% previously.Chicago Fed President Charles Evans on Monday said inflation is much more persistent than the U.S. central bank initially thought. But he noted that the Fed may still be able to lower inflation without a sharp rise in unemployment and without pushing the economy into a recession.The U.S. dollar index was last up 0.3% at 113.14, off the lows of around 110 last week and creeping back toward last month's 20-year high of 114.78. The euro was down 0.4% at $0.9705.U.S. data last Friday showed that unemployment unexpectedly fell and the economy added more jobs than predicted in September. That pushed up bond yields as traders increased their bets the Fed would hike interest rates by 75 basis points in November for the fourth meeting running.""By illustrating continued strength in the labor market, Friday's non-farm payrolls report gave the Fed carte blanche to continue raising rates,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist, at Corpay in Toronto.He added that the minutes from the Fed's last meeting, due on Wednesday, ""are likely to show policymakers remain willing to inflict serious economic pain on the U.S. and global economies as they try to bring down inflation.""In Britain, the Bank of England attempted to ease concerns about the end of its emergency bond-buying scheme.UK markets went into a tailspin in late September after the government unveiled a plan to slash taxes and ramp up borrowing. The pound tumbled and the BoE was forced to intervene to prop up bond markets.The BoE said it was prepared to buy as much as 10 billion pounds ($11.07 billion) of gilts on Monday, double the previous limit. It also created a new program to help banks more easily access cash.Sterling slipped for a fourth session running despite the BoE's move. It was last down 0.2% at $1.1054, although it remained well above the Sept. 26 record low of $1.0327.Geopolitical tensions and higher oil prices also caused renewed nervousness about growth, pushing investors back toward the dollar.Russia pounded Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities with missiles in response to a blast that hit its only bridge to Crimea.

2022-10-10,"The Fed likely is making a mistake in its hard-line stance against inflation because it is looking backward, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said Monday.In an open letter, Wood suggested the central bank ""has shocked not just the US but the world and raised the risks of a deflationary bust."" The Federal Reserve likely is making a mistake in its hard-line stance against inflation Ark Investment Management's Cathie Wood said Monday in an open letter to the central bank.Instead of looking at employment and price indexes from previous months, Wood said the Fed should be taking lessons from commodity prices that indicate the biggest economic risk going forward is deflation, not inflation.""The Fed seems focused on two variables that, in our view, are lagging indicators –– downstream inflation and employment ––both of which have been sending conflicting signals and should be calling into question the Fed's unanimous call for higher interest rates,"" Wood said in the letter posted on the firm's website.Specifically, the consumer price and personal consumption expenditures price indexes both showed inflation running high. Headline CPI rose 0.1% in August and was up 8.3% year over year, while headline PCE accelerated 0.3% and 6.2% respectively. Both readings were even higher excluding food and energy, which saw large price drops over the summer.On employment, payroll growth has decelerated but remains strong, with job gains totaling 263,000 in September as the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%.But Wood, whose firm manages some $14.4 billion in client money across a family of active ETFs, said falling prices for items such as lumber, copper and housing are telling a different story. The Fed has approved three consecutive interest rate increases of 0.75 percentage point, mostly by unanimous vote, and is expected to OK a fourth when it meets again Nov. 1-2.""Unanimous? Really?"" Wood wrote. ""Could it be that the unprecedented 13-fold increase in interest rates during the last six months––likely 16-fold come November 2––has shocked not just the US but the world and raised the risks of a deflationary bust?""Inflation is bad for the economy because it raises the cost of living and depresses consumer spending; deflation is a converse risk that reflects tumbling demand and is associated with steep economic downturns.To be sure, the Fed is hardly alone in raising rates.Nearly 40 central banks around the world approved increases during September, and the markets have largely expected all the Fed's moves.However, criticism has emerged recently that the Fed could be going too far and is at risk of pulling the economy into an unnecessary recession.""Without question, food and energy prices are important, but we do not believe that the Fed should be fighting and exacerbating the global pain associated with a supply shock to agriculture and energy commodities caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" Wood wrote.The Fed is expected to follow the November hike with a 0.5 percentage point rise in December, then a 0.25 percentage point move early in 2023.One area of the market known as overnight indexed swaps is pricing in two rate cuts by the end of 2023, according to Morgan Stanley."

The Malaysian government should be tackling Malaysia's economic problems instead of holding elections — especially when corruption has tainted the path to the polls, former Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told CNBC last week before the parliament dissolved on Monday.While many countries are facing global economic headwinds, Malaysia has deeper problems caused by economic mismanagement as a result of corruption, he told CNBC's Squawk Box Asia, adding that corruption has pushed up the ""costs of everything.""The Malaysian prime minister's office did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was recently sentenced to 12 years in prison after being found guilty of embezzling billions of dollars from Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.On Monday, Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob dissolved the country's parliament to set up an early election amid alleged reports of political infighting in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition.An election must now be held within 60 days. Polls were initially due to take place by September next year. The dissolution comes after the government handed down its 2023 budget on Friday. While leaner than last year, it is one of the country's biggest budgets with planned government spending of 372.3 billion Malaysian ringgit ($80 billion).Mahathir, as well as opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim who leads the Pakatan Harapan party, both opposed conducting early elections due to the monsoon and flood season which could affect voter turnout or put voters in harm's way.The month of November typically faces big floods, Mahathir said.""If there is an election, the government is banking on the obstruction to voters to voting because of the bad weather, in order to get their own people to support them. So this is not a very good time for election,"" he said.Additionally, many voters had received bribes from the government to vote, Mahathir told CNBC in an exclusive interview last Thursday.

2022-10-13,"El Salvador has lost around $60 million on its bitcoin bet one year into a nationwide crypto experiment.The use of bitcoin in El Salvador appears to be low amid the market volatility.The country faces plummeting economic growth and a high deficit. It has been more than a year since El Salvador made history by becoming the first country to make bitcoin legal tender, and so far, 37-year-old resident Edgardo Acevedo has found the nationwide crypto experiment to be relatively anticlimactic.""I don't think anything has changed, except that the country is more recognized than before, but the economic life of Salvadorans remains the same or worse than a few years ago,"" said Acevedo, a development engineer working in the capital city of San Salvador.related investing newsMorgan Stanley sees a sign that points to a top in bitcoinTanaya Macheel12 hours agoAcevedo, who is also known by the pseudonym Ishi Kawa, tells CNBC that while bitcoin has become a topic of conversation, adoption remains low, and he has personally found that there are very few businesses that accept the world's biggest cryptocurrency — and even fewer Salvadorans who wish to pay in the digital token.""What has improved is the issue of violence and crime, but economically, I can say that nothing has changed,"" he said.It has been a rocky time, with the project not living up to the grand promises made by the country's popular and outspoken president Nayib Bukele.The use of bitcoin in El Salvador appears to be low, as the currency has lost about 60% of its value since the experiment started and the country still faces plummeting economic growth and a high deficit. El Salvador's debt-to-GDP ratio — a key metric used to compare what a country owes with what it generates — is set to hit nearly 87% this year, stoking fears that the nation isn't equipped to settle its loan obligations.Data from Bloomberg Economics shows that El Salvador tops its ranking of emerging market countries that are vulnerable to a debt default. Even as it retires some of its outstanding debts, the country's domestic and multilateral loan obligations pose a real threat, in part because the world's biggest lenders aren't too keen to give cash to a country betting its future on one of the most volatile assets on the planet.Pair these economic woes with a renewed war on gang violence and the country is barreling toward uncertainty.""The government claims the developments as a success, but most local commentators and international watchers are underwhelmed,"" Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights, told CNBC. When El Salvador's Bitcoin Law came into effect Sept. 7, 2021, Jaime Garcia was hopeful that it would fix a few big problems with the way that Salvadorans send, receive and spend money.As part of the law, prices are now sometimes listed in bitcoin, tax contributions can be paid with the digital currency, and exchanges in bitcoin will not be subject to capital gains tax. But crucially, Bukele promoted the law as a way to expand financial inclusion — which is no small thing for a country where approximately 70% of the population does not have access to traditional financial services, according to the Bitcoin Law.To help facilitate national adoption, El Salvador launched a virtual wallet called ""chivo"" (Salvadoran slang for ""cool"") that offers no-fee transactions, allows for quick cross-border payments, and requires only a mobile phone plus an internet connection. It aimed to bring users onboard quickly, both to scale bitcoin adoption and to offer a convenient onramp for those who had never been a part of the banking system.Bukele tweeted in January that about 60% of the population, or 4 million people, used the chivo app, and more Salvadorans have chivo wallets than traditional bank accounts, according to a Sept. 20 research note from Deutsche Bank. Still, only 64.6% of the country has access to a mobile phone with internet, that note says.But a report published in April by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research showed that only 20% of those who downloaded the wallet continued to use it after spending the $30 bonus. The research was based upon a ""nationally representative survey"" involving 1,800 households.Garcia, who lives in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, fled El Salvador when he was 11 after rebels bombed his house, but he keeps in close touch with family and friends who stayed behind — and he sometimes sends money back home, too.""There are pockets where bitcoin is popular, like in El Zonte, but it's clear that adoption is not massive,"" said Garcia.""Big chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and most merchants at a mall will accept bitcoin — but are people using it? Not too much locally,"" he said. ""It's mostly tourists using bitcoin.""A survey by the El Salvador-based El Instituto de Opinion Publica, a public opinion think tank, found that 7 in 10 Salvadorans do not think the Bitcoin Law has benefited their family economy.Another survey by the institute found that 76 out of 100 small and medium-size enterprises in El Salvador do not accept bitcoin payments.""Bitcoin's first year in effect has transcended from a commercial expectation to an irrelevant topic for traders,"" said Laura Andrade, director of El Salvador's Universidad Centroamericana, according to a CNBC translation of her Spanish-language comments.Andrade said many large corporations are still advertising that they're taking payments in bitcoin but are making excuses to not accept the cryptocurrency including saying their system does not work or the bitcoin wallet is out of service.""The foregoing is evidence that this cryptocurrency, in reality, never had penetration in national commerce,"" Andrade said.""There seems to be evidence that most people used it primarily to get the free money from the government but have not used it on an ongoing basis given volatility and fees,"" Ziemba said.Meanwhile, those who did use the government's crypto wallet reportedly had technical problems with the app. Other Salvadorans fell prey to schemes involving identity theft, in which hackers used their national ID number to open a chivo e-wallet, in order to claim the free $30 worth of bitcoin offered by the government as an incentive to join.A survey published in March by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of El Salvador found that 86% of businesses have never made a sale in bitcoin, and only 20% of businesses take bitcoin, despite the Law's mandate that all merchants accept the cryptocurrency.""They gave people the wallets, they forced businesses to accept them, but essentially, in my opinion, it's a big nothing burger,"" said Frank Muci, a policy fellow at the London School of Economics, who has experience advising governments in Latin America. ""Nobody really uses the app to pay in bitcoin. People that do use it, mostly use it for dollars.""The experiment also involved building a nationwide infrastructure of bitcoin ATMs, but they're too far away for many people to use.Another hope for the chivo wallet was that it would help save hundreds of millions of dollars in remittance fees. Remittances, or money sent home by migrants, account for more than 20% of El Salvador's gross domestic product, and some households receive over 60% of their income from this source alone. Incumbent services can charge 10% or more in fees for those international transfers, which can sometimes take days to arrive and require a physical pickup.But in 2022, recent data shows that only 1.6% of remittances were sent to El Salvador via digital wallets. According to the Deutsche Bank report from September, part of the reason bitcoin transfers haven't caught on has to do with the complications of buying and selling bitcoin for dollars. The report notes that ""people who send and receive remittances frequently use informal brokers to convert local currency to and from bitcoin"" and extremely volatile prices make buying and selling the cryptocurrency a complex task requiring technical know-how.""This is a new money, a new way of doing things for a population that is very comfortable with dollars. This is a population that is largely unbanked and would rather deal with hard cash that they can see and feel,"" Garcia said.Miles Suter, the crypto product lead at Cash App, told CNBC on a panel at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York that the government's 90-day rollout of the chivo wallet and nationwide adoption of bitcoin was ""rushed"" and that there are still a lot of problems.""You shouldn't mandate the acceptance of a specific currency,"" said Suter, who spent six months in El Salvador in the runup to the passing of the Bitcoin Law. However, Suter added that the media perception is worse than how things are actually going on the ground.""I saw and experienced lives being changed by having access to a new emerging monetary standard,"" he said. Well before Bukele wagered that bitcoin would bandage over longstanding economic vulnerabilities, the country was in a lot of trouble.The World Bank projects that the Salvadoran economy will grow by 2.9% this year and 1.9% in 2023, down from 10.7% in 2021. But that growth itself was a bounce-back from an 8.6% contraction in 2020.Its debt-to-GDP ratio is almost 90%, and its debt is expensive at around 5% per year versus 1.5% in the U.S. The country also has a massive deficit — with no plans to reduce it, whether through tax hikes or by substantially cutting spending.In a research note from JPMorgan, analysts warn that El Salvador's eurobonds have entered ""distressed territory"" in the last year, and S&P Global data reportedly shows that the cost to insure against a sovereign debt default is hitting multiyear highs.Both JPMorgan and the International Monetary Fund warn the country is on an unsustainable path, with gross financing needs set to surpass 15% of GDP from 2022 forward — and public debt on track to hit 96% of GDP by 2026 under current policies.El Salvador faces a heavy mix of multilateral and domestic debts, including imminent debt repayment deadlines in the billions of dollars, such as an $800 million eurobond that matures in January.""The domestic debt is very large, relatively short duration and needs to be rolled over frequently,"" said Muci, who previously worked at the Growth Lab at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.El Salvador has been trying since early 2021 to secure a $1.3 billion loan from the IMF — an effort that appears to have soured over Bukele's refusal to heed the organization's advice to ditch bitcoin as legal tender.Rating agencies, including Fitch, have knocked down El Salvador's credit score, citing the uncertainty of the country's financial future given the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. That means that it's now even more expensive for Bukele to borrow much-needed cash.Beyond the fact that global lenders don't want to throw money at a country that is spending millions in tax dollars on a cryptocurrency whose price is prone to extreme volatility, the IMF's largest shareholder, the U.S., is targeting Salvadoran officials as part of wider international sanctions against ""corrupt actors.""The president's efforts to consolidate power have also driven up this risk premium for global lenders.Bukele's New Ideas party has control over the country's Legislative Assembly. In 2021, the new assembly came under fire after it ousted the attorney general and top judges. The move prompted the U.S. Agency for International Development to pull aid from El Salvador's national police and a public information institute and reroute the funds to civil society groups.Additionally, El Salvador can't print cash to shore up its finances. El Salvador ditched its local currency, the colon, in favor of the U.S. dollar. Only the Federal Reserve can print more dollars. Meanwhile, its other national currency, bitcoin, is revered for the fact that it, too, is impossible to mint out of thin air.""One of the big issues has been the fact that the bitcoin gimmick has distracted from the fiscal and economic challenges of the country and made it more difficult for the country to access IFI lending and preferential terms,"" Ziemba said.Ziemba added that there have been some swaps with major crypto firms that allowed the country to raise cash to pay off the debt due this year, and perhaps early next year, but the long-term debt sustainability remains a challenge.""They've spooked the bejesus out of financial markets and the IMF,"" said Muci, who tells CNBC that nobody wants to lend money to Bukele unless it's at ""eye-gouging rates"" of 20% to 25%.""The country is sleepwalking into a debt default,"" Muci said. On the day the Bitcoin Law took effect, Bukele revealed that the country had begun to add bitcoin to government coffers. Since then, the price of the cryptocurrency has plunged more than 60%, stoked by rising interest rates and failed projects and bankruptcies in the industry.The government has an unrealized paper loss on bitcoin of around $60 million, according to sources, including bitcoin company Coinkite, which track the president's public announcements of bitcoin purchases. None of these losses are locked in until the country exits its bitcoin position.In aggregate, the entire experiment and all its associated costs have only set the government back around $375 million, according to estimates. That's not nothing — especially considering the fact that El Salvador has $7.7 billion of bonds outstanding — but to an economy of $29 billion, it is comparatively small.El Salvador's millennial, tech-savvy president — who once touted himself as the ""world's coolest dictator"" on his Twitter bio — has tethered his political fate to the country's crypto gamble, so he has a very big incentive to make it work in the long run and to pay off the country's debt in the interim. Bukele faces reelection for another five-year presidential term in 2024.At least El Salvador's big bitcoin gamble has been a win in terms of attracting bitcoin tourists.The tourism industry is up 30% since the Bitcoin Law took effect, according to official government estimates. The country's tourism minister also notes that 60% of tourists now come from the U.S.The bitcoin experiment hasn't hurt the president's popularity either. Bukele's approval ratings are north of 85% — thanks in large part to his tough-on-crime approach to leading. That's no small thing to a country that was more dangerous per capita than Afghanistan five years ago.Suter said the project has also introduced many locals to the concept of savings, noting that before the Bitcoin Law, much of the population didn't have a way to digitally hold their money and transact among one another.""It was all cash — and the cash that you earned that week, you typically spent it, because there wasn't much ability to dream of growing it through investment."" The president upped the ante in November when he announced plans to build a ""Bitcoin City"" next door to the Conchagua volcano in southeastern El Salvador. The bitcoin-funded city would offer significant tax relief, and geothermal energy rolling off the adjacent volcano would power bitcoin miners.But now, Bitcoin City is on hold, as is the $1 billion bitcoin bond sale, which was initially put on ice in March because of unfavorable market conditions.""Ultimately, El Salvador's problems are just tangential to currency,"" Muci said.""The plane is gonna crash eventually, if they don't change things,"" he said — ""if they don't raise taxes, cut spending, start being much more disciplined, convincing markets that they're sustainable.""""Bitcoin doesn't solve any of El Salvador's important economic problems,"" he added."
2022-10-13,"The European Central Bank needs to raise interest rates into positive territory when taking into account inflation, despite recession fears, Belgium's central bank chief told CNBC.""My bet would be it's going to be over 2%, and I would not be surprised if we have to go to above 3% at some point,"" said Pierre Wunsch, governor of the National Bank of Belgium.September's hike in the ECB's benchmark deposit rate to 0.75% meant rates were still negative in real terms, he said.  The European Central Bank needs to raise interest rates into positive territory when taking into account inflation, despite recession risks, Belgium's central bank chief told CNBC.September's hike in the ECB's benchmark deposit rate to 0.75% meant rates were still negative in real terms, said Pierre Wunsch, governor of the National Bank of Belgium. ""Real"" interest rates are adjusted for inflation, which hit a record 10% in the euro zone in September and is forecast to be an average 8.1% for the year.""Frankly on the basis of our base case, which is now more or less a technical recession in Europe, I think we are going to have to go real positive somewhere,"" Wunsch told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore.Exactly when this should happen or what the rate will be is not clear, since it will depend on the impact of the economic slowdown on inflation and how the real rate is calculated, he said. However, he added that the key rate will ""most probably"" need to be above 2% by the end of the year.""We've been claiming that what happens in Europe is different from the U.K., from the U.S. But over the last six months basically the direction we've been taking was not that different. So my bet would be it's going to be over 2%, and I would not be surprised if we have to go to above 3% at some point,"" Wunsch said at the 2022 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group in Washington, D.C.The ECB raised rates from -0.5% to zero at its July meeting, its first hike in 11 years, after keeping rates in negative territory since 2014.The eurozone economy grew in the second quarter and unemployment is at a record low, but many analysts expect a recession, given energy supply constraints, rising rates and high inflation.The U.S. Federal Reserve, facing its own balancing act between hot inflation — with the latest figures out Thursday — and a potential recession, has taken its federal funds rate up to a range of 3%-3.25%, the highest it has been since early 2008. Officials have repeatedly indicated it will go higher.The Bank of England has also carried out a series of rate rises, and its chief economist said Wednesday a ""significant"" further rise was needed at its Nov. 3 meeting. It is currently attempting to tackle massive volatility in U.K. markets through an emergency bond-buying program, following a controversial government budget. Also speaking to CNBC's Geoff Cutmore in Washington, Austrian central bank Governor Robert Holzmann said ECB policymakers had made a conscious decision to try to ""work with the market, to express our views and to be more readable.""He flagged that the ECB's 75 basis point hike had been expected by markets, and expectations were currently that its next policy move, due Oct. 27, would be similar.""My impression and my knowledge is that the markets are spot on,"" he said. ""Talking to the market, hearing from the market also what they expect for the next meeting, I think it will be at a similar level."""
2022-10-13,"Inflation jumped by 8.2% in September versus a year earlier, hotter than expected though a slight decline from August. Consumers have seen prices for food, energy and housing rise sharply over that time.""Core"" inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, jumped to its highest level since 1982, suggesting inflation is broad-based.  Inflation was a bit hotter than expected in September, with monthly gains fueled primarily by housing, food and medical care, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday.Inflation measures how quickly the prices consumers pay for a broad range of goods and services are rising.  The consumer price index, a key inflation barometer, jumped by 8.2% in September relative to a year earlier. Economists had expected an 8.1% annual increase. Basically, a basket of goods that cost $100 a year ago cost $108.20 today.The positive news: September's annual increase was smaller than the 8.3% rise in August. The bad: Inflation is still high across many consumer categories, said Yiming Ma, an assistant professor of business at Columbia Business School.More from Personal Finance:How to make inflation-protected bonds work in your portfolioWhat to look for in your credit report to lower borrowing costsThese colleges promise no student loans""On paper, [inflation] has come down,"" Ma said. ""The elephant in the room is price levels are still increasing at an extremely high rate.""""The big picture is that inflation is high everywhere,"" she added. ""I think consumers will continue to feel it."" Food prices have been among the largest contributing categories to inflation in recent months.The ""food at home"" index — or grocery prices — jumped 13% in September versus the same time a year ago. That's a slight decline from 13.5% in August, which was the largest 12-month increase in over 40 years, since March 1979.Within that category, certain items have seen prices rise sharply over the past year, such as butter and margarine (up 32.2%), eggs (30.5%) and flour (24.2%).Gasoline prices were the primary irritant for many American households earlier this year, when national averages briefly topped $5 a gallon, but food has now ""taken that starring role,"" said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate.Even so, energy prices have been another major inflation contributor in the past year. The category — which includes gasoline, fuel oil, electricity and other items — is up 19.8%.Gasoline prices have retreated from summer highs, and currently sit at an average $3.91 per gallon nationwide, per AAA. But rates are expected to rise after a bloc of big oil producers announced last week that they plan to cut oil output.  ""Core"" inflation — a measure that strips out food and energy costs, which can be volatile — is important in terms of predicting future inflation trends, according to Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.The measure gives a sense of how broad-based inflation has gotten. That core rate rose 6.6% in the last year, up from 6.3% in August and the largest 12-month increase since August 1982, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.""Trouble is, there are more contributors to inflation than there are detractors to it right now,"" Hamrick said. ""It's not a localized problem.""Shelter, which includes rent, is up 6.6% in the last year and accounts for more than 40% of the total increase in core inflation. Increases in medical care (up 6%), household furnishings and operations (9.3%), new vehicles (9.4%), and used cars and trucks (7.2%) are other ""notable"" categories, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A healthy economy experiences a small degree of inflation each year. U.S. Federal Reserve officials aim to keep inflation around 2%.But a supply-and-demand imbalance led inflation to increase starting in early 2021, following years of low inflation.Covid-19 lockdowns, stimulus funds and other factors combined to crimp global supply lines, alter Americans' consumption of goods and services, and fuel a surge in job openings and wages, according to Hamrick. The war in Ukraine also created supply bottlenecks and raised global prices of commodities such as oil and food, he said.""The convergence of all these factors has been remarkable, unprecedented and highly complicated,"" Hamrick said. Inflation is on the rise across global economies. Global inflation is forecast to rise to 8.8% in 2022 from 4.7% in 2021 but decline to 6.5% in 2023 and to 4.1% by 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund.Despite signs of continued strong inflation in the CPI, ""there are still clear signs of disinflation everywhere else we look,"" according to a note published Thursday morning by Capital Economics.These signs include a decline in the price of used cars, which ""should continue to feed through,"" and private-sector measures of new rents, which ""point to an eventual sharp moderation in shelter inflation too,"" the note said. However, a slowdown in rent inflation likely won't be pronounced until the first half of 2023, it added.""I do think this will resolve itself, but it will take patience,"" Hamrick said."

2022-10-14,"China's consumer price index increased by 2.8% in September from a year ago, its fastest since April 2020, according to Wind Information. However, China's producer price index grew in September by its slowest since January 2021, according to Wind.Changes in China's producer price index tend to precede similar changes in that of the U.S. by about one or two months, Francoise Huang, senior economist at Allianz Trade, said in a phone interview earlier this week. BEIJING — China's consumer prices rose in September at their fastest pace in more than two years as pork prices climbed, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday.The consumer price index increased by 2.8% last month from a year ago, matching expectations from a Reuters poll.That marked the fastest pace since a 3.3% year-on-year increase in April 2020, according to Wind Information.Much of the gains came from a continued pickup in pork prices, which rose by 36% year-on-year for their biggest rise since August 2020, Wind data showed. Pork, a food staple in China, has a significant weighting in the country's official consumer price index.However, other indicators pointed to subdued consumer demand.Excluding food and energy, so-called core CPI rose by only 0.6% from a year ago — the slowest pace since March 2021, according to Wind. China's producer price index rose by 0.9% in September from a year ago, missing the Reuters estimate of 1%. The index grew by its slowest since January 2021, according to Wind.The weak core CPI and a disappointing slowdown in China's producer price index reflect soft Chinese consumer demand and declining overseas demand, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research, Greater China, JLL.He said the producer price index is expected to decline further and potentially enter negative territory in the coming months. Changes in China's producer price index tend to precede similar changes in that of the U.S. by about one or two months, Francoise Huang, senior economist at Allianz Trade, said in a phone interview earlier this week.She said the weaker Chinese economy may help central banks in other countries that are fighting domestic inflation.Following decades-high price increases, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times this year, and is expected to hike rates again in three weeks.

Shoppers remain generally flush with cash though there are indications of late that they are dipping into savings to make ends meet.The Fed has enacted multiple interest rate hikes aimed at reducing inflation and bringing the economy back into balance. Markets expect the central bank to raise rates up to 1.5 percentage points more through the end of the year.A separate report Thursday showed that import prices fell 1.2% in September, slightly more than the 1.1% estimate. Exports declined 0.8%."
2022-10-17,"Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday set the tone for the next five years with a speech that emphasized ""higher-quality"" growth and the need for national self-sufficiency.""China's economy has shifted from a period of high-speed growth to one of high quality,"" said Zhao Chenxin, member of the commission's Chinese Communist Party leadership group and vice chairman.Zhao said Monday that China would encourage foreign investment in advanced manufacturing, higher-quality services, high-tech, energy conservation and environmental protection. BEIJING — A Chinese official confirmed Monday a shift in the country's growth goals and indicated things will change for foreign investment.Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday set the tone for the next five years with a speech that emphasized ""higher-quality"" growth and the need for national self-sufficiency. He spoke less of rapid economic growth than in prior years.The economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, held the first press conference following Xi's speech with representatives overseeing food and energy security.""China's economy has shifted from a period of high-speed growth to one of high quality,"" said Zhao Chenxin, member of the commission's Chinese Communist Party leadership group and vice chairman. ""We also face a new situation for attracting foreign investment,"" he said. That's according to a CNBC translation of the Mandarin remarks.China relied heavily on foreign investment for its initial surge of growth in the 1990s to early 2000s when new government policies allowed greater foreign access to the market after decades of closure.For example, in 2013 foreign businesses in China accounted for a third of China's GDP and about 27% of employment, according to a report from the Hinrich Foundation.Much of that business was in computers and electronics, autos and leather-related products, the report said.However, foreign businesses in recent years have complained about unequal access to the Chinese market versus their peers, lack of intellectual property protection and forced technology transfers. The U.S. under the Trump administration tried to address those issues with tariffs and sanctions.Looking ahead, Zhao said Monday that China would encourage foreign investment in advanced manufacturing, higher-quality services, high-tech, energy conservation and environmental protection.He also noted specific support for such investment in the central, western and northeastern parts of China. Those are less developed parts of the country relative to the south and east coast.

""But three types of investors are conspicuously absent in our review of recent trends.""The analysts pointed to a lack of investors in the services sector, fewer European companies looking to acquire Chinese businesses and the absence of new entrants to the market.For the first eight months of the year, foreign direct investment from Germany rose by about 30% from a year earlier — faster than the 23.5% pace recorded for the first seven months, according to China's Ministry of Commerce.However, the ministry did not release updated figures for investment from the U.S., which official data showed had grown by about 36% in the first seven months of the year."
2022-10-17,"Moody's Analytics' chief economist Mark Zandi cautions that a recession may be on the horizon.In an interview with CNBC's Andrea Miller, Zandi said a recession did not occur in the first half of this year. Zandi called employment levels the ""most important indicator[s]"" of a recession. With unemployment at the low rate of 3.5%, he doesn't buy the view that two back-to-back quarters of negative growth alone are sufficient to make for a recession.But Zandi did warn that he expects layoffs to increase in the days ahead. ""With this kind of low unemployment, inflation’s going to remain a problem,"" he said, and to address that the Federal Reserve has signaled it will continue to raise interest rates in an attempt to slow down the job market.Zandi attributed the confusion about whether the U.S. experienced a recession in the first half of this year to the coronavirus pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""These two massive supply shocks have hit the economy at roughly the same time,"" Zandi said, which makes interpreting the data about the economy particularly challenging.The Moody's chief economist said that if rising prices don't ebb “the only way to get rid of that persistent stubborn inflation would be to push the economy into a recession.” If there is a recession, Zandi said it ""probably won’t happen until the second half of 2023.""As to preparing for a downturn, Zandi said Americans should ""spend, save, invest in the same way that they typically do,"" but to remain cautious.“Americans don’t need to run for the bunkers,” he said. “But maybe keep one hand on the bunker door just to be safe and sound.” Watch the full interview in the video above."
2022-10-17,"A new report indicates the travel industry in Asia-Pacific may be the only one in the world to recover by 2023.This year's ""Travel & Tourism Economic Impact"" report — an annual publication by the London-based World Travel & Tourism Council — shows that, compared with pre-pandemic levels, tourism revenue in 2020 dropped more in Asia-Pacific (59%) than anywhere else.Recovery efforts in the region were muted in 2021, with most countries there maintaining strict border restrictions. Tourism revenue's contribution to regional gross domestic product rose about 16%, lower than the 28% in Europe and 23% in North America.However, the report shows Asia-Pacific is expected to close the gap this year, with the amount of travel revenue contributing to the overall economy forecast to grow by 71%. Travel in Asia-Pacific is soaring this year — restrictions were first eased in India and Australia, then Malaysia and Thailand and other Southeast Asian nations, followed most recently by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in the north. The WTTC's report expects continued gains to Asia-Pacific's travel industry in 2023, followed by another year of positive growth in 2024.By 2025, it estimates, travel revenue will contribute 32% more to the region's GDP than it did before the pandemic — a number that far exceeds every other region's, except that of the Middle East (30%). The report estimates the average annual growth rate of the global economy will be 2.7% from 2022 to 2032. Yet, during the same period, tourism's contribution to the global economy is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.8%, according to the report.In Asia-Pacific, the numbers climb even higher, with tourism contributions to GDP expected to grow at an average annual rate of 8.5%, according to the WTTC. The WTTC predicts the global travel industry will add 126 million new jobs in the next decade. Of this, it says, about 65% will be in Asia-Pacific. Just under half of the new jobs are expected to be in China and India, according to the WTTC. Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines are also expected to see marked tourism job growth in the next decade, adding 5.3 million, 3.5 million and 3.15 million new jobs, respectively. The report notes that Asia's ability to fully rebound by 2023 could be jeopardized if China continues to restrict international travel.During the Communist Party's 20th National Congress on Sunday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country's dynamic zero-Covid policy had achieved ""positive results,"" without indicating whether the policy would change. To contain recent case spikes, officials have closed entertainment venues in Shanghai and schools in the central Chinese city of Xi'an, while placing millions of its citizens under new lockdowns.

2022-10-18,"A wild economy and confusing job market could be tanking some Gen Zer's expectations to get married, have kids or even adopt a pet.Some 86% of Gen Z interns think a recession is coming, according to Goldman Sachs' 2022 global internship survey of more than 2,470 interns over the summer, and many are working to recession-proof their future careers.Some are reconsidering big life milestones, too: In 2021, 88% of Goldman Sachs interns said they expected to get married or establish a formal relationship in the next 10 years. Among the intern class of 2022, that expectation plummeted to just 45%.Meanwhile, 60% of interns last year had expectations to get a pet and 57% believed they'd have children in in the next decade. By the intern class of 2022, those expectations dropped to just 31% planning to get a pet and 25% expecting to become parents.  It's an interesting trend for today's Gen Z students who are short-term anxious but long-term confident about their work and lives, says Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, the job-search platform for college students.One theory: As students get bombarded with bad news on the economy, ""they're not focused on those longer-term milestones, or it feels hard to think about,"" Cruzvergara says. ""Getting married, settling down, buying a house — all those take financial stability.""What's more, in response to news of inflation and company layoffs, 74%, of future grads say they're most concerned about finding a job that offers them stability and a good salary, according to Handshake's report on 2023 grads. Gen Zers aren't prioritizing romantic relationships — or if they're open to one, they want it to happen organically.A majority (52%) expect to meet their significant other in person instead of via mutual acquaintances (30%) or an app (6%), according to the Goldman Sachs intern survey.Cassidy Case, a 20-year-old junior at Arizona State University, briefly re-entered the dating scene after a summer breakup but quickly realized she hates using the apps. ""It's so much better to meet someone organically and in-person,"" she says.""Me and all my friends can attest that dating apps aren't where we expect to meet the love of our lives, so we deleted them,"" she adds. The sheer cost of going out, thanks to inflation, could also be killing the dating game, says Oliver Sims, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Arkansas. Indeed, 19% of Gen Zers, ages 18 to 25, say they've have gone into debt from what they've spent on dating, according to a September Lendingtree survey. Some Gen Zers are trading traditional life milestone goals for ones they have more control over.Sarah Wang, 21 and a senior at UCLA, is pretty optimistic about her post-grad plans. If she doesn't find a job that fulfills her passions, she can design one herself in the creator economy.And she's much more focused on exploring job opportunities that can make her mobile: ""I see work as an opportunity to travel and live in different places around the country,"" she says. In other words, settling down through marriage, kids or a pet aren't on her immediate radar. Instead, she's focused on making new friends and investing in hobbies when she's in a new place.Speaking as a recent grad, Jade Walters agrees that taking control of her career means de-prioritizing other life goals. The 23-year-old is a Howard University grad who in her final months of school launched the Ninth Semester, an early-career resource for Gen Z professionals. She now works a corporate job in Chicago full time and dedicates her spare time to building her own business.""My goals from a year or two ago are different from where I'm at now,"" she says. Post-grad life has made her more pragmatic. ""I can create all these timelines, but the timing is not up to me, so I'm just getting better on focusing on the now."" Young adulthood means she also has new goals she'd rather prioritize, like going on vacations and building a community of friends. With an uncertain job market, young people are focused on the short-term, ""enjoying life in our 20s,"" and going on a self-discovery journey through therapy and internal reflection, Walters adds.""So at the thought of having kids or getting married, you're probably thinking: 'I have so much stuff I have to worry about, and all this trauma to heal from,' and those other things are not their top priority,"" she adds. While Gen Zers may have been more optimistic about their long-term futures in 2021, as Covid levels declined and the world reopened, this year's class may be feeling the fatigue of the virus' prolonged grasp on how we live and interact.Throw in a chaotic economy and job market and ""a lot of us are still freaking about what we're doing in the next five years, but want to enjoy now and be more present in life,"" Case says. ""I've seen so many things with Covid to know that tomorrow is not promised. So being able to accept where you're going, and being on that growth journey to embrace where you are now, it's so huge.""As an admitted overthinker, Case adds, ""being present now is super important, rather than [prioritizing] those milestones.""Check out:86% of Gen Z interns think a recession is coming—and it’s changing their approach to their careersWhy does work feel so dysfunctional right now?

2022-10-18,"So far in 2022, both the stock and bond markets have posted serious losses. To find another market that looks like this one, you'd have to go all the way back to 1969, according to data from BlackRock.The S&P 500 is down nearly 24% year-to-date, and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index has surrendered about 16%. Should both indexes finish the year in the red, it would be the first time that has happened in decades.And for investors who hold both stocks and bonds, that's not how a mixed portfolio is supposed to work.""Normally, stocks and bonds have an inverse relationship,"" says Kevin Brady, a certified financial planner and vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York City. ""Historically, bonds have had a ballast effect when stocks go down. That's not happening this year.""With losses piling up in the two most common asset classes for retail investors, ""there haven't been many places to hide,"" Brady says. History shows that something pretty big has to happen for stocks and bonds to be down in the same year. In 1931, a currency crisis forced the UK to abandon the gold standard, and in 1941, markets were roiled by the U.S. entry into World War II.The last year this happened provides the closest analog for what investors are seeing now. Rapid inflation in the mid-1960s forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in an effort to cool the economy, much like what's happening today. The economy tipped into recession in 1969, which marked a year of negative returns for both stocks and bonds.Financial experts are unclear on whether the present-day economy will slide into recession (or whether it already has), but the same forces are working on stocks and bonds. Fear among investors that the Fed's actions could cause a recession have driven many to sell their stocks, pushing prices down.At the same time, interest rate increases have a material effect on bonds. Because bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions, the Fed's moves have been eroding the value of bond portfolios.""The Fed is deliberately raising interest rates to combat inflation, which is not generally helpful to your investing portfolio,"" says Steve Laipply, head of bond exchange-traded funds at BlackRock. It's impossible to know how the economy or monetary policy will shake out in the short term. Should inflation continue to run hot, the Fed could keep hiking interest rates, in turn pushing down bond prices.According to many experts, who believe much of that carnage is behind us, now may represent a compelling opportunity for bond investors, says Laipply. ""Most economists believe the Fed will succeed at cooling the economy,"" he says. ""If you have this view, bonds look attractive. We haven't seen yields at these levels in years.""In years past, when interest rates were hovering near zero, investors had to buy riskier bonds to earn a reasonable return on their investments. But the recent rate hikes mean you don't have to look very hard anymore: a two-year Treasury, a short-term bond backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, currently yields 4.45%. A year ago, a similar bond yielded less than half a percent.Plenty of other types of bonds are offering high yields, too, which gives investors options to find different sources of return in their portfolios without taking on the higher potential downsides of riskier investments like stocks. As for stock investors, a 20% decline isn't all that out of the ordinary. In fact, it falls in line with what CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall calls a ""garden-variety"" bear market. In the 10 times drawdowns of 20% to 40% have occurred since 1945, the market has returned to its peak after 27 months, on average.In other words, this happens in the stock market all the time. And if history repeats itself, your stock holdings are likely to bounce back to their previous highs relatively quickly.In the meantime, sticking with your long-term strategy and investing at a consistent clip ensures you'll be adding investments when they're trading at lower prices.""If you have a well-laid plan going, you probably don't have to make any big changes,"" says Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.One change in particular you should avoid making after a year in which nothing in your portfolio was working: making big bets on what's been doing well recently. Selling out of your diversified portfolio in favor of recent high-fliers, such as energy or commodities investments is ""a recipe for disaster,"" says Benz.This article has been updated to reflect clarified comments about bond yields from Steve Laipply.Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: ‘The best buying opportunity’: Why now is a good time to invest, according to a stock market historian"
2022-10-18,"On Monday, Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt threw out almost all of the package of tax cuts that was announced by his predecessor less than a month ago. Markets cheered the news, but analysts said the market chaos sparked by the plan had dented the U.K.'s credibility and raised questions over the predictability of fiscal policy. Gloom also still surrounds the gilt market and pound, while the public faces high inflation and potential departmental spending cuts.  LONDON — The screeching tires of the U-turn performed by the U.K. government over its flagship fiscal policies is echoing around Westminster, with the new finance minister ripping up the program of tax cuts announced less than a month before.The move was an effort to calm volatility in financial markets, particularly the bond market, which experienced a historic sell-off on the prospect of increased borrowing, which in turn threatened to destabilize British pension funds heavily invested in U.K. sovereign bonds.The yield on these bonds, which reflect the cost of borrowing for the government and influence interest rates on many products such as mortgages, eased lower after the statement Monday.The yield for short-term bonds maturing in two years was 3.69% at 11:00 a.m. London time on Tuesday; up from 3.51% before the market-roiling ""mini budget"" was announced on Sept. 23, but much lower than the 4.75% it reached on Sept. 27, before the Bank of England intervened with a temporary bond-buying program.The yield on 10-year bonds, the closely-watched benchmark seen as the indicator of long-term interest rates, remains significantly elevated at 4.045%, up from 3.49% before the budget. Loading chart... U.K. Business Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg had previously argued bond market chaos was not caused by the government, instead blaming wider economic factors such as interest rate differentials between countries.While bond yields have indeed been rising in Europe and the U.S., the scale of the movement suddenly after the announcement, which was only reversed after the BOE intervention, saw analysts and investors express a firmly opposite view; and Prime Minister Liz Truss admitted Monday evening her policies had gone ""too far and too fast.""Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at Dutch bank ING, told CNBC U.K. bonds would not be heading back to their early August levels of around 2% in the foreseeable future; but that this was due to a complex range of factors.""The world has changed since then,"" he said, ""and their risk premia is justifiably elevated."" That includes forecasts of a U.K. recession, and though they have lowered with the budget U-turn, market expectations are still for the Bank of England to hike its base rate to over 5% from the current 2.25%. Bonds tend to become less attractive when interest rates rise, decreasing their price and sending up the yield.The 10-year yield could rally back to 3.5% ""provided we get a period of stable policy-making,"" Bouvet said, though this could change if there's a new prime minister — with Truss facing calls to resign — and if the BOE begins bond sales as part of its quantitative tightening, as it initially planned when it raised rates in September. On Tuesday morning the bank said a Financial Times report that it would delay these sales was ""inaccurate."" Loading chart... But, said Bouvet, there could be wider lasting effects from the botched budget.""I think what's been damaged these past weeks is more specifically the predictability of UK fiscal policy and it will take time for investors to forget that,"" he said.This sentiment was shared by Paul Johnson, director of think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies.""There's undoubtedly a long-term damage because there's been more uncertainty created, there's lack of stability in policy,"" Johnson told CNBC's Arabile Gumede Monday.""What you've seen the current chancellor do is try to reassert that certainty and credibility, but once that credibility is lost, it's very hard to regain. And the government is going all-out to regain it at the moment.""And Tim Sarson, U.K. head of tax policy at KPMG, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that whatever the pros and cons of Truss' economic vision on its own merits, ""there couldn't have been a worse time to start experimenting with that sort of trickle-down policy.""""It was just the way that it was done, the lack of clear costing, the fact that it was being done at a time when government finances are being stretched by the need to support consumers from energy, and a time when global interest rates and gilt yields are rising,"" he said. With the ideologically-driven policy platform Truss ran on now dead in the water, there is uncertainty in many other areas.New Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt said a broad subsidy to cap consumer and business energy prices would now only run until April. Consultancy Cornwall Insight said that could see the average household bills rise from £2,500 ($2,825) to £4,348 based on current wholesale gas and electricity market trends, potentially further stoking inflation and dampening consumer spending power.The pound rallied against the dollar Monday, and at midday Tuesday was trading at $1.1302, around the pre-budget level. But that still represents a significant drop since the start of the year, and with little to support it amid predictions of a full-year U.K. recession.Claire Trachet, chief executive of business advisory Trachet, said U.K. businesses would continue to receive interest from a flurry of overseas buyers looking to capitalize on a weaker pound.""The mini-budget announcement generated mass concern from industry leaders and the investment sector following a sharp drop in the value of the pound sterling coupled with the recent surge in the country's borrowing costs. Although the reversal of several tax cuts has calmed capital markets, we are yet to see the impacts of this, and there continues to be uncertainty in the M&A sector,"" she said in emailed comments.""This has its positives and negatives, as on the one side it will attract a great deal of foreign investment to the U.K., alongside new tax incentives and favourable regulatory conditions. However, low valuations mean U.K. companies entering potential M&As may get less than they bargain for, so it is a critical moment for the sector here to show resilience."" Loading chart... Meanwhile, the public still awaits the full government budget accompanied by an independent economic forecast on Oct. 31, which Hunt said would involve ""difficult"" decisions on spending.Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the U-turn on tax cuts had ""saved"" the government £31 billion — but that an additional £40 billion in savings would be needed in order to reduce the U.K.'s debt-to-GDP ratio in three years, per its current target.""That reduction will be very painful — and perhaps politically impossible — given the pressure on health and pensions spending from an ageing population, and higher-than-usual inflation. Some tax rises, therefore, likely will be announced in the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan as well, to achieve the required consolidation,"" Tombs said in a note."
2022-10-19,"U.K. inflation rose in the year to September 2022 as the country's cost-of-living crisis continues to hammer households and businesses ahead of a tough winter. Inflation unexpectedly dipped to 9.9% in August, down from 10.1% in July, on the back of a fuel price decline. LONDON — The consumer price index rose 10.1% in September, according to estimates published Wednesday by the Office for National Statistics, just exceeding a consensus forecast among economists polled by Reuters.Reuters estimated an increase of 10% for September. The figure for September matches the 40-year high British inflation reached in July.The rate rose in the year to September 2022 as the country's cost-of-living crisis continues to hammer households and businesses ahead of a tough winter. Inflation unexpectedly dipped to 9.9% in August, down from 10.1% in July, on the back of a fuel price decline.Increasing food, transport and energy prices were the biggest contributing factors to inflation, the ONS said. Food was up 14.6% year-on-year, transport was up 10.9% compared to last year, while the price of furniture and household goods rose 10.8%.Sterling fell against the dollar following the news, trading at $1.1289, down from $1.1330.The inflation data comes just as the Bank plans to sell off some of its government bonds, known as gilts, from Nov. 1. Britain's Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt said in a statement that ""help for the most vulnerable"" will be a priority as the U.K. weathers high inflation rates, along with ""delivering wider economic stability and driving long-term growth that will help everyone.""September's inflation rate highlights the severity of the U.K.'s inflation crisis, and comes as the country weathers a period of economic volatility.On Monday the new British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt reversed the majority of the tax cuts introduced by his predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Sept. 23, and Prime Minister Liz Truss apologized for ""mistakes"" that had caused severe market turbulence.Questions are now being raised over how long Truss will remain in office. People in the U.K. are feeling ""pessimistic"" about the price of groceries, with 84% saying they spent the same or more on groceries in the last three months, according to McKinsey & Company.""The level of inflation is already driving consumers to think differently about Christmas with 58% planning to cut back on Christmas spending and 8% not planning to do any shopping at all,"" Samantha Phillips, a partner at McKinsey, said in a research note.The forecast from the ONS won't prompt the Bank of England to reassess how it approaches interest rates, according to Marcus Brookes, chief investment officer at Quilter Investors.""[The Bank of England] may be satisfied by the moves made in Westminster for now, but in the coming weeks, we will see what it really makes of the government's fiscal policy as it makes its next move at its November Monetary Policy Committee meeting,"" Brookes said."
2022-10-19,"The housing market has become especially tough for multigenerational households for two reasons.The first is that home prices, even as they are starting to cool, have jumped sharply in the past year.Second, there were 59.7 million U.S. residents living with multiple generations under the same roof in March 2021, according to Pew Research. That’s up from 14.5 million in 1971. A combination of rising interest rates, high home values and limited inventory has been squeezing prospective homebuyers — and perhaps few know that as well as Juan Espinoza does.The 23-year-old resident of Santa Ana, California, has been on a three-year search for a dwelling that's within the family budget that includes the four in his own family — and his parents.related investing newsGet paid for doing nothing: What you should know about cash sweep accountsDarla Mercado, CFP®6 hours ago""We live in an apartment right now, just waiting for the market to come down a little bit,"" Espinoza said. ""We've been outbid so many times I've lost track of how many houses we saw.""Lea en español aquí.The family is facing two trends that have made the search especially difficult. The first is that home prices, even as they are beginning to cool, have jumped sharply in the past year. And the Espinozas have been searching in Orange County where the median home price was $987,950 during the third quarter, up 11% from the year-earlier period, according to ATTOM Data. The second is that the Espinozas are among the millions of people with multiple generations residing under one roof. In March 2021, there were 59.7 million U.S. residents in that living arrangement, up from 14.5 million in 1971, according to Pew Research.Mortgage rates have also surged as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures not seen in about 40 years. The rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reached 6.66% on Oct. 6 according to Freddie Mac. It was 2.99% on Oct. 7, 2021.""We're going to make them homeowners, but the interest rates have gone up, and their purchasing power has gone down,"" said Imelda Manzo, a Murrieta, California-based realtor who has been working on finding new housing for the Espinozas. Families of color are more likely to share a home with multiple generations, Pew found. Roughly a quarter of Asian, Black and Hispanic Americans each lived in multigenerational households in 2021, compared to 13% of those who are white.Residing with relatives can offer advantages: More family members residing under one roof means you can pool multiple streams of income, for instance. And in households with young children, grandparents can pitch in with child care.""Latinos are more likely to live in multigenerational households,"" said Gary Acosta, co-founder and CEO of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals.""But being a larger multigenerational family comes with complications if you're trying to be a homeowner,"" he said.  For instance, it can be harder for them to qualify for a mortgage, even if they bring multiple streams of income to the table. ""The perception is that those aren't permanent scenarios, so the instinct of the underwriter is to look at everything else more aggressively,"" Acosta said.Larger families also have needs to meet as they search for their dwellings, which make it hard to find the ideal home when inventory is tight. ""It's not just square footage, but do you have a yard, more bedrooms,"" Acosta said. ""You want more utility.""""Work-at-home growth pushed homebuyers to the suburbs and toward homes with more utility, such as extra bedrooms that can be used as a home office,"" Acosta said. Institutional buyers have also rushed into affordable neighborhoods to snap up homes, he added. Indeed, a May report from the National Association of Realtors found that in 2021 the institutional buyer market share rose in 84% of states, as well as in the District of Columbia.For the Espinoza family, the ideal home would have at least three bedrooms, a backyard and proximity to employment and schools in Santa Ana.These issues are also compounded by the fact that first-time homebuyers like the Espinozas have been facing fierce competition from all-cash buyers.""We would get counteroffers,"" said Manzo. ""[Sellers] would ask for highest and best within a deadline.""Aggressive bidders are also willing to up the ante to buy a home, including waiving inspections and appraisal contingencies, she said. And others just bring more cash to the table.In one situation, the family lost their bid on a home to another buyer who was willing to pay $125,000 over asking, Manzo added. As homeownership becomes increasingly unaffordable, different states are crafting legislation to address the problem.Last year, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the California Housing Opportunity and More Efficiency Act into law. The measure streamlines the process for homeowners to split their residential lot or build a duplex onto their property.The law also makes it easier for homeowners to build accessory dwelling units onto their property, said Acosta, which can also help accommodate multigenerational households. ""These additional units are typically called granny flats and can be used as an extra bedroom or it can be a small apartment inside of another property, so it increases density,"" he said.Another piece of proposed legislation in New Jersey would permit buyers bidding on foreclosed homes to make a down payment of 3.5%, provided they make that property their primary residence for at least seven years. Normally, buyers of these foreclosed properties would have to put down a deposit of 20%.For the Espinoza family, the next steps are to wait for the market to cool sufficiently — and to keep an eye on interest rates, even as the Fed continues its policy-tightening regime.""We've started to see some sellers are doing price reductions on their listing; they're not selling the way they were six months ago,"" Manzo said. ""We're in a waiting period right now, but we'll continue to look and see what happens toward the end of the year."""
2022-10-19,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has become the latest corporate leader to warn about the state of the economy, cautioning that rougher times are likely ahead.""Yep, the probabilities in this economy tell  you batten down the hatches,"" Bezos said in a comment related to Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon's CNBC interview. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has become the latest corporate leader to warn about the state of the economy, cautioning that rougher times are likely ahead.In a tweet posted Tuesday evening, the former president and CEO of the online retailing giant echoed comments that Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon made to CNBC earlier in the day.""Yep, the probabilities in this economy tell you batten down the hatches,"" Bezos said in a comment attached to a clip of Solomon's ""Squawk Box"" interview.Solomon, the head of the Wall Street financial giant, said it's time for both corporate leaders and investors to understand the risks building up, and to prepare accordingly.Solomon spoke after his firm had just posted quarterly earnings results that beat Wall Street estimates. Yet he said a recession could be looming as the economy deals with persistently high inflation and a Federal Reserve trying to lower prices through a series of aggressive interest rate increases.""I think you have to expect that there's more volatility on the horizon,"" Solomon said. ""Now, that doesn't mean for sure that we have a really difficult economic scenario. But on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States."" Fed officials have also been warning that a recession is possible as a result of the monetary policy tightening, though they hope to avoid a downturn. Policymakers in September estimated that gross domestic product would grow just 0.2% in 2022 and rebound in 2023, but to only 1.2%. GDP contracted in both the first and second quarters this year, meeting a commonly held definition of a recession.There have been mixed signals lately from corporate leaders.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been warning of troubles ahead, saying recently that the situation is ""very, very serious"" and that the U.S. could slip into recession in the next six months.However, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told CNBC on Monday that credit card data and related information show that consumer spending has held up.""In the current environment, the consumer is quite good and strong,"" he said on ""Closing Bell.""Moynihan acknowledged that the Fed's efforts could slow the economy, but noted that ""the consumer's hanging in there."""

2022-10-20," The third-quarter CNBC All-America Economic Survey finds some modest improvements in economic attitudes and in President Joe Biden's approval ratings across the country, but Americans still harbor mostly negative views on the economy and give the GOP double-digit leads on key economic and financial issues ahead of the November elections.Biden's overall approval rating improved 10 points from the July survey with 46% approving and 50% disapproving. Approval of Biden's handling of the economy also rose 10 points, with 40% approving and 56% disapproving. While they were the president's best numbers since 2021, the improvement came largely from increased Democratic support. Approval by independents on the economy remained unchanged from the prior poll at just 25%. Americans' views on the current state of the economy rose 5 points from the prior survey, yet still remain at a low level. Only 16% say the economy is excellent or good, up from 11% in July; 83% call the economy fair or poor, the third straight survey where the percentage has been above 80.On the outlook, 27% expect the economy to improve in the next year, up from 22% in July, with 45% expecting it to get worse, down from 52% in July. The 45% who believe the economy will worsen is the third most pessimistic result in the 14-year history of the survey, eclipsed only by the surveys in July and a year ago.Republicans have a 2-point advantage, 48%-46%, on party preference to control Congress. That's a toss-up with the poll's +/-3.5% margin for error, but Democrats have typically had substantial leads in this question when they have picked up congressional seats. The gap is the same as the prior survey, which came in at 44%-42%.The poll of 800 registered voters nationwide was conducted Oct. 13-16 by Hart Research, who served as the Democratic pollsters, and Public Opinion Strategies, the Republican pollsters. Republicans have a double-digit lead on the questions of which party would do a better job bringing down inflation, handling taxes, dealing with deficits and creating jobs. CNBC's Democratic and Republican pollsters agree the economic numbers look similar to 2014 when the GOP retained the House and took control of the Senate. ""We tested a number of economic issues and Republicans just kind of ran the table, all except for on the cost of health care,"" said Micah Roberts, partner at Public Opinion Strategies. ""If this election were just about the economy, which we know it's not, but if it were just about the economy, this would be a complete shellacking.""Specifically, on the issue of which party is best to control inflation, Republicans have a 15-point lead, 42-27%; they lead 40-29% on dealing with taxes; 36% to 25% on reducing the deficit; and 43 -33% on creating jobs. Democrats have a 4-point lead, 42% to 38%, on ""looking out for the middle class,"" but that's down from a 12-point margin they enjoyed in 2018. They have a commanding 44-28% margin on which party is best to reduce health-care costs.""The way things are moving overall and the way things look, it's definitely more of an uphill climb for Democrats and maybe slightly slanted downwards for Republicans,'' said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research.The poll also found:43% of American say higher interest rates have had a negative effect on their personal financial situation; 47% say they've been hurt by the stock market decline; and 77% say inflation has set them back financially.Just 32% believe their home price will increase in the next year, the lowest level since the Covid pandemic began; 23% believe their home price will decline in the next year, the highest level since 2011.Views on the stock market remain depressed — just a point above the worst levels ever recorded in the survey — with just 28% saying it's a good time to invest in the stock market.68% think the U.S. will soon be in a recession, including 9% who believe we are already in a recession.The one bit of good economic news: 41% believe their wages will rise in the next year, the highest level since the pandemic.Inflation ranks as the No. 1 concern for all Americans combined, but there are substantial differences by party. ""Threats to democracy"" is the No. 1 issues for Democrats, and ""immigration and border security"" is tops for Republicans, a point ahead of inflation. For independents, inflation is the leading concern and little else registers. Crime is the No. 3 issue for GOP voters, while abortion and climate change are tied for third among Democrats. For the moment, the war in Ukraine and jobs and unemployment are not seen as top issues by either party or independents.Americans have less confidence in the Federal Reserve than they do Republicans or Democrats in Congress. Just 15% of the public say they have confidence in the Fed, compared with 22% for Republicans and 21% for Democrats in Congress. A 53% majority say the Fed's efforts to reduce inflation by raising interest rates will succeed. But when asked what's more important when it comes to the central bank's dual mandate — jobs or inflation — Americans are split. 47% say it's more important to protect jobs than fight inflation and 43% say the inflation fight should take precedence.(Download the full survey here.)"
2022-10-20,"A vast majority of CEOs believe we're headed toward a recession and are cutting staff, sustainability efforts and diversity budgets to prepare for a downturn.Some 91% of U.S. CEOs are ""convinced"" a recession is on its way in the next 12 months, according to a KPMG survey of 1,325 CEOs between July 12 and August 24, 2022. And the top ways they're preparing for a downturn are to pause or reconsider efforts around ESG — or environmental, social and governance (59%) — and downsize their employee base (51%).Both strategies could spell trouble for long-term success, says Paul Knopp, U.S. chair and CEO at the professional services firm KPMG.For one, executives can't respond to a recession they did in 2020 by conducting mass layoffs and expecting consumer demand to stay depressed. What's more, cuts to ESG initiatives that customers and employees like — ones that prioritize sustainability, diversity and social progress — could backfire in the long run. Executives should be ""very cautious"" about how they approach layoffs, Knopp says, adding that today's imbalanced hiring market was made worse by how leaders responded during the early pandemic downturn.By early 2021, ""the economy bounced back incredibly fast, and those leaders that cut jobs probably regret it to some degree,"" he says. As hiring became more competitive, employers had to raise wages, add benefits and improve job conditions in order to get people in the door.Other conditions are leading to shortages of workers, Knopp adds: retiring Baby Boomers, falling college enrollment, limiting immigration policies, and employees dropping out of the workforce due to long Covid, child-care needs and other reasons.Knopp says CEOs should be strategic in their cuts and be prepared for another quick rebound by mid-2023. According to the survey, while more than half of CEOs are considering downsizing their workforce over the next six months, 92% expect their company headcount to increase in the next three years.He expects leaders will continue to feel pressure around offering good pay, benefits and working conditions: 73% of CEOs say they're concerned about their ability to retain talent due to rising inflation and cost of living factors. Budget cuts to ESG efforts could cause employers to fall out of favor with financiers, customers and employees in the long run, too. Executives in recent years have recognized that conducting climate-friendly and socially progressive business can be profitable: 70% of U.S. CEOs surveyed this year say ESG improves financial performance, compared to 37% last year, according to KPMG.If leaders go off-course too much with their goals, they risk losing out on access to capital from financial stakeholders who want to see improved corporate ESG efforts, they could fall out of favor with customers who bolster profits, and they could lose a competitive hiring edge over job-seekers.As a result, CEOs reducing spending on these efforts should consider ""tapping the brakes"" rather than putting it up on the chopping block, Knopp says.""CEOs recognize they have to walk the talk"" around net-zero climate commitments and improvements to their social agenda around diversity, equity and inclusion, Knopp says. ""Customers are making buying decisions around those commitments"" and employees ""want to see us be more diverse and inclusive,"" he adds. ""It's all about measured reduction in the short-term but commitments for the long-term."" Business leaders should also approach budget cuts knowing how job and financial insecurity could worsen workers' burnout.Already, CEOs said pandemic-related fatigue is the most pressing concern for their organization today, and 76% believe they need to address burnout from fast-tracked digital transformation over the past two years before they can introduce new growth initiatives to get past the recession.Meanwhile, some employers have cut back on employee resources that grew out of pandemic distress, like Covid sick days and parental leave. Knopp says continued cuts in these areas from a larger swath of employers would be the wrong move.New uncertainty around a potential recession and job reductions adds another level of stress, and ""people feel burned out as it is,"" Knopp says. With more instability on the way, ""I expect employers will continue to enhance emotional and physical wellbeing programs and think about additional stresses coming into sight as we move forward.""Check out:86% of Gen Z interns think a recession is coming—and it's changing their approach to their careersHow Gen Z is rewriting dating, marriage and family plans for their 20sRemote work could keep fueling high turnover: 'The map is open for job seekers'Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"

President Joe Biden predicted Friday that voters will swing back to favor Democrats in the remaining weeks before the midterm elections as concerns over the economy ease.""Back and forth, with them ahead, us ahead, them ahead, back and forth. The polls have been all over the place,"" Biden said, speaking at the White House. ""I think that we're going to see one more shift back to our side in the closing days.""Democrats hope to hold their majorities in both chambers of Congress for the final two years of Biden's first term. The party is clinging to a small majority in the House, and holds the slimmest possible edge in a 50-50 Senate.Polls have recently favored Republicans as concerns over the economy have eclipsed abortion. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Monday found voters favor Republican control of Congress by a margin of 4 percentage points.The gap, which fell within the survey's margin of error, marked a shift from a month ago, when Democrats were favored to control Congress.The poll found economic topics like the stock market and jobs were voters' top issues, as 26% said it was their biggest concern, followed by inflation at 18% and abortion and immigration each with 5%.Approval for Biden generally and his handling of the economy rose in the third quarter, according to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey released Thursday, with each improving 10 percentage points from the last poll in July. The survey found respondents favored Republicans over Democrats to control Congress by a 2 percentage point margin. The advantage fell within the survey's 3.5 percentage point margin of error.The CNBC survey also found Republicans scored higher on voter preference for economic issues, with double-digit leads on the questions of who would do a better job bringing down inflation, handling taxes, dealing with deficits and creating jobs.But Biden, speaking about the federal deficit's drop to $1.38 trillion in fiscal year 2022 from the 2021 deficit of $2.78 trillion as pandemic-era spending fell, stressed the economic tides were shifting.""Let me tell you why,"" Biden said.

Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk thinks the global economic decline could last for another year and a half.In a Twitter exchange early Friday morning Eastern time, the mercurial electric car executive and world's richest man said a recession could continue ""until spring of '24.""The remarks came in response to a tweet from Shibetoshi Nakamoto, the online name for Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, who noted that current coronavirus numbers ""are actually pretty low. i [sic] guess all we have to worry about now is the impending global recession and nuclear apocalypse.""""It sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event,"" Musk replied.Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a Twitter account with nearly 600,000 followers, then asked Musk how long he thought the recession would last, to which he replied, ""Just guessing, but probably until spring of '24.""Global GDP grew 6% in 2021 but is expected to decelerate to 3.2% this year and 2.7% in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund. That would mark the weakest pace of growth since 2001 outside of the financial crisis in 2008 and the brief plunge in the early days of the Covid pandemic. The Federal Reserve projects GDP in the U.S. to grow just 0.2% this year and 1.2% in 2023.Musk becomes the latest corporate titan to express reservations about the economy.In a tweet Wednesday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said it's time to ""batten down the hatches"" in preparation for rough economic waters ahead. That tweet accompanied a video of Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who said in a CNBC interview that he thinks there's a ""good chance"" of a recession in the U.S.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also has been warning of economic turmoil ahead.Musk's comment also came amid a rough week for Tesla stock as the automaker missed revenue estimates and cautioned about a potential delivery shortfall this year.During the analyst call, Musk expressed more confidence in the U.S. economy than other parts of the world. He also noted the impact that interest rate increases are having on the economy.""The U.S. actually is in — North America's in pretty good health,"" he said. ""A little bit of that is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they'll eventually realize that and bring back down, I think.""However, he said China is in ""quite a burst of a recession of sorts"" driven by the real estate market, while Europe ""has a recession of sorts, driven by energy.""Correction: A previous version of this article misstated past GDP growth."
2022-10-24,"While there is a growing chorus of voices who say that the Federal Reserve should slow or halt its rate increases, JPMorgan President Daniel Pinto is not in that camp.""I think putting inflation back in a box is very important,"" Pinto told CNBC in an interview. ""If it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time, that is the price we have to pay.""""I don't think we've seen the bottom of the market yet,"" he said, adding that corporate earnings expectations were still too high. Pinto, who leads the world's biggest investment bank by revenue, called cryptocurrencies a small asset class that is ""kind of irrelevant"" at the moment.  JPMorgan Chase President Daniel Pinto has vivid memories of what life is like when a country loses control of inflation.As a child growing up in Argentina, Pinto, 59, said that inflation was often so high, prices for food and other goods spiked on an hourly basis. Workers could lose 20% of their salary if they didn't rush to convert their paycheck into U.S. dollars, he said.""Supermarkets had these armies of people using machines to relabel products, sometimes 10 to 15 times a day,"" Pinto said. ""At the end of the day, they had to remove all the labels and start over again the next day.""The experiences of Pinto, a Wall Street veteran who runs the world's biggest investment bank by revenue, informs his views at a key time for markets and the economy.After unleashing trillions of dollars in support of households and businesses in 2020, the Federal Reserve is grappling with inflation at four-decade highs by raising rates and pulling back on its debt-buying programs. The moves have cratered stocks and bonds this year and rippled around the world as a surging dollar complicates other nations' own battles with inflation.Living with pervasive inflation was ""very, very stressful"" and is especially hard on low-income families, Pinto said in a recent interview from JPMorgan's New York headquarters. Price increases averaged more than 300% a year in Argentina from 1975 to 1991. While there is a growing chorus of voices who say the Federal Reserve should slow or halt its rate increases amid some signs of price moderation, Pinto is not in that camp.""That's why when people say, `the Fed is too hawkish,' I disagree,"" said Pinto, who became JPMorgan's sole president and chief operating officer earlier this year, solidifying his status as CEO Jamie Dimon's top lieutenant and potential successor.""I think putting inflation back in a box is very important,"" he said. ""If it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time, that is the price we have to pay."" The Fed can't allow inflation to become ingrained in the economy, according to the executive. A premature return to easier monetary policy risks repeating the mistakes of the '70s and '80s, he said.That's why he thinks it's more likely the Fed errs on the side of being aggressive on rates. The fed funds rate will probably peak at around 5%; that, along with a rise in unemployment, will likely curb inflation, Pinto said. The rate is currently in a 3% to 3.25% range. Like a string of other executives have said recently, including Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, the U.S. faces a recession because of the Fed's predicament, Pinto said. The only question is how severe the slowdown will be. That, of course, is being reflected in the markets that Pinto watches daily.""We're dealing with a market that is pricing the probability of recession and how deep it's going to be,"" Pinto said.The economic situation this year has been unlike any other in recent history; apart from booming price increases for goods and services, corporate earnings have been relatively resilient, confusing investors looking for signs of a slowdown.But profit estimates haven't fallen far enough to reflect what's coming, according to Pinto, and that could mean the market takes another leg down. The S&P 500 has dropped 21% this year as of Friday.""I don't think we've seen the bottom of the market yet,"" Pinto said. ""When you think about corporate earnings heading into next year, expectations may still be too elevated; multiples in some equity markets including the S&P are probably a bit high."" Still, despite higher volatility that he expects to remain, Pinto said the markets have been functioning ""better than I was expecting."" With the notable exception of the collapse in U.K. government bonds, known as ""gilts,"" that led to the resignation of that country's prime minister last week, markets have been orderly, he said.That could change if the Ukraine war takes a perilous new turn, or tensions with China over Taiwan spill onto the global stage, upending progress on supply chains, among other potential pitfalls. Markets have become more fragile in some ways because post-2008 crisis reforms forced banks to hold more capital tied to trading, which makes markets more likely to seize up during periods of great volatility.""Geopolitics is the big black swan on the horizon that hopefully doesn't play out,"" Pinto said.Even after central banks get a handle on inflation, its likely that interest rates will be higher in the future than they were in the past decade and a half, he said. Low or even negative rates around the world have been the defining characteristic of the previous era.That low-rate regime has punished savers and benefited borrowers and riskier companies who could continue to tap debt markets. It also led to a wave of investment in private companies, including the fintech firms taking on JPMorgan and its peers, and supercharged the stock of tech companies as investors paid up for growth.""Real rates should be higher in the next 20 years than they were in the last 20 years,"" Pinto said. ""Nothing crazy, but higher, and that affects many things like the valuations of growth companies."" The post-financial crisis era also gave rise to new forms of digital money: cryptocurrencies including bitcoin. While JPMorgan and rivals including Morgan Stanley and others have allowed wealth management clients to get exposure to crypto, there appears to be little progress recently in terms of its institutional adoption, according to Pinto.""The reality is, the current form of crypto has become a small asset class that is kind of irrelevant in the scheme of things,"" he said. ""But the technology, the concepts, something is probably going to happen there; just not in its current form.""As for the broader economy, there are reasons for optimism amid the gloom.Households and businesses have strong balance sheets, which should cushion the pain of a downturn. There is far less leverage lurking in the regulated banking system than in 2008, and higher mortgage standards should result in a less punishing default cycle this time.""Things that triggered problems in the past are in a far better position now,"" Pinto said. ""That said, you hope nothing new pops up."""

2022-10-25,"U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh said in an interview at the CNBC Work Summit that he does not expect mass layoffs and job growth should continue into next year.But Walsh said that immigration reform, supported by every business owner he talks to, will be critical to the national workforce and without it, a 'bigger catastrophe' than a recession or inflation is coming.Walsh also offered views on a federal minimum wage increase, federal childcare support and gig worker rules reform seen as targeting Uber and Lyft.  There has been a lot of talk about looming layoffs, and by some recent surveying, as many as half of large employers are thinking about labor cost cuts as the economy slows. But U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Marty Walsh doesn't see the recent job gains reversing, according to an interview at CNBC's Work Summit on Tuesday.""I still think that we're going to have job gains as we move into the end of this year, early next year. A lot of people are still looking at different jobs,"" he told CNBC's Kayla Tausche at the virtual event. ""We saw a lot of moving around over this last course of the year. People leaving jobs, getting better jobs, and I'm not convinced yet that we're headed towards that.""For the Federal Reserve, some level of higher unemployment is necessary to cool an economy that has been bedeviled by persistent inflation. Unemployment, at 3.5% now, went down in the last monthly nonfarm payrolls report. The Fed is targeting unemployment of 4.4% as a result of its policy and higher interest rates.""We definitely have to bring down inflationary pressures,"" Walsh said at the CNBC Work Summit, but he added that the way to do it isn't layoffs.A House inquiry released on Tuesday found that the 12 largest employers in the nation including Walmart and Disney laid off more than 100,000 workers in the most recent recession during the pandemic.Walsh said in a slower economy, the federal government's infrastructure act will support job growth in sectors including transportation. ""Those monies are there. ... if we did have a downturn in the economy, those jobs will keep people working through a difficult time.""In the battle against inflation, Walsh said moving people up the income ladder is a better way of helping Americans make ends meet than laying them off.""I think there's a way to do that by creating good opportunities for people so they have opportunities to get into the middle class, and not enough people in America are working in those jobs, quite honestly. ... I think there's a lot of Americans out there right now that have gone through the last two years, a lot of concern in the pandemic, they were working in a job maybe making minimum wage, maybe they had two or three jobs. Really I think the best way to describe what is a middle class job is a job you can work, one job, get good pay, so you don't have to work two and three jobs to support your family.""From a policy perspective, Walsh expressed disbelief that a higher federal minimum wage remains a contentious issue on Capitol Hill.""It shocks me that there are members in the building behind me, if you can't see the building behind me it's the Capitol, that think that families can raise their family on $7-plus, on the minimum wage in this country,"" he said.But Walsh conceded that legislation to increase the minimum wage, which was held up in the Senate, has an uncertain future ahead of the midterm elections.Here are a few of the other major policy issues the Labor Secretary weighed in on at the CNBC Work Summit. Amid one of the tightest labor markets in history, Walsh said the political parties' approach to immigration — ""getting immigration all tied up"" — is among the most consequential mistakes the nation can make in labor policy.""One party is showing pictures of the border and meanwhile if you talk to businesses that support those congressional folks, they're saying we need immigration reform,"" Walsh said. ""Every place I've gone in the country and talked to every major business, every small business, every single one of them is saying we need immigration reform. We need comprehensive immigration reform. They want to create a pathway for citizenship into our country, and they want to create better pathways for visas in our country.""The demographic data on the U.S. working age population is concerning, with baby boomer retirements expected to accelerate in the years ahead, compounded by a peak being reached in high school graduates by 2025, limiting both the total size of the next generation labor pool and the transfer of knowledge between the generations of workers.""We need a bipartisan fix here,"" Walsh said. ""I'll tell you right now if we don't solve immigration ... we're talking about worrying about recessions, we're talking about inflation. I think we're going to have a bigger catastrophe if we don't get more workers into our society and we do that by immigration."" A proposed DoL rule on independent contractors hit the shares of gig economy companies including Uber and Lyft a few weeks ago. The rulemaking is still in review and seeking public comments, and some Wall Street pundits don't expect it to have a significant impact on the rideshare companies.Walsh wouldn't even say if they are a target of the rulemaking.""We haven't necessarily said what companies are affected by it, and what businesses are affected by it. What we're looking at is people that are employees that are working for companies that are being taken advantage of as independent contractors. We want to end that,"" Walsh said. He did mention a few of the jobs that would likely be covered, and one of those does overlap with the Uber, Lyft and DoorDash business models. ""We have plenty of businesses in this country, like dishwashers and delivery drivers in areas like that, where people are working for a business that other employees in that business are employees, and they're labeling them as independent contractors. So we're going to look at this. We're in the rulemaking process now. We're taking in the comments now, and we'll see when the comments come in what the final rule looks like.""Walsh added that the idea an independent contractor want to retain their flexibility doesn't wash with him. ""Flexibility is not an excuse ... pay somebody as an employee. You can't use that as an excuse.""  Walsh, a union-book carrier, said that the public support for unions should be matched by actual gains in union ranks in the next two years. The most recent survey available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that labor jobs decreased by more than 240,000 in 2021, even as U.S. public support for unionization has surged and major brands including Apple, Amazon, and Starbucks face a rising tide of unionization at stores and in operations like warehouses, albeit still on the margins as far as total numbers of workers they employ.""I don't have the number of 2022, but 2021 was a unique year,"" Walsh said. ""The numbers went down in a lot of ways because companies' unions weren't organizing, number one, and number two, we had a pandemic and a lot of people retired, left their business or they retired. Those jobs weren't backfilled by companies. ... It's like 65%, 70% of Americans still looking favorably upon unions ... the highest in 50 years. I don't think you'll see the benefit of that organizing until probably 2023, 2024.""Other recent polling has found that public support for unions is higher than union member support for their own labor organizations. President Biden promised on the campaign trail to do more on child care; promised to include it in the infrastructure act; promised to include it in a second act after dropping it from the core infrastructure package; and then it was dropped from that back-up plan.Walsh said the government has to make good on that promise for families and workers in the child-care sector.""Childcare is a basic necessity to get millions of women back into the workforce on a full-time basis,"" he said.The recent Women in the Workplace study from McKinsey and LeanIn.org finds that women are still opting out of the workforce in large numbers, a reversal of labor market gains that began during the pandemic.""Child care has not been addressed by this country or by most states in this country for the last 50 years. The cost is too high for the average family and we can't retain the workers in those industries. We lost a lot of workers in the childcare industry because they're paying them minimum wage or a little bit above minimum wage,"" Walsh said, referring to estimates that 100,000 workers left the sector during the pandemic.""We have to respect them and pay them better wages. Anyone watching today that has kids in child care, you know, you're paying 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% of your salary for child care,"" he said. ""A lot of families have made the decision [that], 'We don't want to have two people working, one person will maybe stay home, work part time and make up those costs,' so that issue has to be resolved. It's not just an economic issue. It's a human rights issue in our country to get good child care,"" he added."
2022-10-25,"Britain's new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took office Tuesday, assuming with it one of the most daunting political inboxes in modern British history.The former finance minister will be tasked with remedying multiple crises, including soaring inflation, higher energy costs, industrial unrest and a battered economy.Sunak has warned that the U.K. faces a ""profound economic challenge,"" and pledged to instill ""stability and unity."" LONDON — Britain's new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak assumed office Tuesday and, with it, one of the most daunting political inboxes in modern British history as he attempts to steer the country through an existing cost-of-living crisis, political and social disjuncture, and a looming recession.The former finance minister was named leader of the Conservative Party — and therefore the country's next prime minister — on Monday, after his sole competitor, Penny Mordaunt, pulled out of the leadership race moments before the nominations deadline.related investing newsOur conviction in Morgan Stanley remains solid, despite the CEO's planned departure Kevin Stankiewicz21 hours agoThe 42-year-old was officially installed in the role Tuesday morning by King Charles III, whom he met at Buckingham Palace after outgoing Prime Minister Liz Truss formally tendered her resignation to the monarch.Sunak's officiation is momentous not least in that it marks Downing Street's first prime minister of color and the U.K.'s youngest leader of modern times. It is also King Charles' first swearing in of a new government, coming just seven weeks after his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, appointed Truss, who resigned 44 days later.But also because it comes at a time of profound political and economic crisis for the country, with the challenges in Sunak's office in-tray spanning economic instability, soaring inflation, stretched public finances, industrial unrest and party politics from day one. Sunak has so far given little away about his plans once in office, ascending to the top job virtually in silence following a fast-tracked leadership race over the weekend.However, as a former finance minister who steered Britain through the Covid-19 pandemic, recovering the U.K.'s embattled economy and the country's status among the investment community is likely to be a top priority. In his inaugural speech as prime minister Tuesday, Sunak said the challenges facing the country were ""profound"" and pledged to place ""economic stability"" at the center of his agenda.""Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis,"" Sunak said outside Downing Street.""Some mistakes were made,"" he continued, referencing to the prior government of Liz Truss. ""I have been elected as leader of my party and your prime minister, in part, to fix them. And that work begins immediately.""""I will place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda. This will mean difficult decisions to come,"" he added. It is expected that Sunak will retain the current Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt, who is credited with calming markets following the Truss government's cataclysmic mini-budget, and who is due to set out the country's revised fiscal strategy Monday.Economists said that could go some way in reasserting the U.K.'s economic stability, but added that investors will be closely watching the forthcoming budget to see exactly how the pair plan to fill a gaping £40 billion ($45 billion) in the public finances.""If the fiscal rules are too loose and/or the policies announced to fill the fiscal hole are considered unachievable, this won't rebuild credibility with investors,"" Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note Monday. Still, while Sunak is seen as having safer fiscal hands than his predecessor, investors have warned that any relief rally in financial markets may be short-lived, as the new government has a long way to go in resolving the country's wider economic ills.The U.K. is the only G-7 economy not to have re-attained its pre-pandemic GDP level by the second quarter of 2022. Indeed, the economy shrank by 0.3% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics, with some ratings agencies predicting the U.K. is already in a full-year recession. It comes as the U.K. faces a labor crunch and continued industrial unrest, with widespread strikes among postal workers, rail workers and public barristers having led to months of disruption.Meanwhile, U.K. inflation returned to a 40-year high of 10.1% in September, and energy prices continue to push higher following Russia's war in Ukraine, with some energy providers warning of possible blackouts this winter.""The U.K. still faces a storm of economic problems,"" Nigel Green, CEO, deVere Group, said in a note Monday. ""There's the brewing deep and painful recession, soaring energy prices, inflation running at more than 10%, labor gaps, ongoing supply chain dramas, and the Bank of England intent on hiking interest rates."" Sunak's task as prime minister is further complicated by deep-rooted divisions within the ruling Conservative Party.Despite winning significant backing from Tory members of parliament, Sunak is considered a divisive figure within the party, and was largely blamed for the demise of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after he quit as his finance minister. Sunak's success will therefore closely depend on his ability to galvanize his party and unite them under his new economic and political vision.Closely watched over the coming days will be Sunak's appointment of his cabinet, which will provide him an opportunity to overhaul the top ranks of the party and appoint a broad church of ministers from across Tory factions.The U.K.'s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told Sky News Tuesday that Sunak's government should feature the best ministers available — rather than focusing on those who are loyal — as Truss was criticized for doing.""We have got to have the first 15 on the pitch. I know that Rishi understands that,"" Cleverly said."

""Mr Li suffered some setbacks during the Omicron wave in spring this year, when the entire city of Shanghai was put under a restrictive full lockdown. However, during most of 2020 and 2021, Shanghai under Mr Li's governorship was perceived as a role model for achieving a reasonable balance between Covid containment and economic growth.""Analysts also pointed out the promotions of He Lifeng, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, and securities regulator head Yi Huiman.He Lifeng will likely ""succeed the retiring Liu He as vice premier and director of the party's Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission,"" Teneo analysts said. ""Though He lacks Liu's technocratic expertise, He's record also suggests a strong focus on economic growth,"" the report said. ""In an article last year, He wrote that economic development was the 'number one task' and the foundation and key to solving all our country's problems.'""Xi's speech at the opening of the Chinese Communist Party's 20th National Congress this month emphasized that China will focus on ""high-quality development"" and ""modernization"" in the coming years.Common prosperity — moderate wealth for all, rather than just a few — is a requirement for that modernization, Xi said.

The restrictions on business activity have weighed on economic growth.However, Bank of America China and Asia Economist Helen Qiao and a team said in a note Monday that Covid policy changes could happen sooner than the market expects. ""In our view, the completion of the [party congress] will enable the top leadership to move on to the next policy agenda soon — relaxing the Covid curbs,"" the report said.The analysts said some might worry about the new group of leaders' lack of checks and balances, and the risk of policy mistakes that shock the economy.But they added that the group's solidarity ""may lead to more effective policy execution"" for the country overall.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report."
2022-10-26,"The ECB is widely seen raising rates by 75 basis points later this week. This would be the second consecutive jumbo hike and the third increase this year.Rates aside, there are two questions on the minds of market players. While the European Central Bank is largely expected to announce another rate hike Thursday, market players are seemingly more concentrated on two other policy tools as the region edges toward a recession.The central bank has been contemplating inflation being at record highs but an economy that is slowing, with many economists predicting a recession before the end of the year. If the ECB takes a very aggressive stance in increasing rates to deal with inflation, there are risks that it tips the economy into further trouble.Amid this context, the ECB is widely seen raising rates by 75 basis points later this week. This would be the second consecutive jumbo hike and the third increase this year.""The ECB will likely raise its three policy rates by 75 basis points and suggest that it will go further at its next few policy meetings without providing a clear guidance on the size and number of steps to come,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, said in a note Tuesday.Given the inflationary pressures — the September inflation rate came in at 10% — analysts are pricing in at least another 50 basis point hike in December. The bank's main rate is currently at 0.75%.""A growing consensus seems to be in favour of having the deposit rate at 2% by the end of the year, implying a 50 basis point hike in December, with a reassessment of the economic and inflation outlook in early 2023,"" Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management, said in a note Friday. Rates aside, there are two questions on the minds of market players that need answering: When will the ECB start unwinding its balance sheet, in a process known as quantitative tightening, and what will happen to the lending conditions for banks in the near future. The ECB has undertaken years of quantitative easing, where it buys assets like government bonds to simulate demand, following the euro crisis of 2011 and the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020.""When it comes to QT, boring is beautiful,"" Ducrozet said, adding that he expects the process to start in the second quarter of 2023. QT is expected ""to be predictable, gradual, and passive, starting with the end of reinvestments under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) but not actively selling bonds any time soon,"" he said.Camille De Courcel, head of European rates strategy at BNP Paribas, said in a note Monday that the central bank might wait until the December meeting to provide details on QT but that it is likely to start reducing its balance sheet by about 28 billion euros on average per month when it does happen. But perhaps the biggest uncertainty at this stage is whether lending conditions will change for European banks.""We think Thursday [the ECB] will unveil a decision on the TLTRO, either its remuneration, or its cost. We think the new measure will only come into effect, in December,"" De Courcel said.The targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTROs, is a tool that provides European banks with attractive borrowing conditions — hopefully giving these institutions more incentives to lend to the real economy.Because the ECB has been increasing rates faster than the central bank initially expected, European lenders are benefiting from the attractive loan rates via TLTROs while also making more money from the higher interest rates.""The optics are bad against the backdrop of a historical shock to households' income, and political pressure cannot be ignored,"" Ducrozet said.The euro traded marginally higher against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday at $0.997. The weakness of the common currency has been a concern for the central bank though it repeatedly states that it does not target the exchange rate."
2022-10-26,"Sen. Sherrod Brown this week sent a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, expressing concern about the impact interest rate hikes could have on employment.""Potential job losses brought about by monetary over-tightening will only worsen these matters for the working class,"" the Ohio Democrat said.The last time the Fed raised interest rates, from 2016 to December 2018, Powell withstood withering criticism from former President Donald Trump.Powell has in the past been generally dismissive when asked if political pressure can factor into decision making. Political questioning of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about the central bank's policy moves is intensifying, this time from the other side of the aisle.No stranger to political pressure, the Fed chief this week found himself the focus of concern in a letter from Sen. Sherrod Brown. The Ohio Democrat warned in the letter about potential job losses from the Fed's rate hikes that it is using to combat inflation.""It is your job to combat inflation, but at the same time you must not lose sight of your responsibility to ensure that we have full employment,"" Brown wrote. He added that ""potential job losses brought about by monetary over-tightening will only worsen these matters for the working class.""The letter comes with the Fed less than a week away from its two-day policy meeting that is widely expected to conclude Nov. 2 with a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase. That would take the central bank's benchmark funds rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%, its highest level since early 2008 and represents the fastest pace of policy tightening since the early 1980s.Without recommending a specific course of action, Brown asked Powell to remember the Fed has a two-pronged mandate — low inflation as well as full employment — and requested that ""the decisions you make at the next FOMC meeting reflect your commitment to the dual mandate.""

Brown's stance was considerably more nuanced than Trump's — though equally unlikely to move the dial on monetary policy.""Chair Powell has made it pretty clear that the necessary conditions for the Fed to achieve its full employment objective is low and stable inflation. Without low and stable inflation, there's no way to achieve full employment,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. ""He'll stick to his guns on this. I don't see this as having any material impact on decision making at the Fed.""To be sure, while it's most likely a reaction to a changing tone from some Fed officials and a slight shift in the economic data, market expectations for monetary policy have altered a bit. Traders have made peace with the three-quarter point hike next week. But they now see just a 36% chance for another such move at December's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, after earlier rating it a near 80% probability, according to CME Group data.That change in sentiment has come following cautionary remarks about overly aggressive policies from several Fed officials, including Vice Chairman Lael Brainard and San Francisco regional President Mary Daly. In remarks late last week, Daly said she's looking for a ""step-down"" point where the Fed can slow the pace of its rate moves.""The democratization of the Fed is the issue for the market, how much power the other members have versus the chairman. It's difficult to know,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. Regarding Brown's letter, Krosby said, ""I don't think it's going to affect him. … It's not the pressure coming from the politicians, which is to be expected.""A Fed spokesman acknowledged that Powell received the Brown letter and said normal policy is to respond to such communication directly. In the past, Powell has been generally dismissive when asked if political pressure can factor into decision making. Along with the nudging from Brown, Powell also has faced criticism from others on Capitol Hill.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ultra-progressive Massachusetts Democrat and former presidential contender, has called Powell dangerous and recently also warned about the impact rate hikes could have on employment. Also, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., last year criticized Powell for what was seen as the Fed's flat-footed response to the early rise of inflation.""I don't necessarily think that Powell will buckle to the political pressure, but I'm wondering whether some of his colleagues start to, some of the doves who have become hawkish,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. ""Employment's fine now, but as months go on and growth continues to slow and layoffs begin to increase at a more notable pace, I have to believe that the level of pressure is going to grow.""Payroll gains have been strong all years, but a number of companies have said they are either putting a freeze on hiring or cutting back as economic conditions soften. A slowing economy and stubbornly high inflation is making the backdrop difficult for the November elections, where Democrats are expected to lose control of the House and possibly the Senate.With the high stakes in mind, both markets and lawmakers will be listening closely to Powell's post-meeting news conference next Wednesday, which will come six days before the election.""He knows the pressure. He knows that the politicians are increasingly nervous about losing their seats,"" Krosby said. ""There's very little he could do at this point, by the way, to help either party."""

The White House is working to assure voters President Joe Biden is doing everything he can to lower the cost of living with just two weeks until Election Day as polls increasingly show the economy as a top concern for Americans.Flanked by CFPB Director Rohit Chopra and FTC Chair Lina Khan at the White House Wednesday, Biden announced initiatives to address ""junk fees"" from banks, airlines, cable companies and other industries. Junk fees are surprise costs added to consumer bills.The speech was billed as ""remarks on new actions to provide families with more breathing room.""""One of the things that I think frustrates the American people is they know the world's in a bit of a disarray,"" Biden said Wednesday. ""They know that Putin's war has put an awful lot of strains on Europe and the rest of the world and the United States — everything from blocking grain shipments to oil. And they want to know: What are we doing? And there's a lot going on that we're doing. It adds up.""Democrats are under pressure to show they are addressing inflation before the midterm elections on Nov. 8. In recent weeks voters increasingly rank the economy and inflation as their top concern in polls, outpacing the abortion issue and threats to democracy. Polls show voters tend to favor Republicans on economic issues.A big talking point for Republicans is gas prices. Biden has been focused on lowering the price at the pump, frequently highlighting how the average price of gas in the United States has dropped from its peak of over $5 a gallon in June.""We're making serious progress in getting prices close to what they were before the pandemic,"" Biden said. ""I'm going to be working very hard to make sure that oil companies pass on the reduction in the price of a barrel of oil to the pump.""The Biden administration's latest initiative, reducing ""junk fees,"" has been months in the making as regulatory agency's pressure or outright order companies to disclose or eliminate myriad fees, he said. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rolled out new guidance Wednesday prohibiting banks from charging surprise overdraft fees on debit transactions and fees on deposits that later bounce.""And we're just getting started,"" he said, adding that there are tens of billions of dollars in junk fees across industries that he's directed his administration to reduce or eliminate. The Federal Trade Commission started work last week on cracking down ""on unfair and deceptive fees across all industries — fees that were never disclosed ... and there was no way to avoid the fee,"" Biden said.He cited processing fees for concert tickets, ""resort fees"" at hotels, ""excessive"" credit card late fees, airline booking fees and termination charges to keep consumers from switching cable or internet plans as some of the fees the administration is tackling.These are ""surprise charges the companies sneak in the bills because they can,"" he said.Airlines have added numerous fees over the past decade, such as preferred seating fees that don't come with extra legroom. Major carriers have also introduced basic economy tickets, no frills fares that are less flexible than standard economy fares. The Biden administration's proposal is already receiving pushback from carriers.Delta Air Lines earlier this month said customers already have access to fees and prices and that it plans to file a formal comment on the proposal. ""They're expecting a carrier to provide at moment of making the search every single potential fee or price without regard to who's actually searching,"" Peter Carter, Delta's chief legal officer said on the Oct. 13 call. ""So it may be a fee that's not relevant to the consumer, which, of course, could create quite a bit of confusion for consumers.""Chopra, who spoke at the press conference, said bank overdraft and bounced check fees were ""likely unfair and unlawful."" Biden said the move would ""immediately start saving Americans collectively billions of dollars in unfair fees"" and hold corporations accountable.""My administration is also making it clear surprise overdraft fees are illegal,"" Biden said.— CNBC reporters Sarah O'Brien and Leslie Josephs contributed to this story."

2022-10-28,"U.S. gross domestic product grew by 2.6% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated Thursday. That growth follows a shrinking economy in the first half of the year.But consumers shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security, according to economists and financial advisors.  The U.S. economy grew in the third quarter, reversing a negative trend from the first half of the year — but weakness looms under the surface and households shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of financial security, economists and financial advisors said.""I think investors should still continue to be cautious ... and plan for more disruption,"" said Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California, and a member of CNBC's Advisor Council.related investing newsGet paid for doing nothing: What you should know about cash sweep accountsDarla Mercado, CFP®a day agoGross domestic product — a sum of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. — grew by 0.6% from July through September, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated Thursday. That figure amounts to 2.6% growth on an annualized basis.""For the U.S. economy, a developed economy, that's very respectable, slightly above average,"" said John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult, a data research company. That GDP expansion marks a rebound from a deceleration in both Q1 and Q2. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth meets the common definition of a recession — though the National Bureau of Economic Research, generally considered the arbiter of downturns, hasn't officially declared one.Nonetheless, many economists don't expect the recent growth to persist.The headline growth in Q3 was driven by non-domestic factors, like an increase in exports overseas, Leer said. But the U.S. can't depend on strong global demand to continue, due partly to a strong dollar, which makes U.S. products more costly to buy, as well as economic challenges in Europe, an ongoing slowdown in China, and high food and energy prices globally, Leer added. He also pointed to a slowdown in residential and non-residential fixed investment, which includes things like homebuilding and construction of commercial buildings and warehouses.And consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the U.S. economy, ""slowed to its weakest pace since the first quarter when spending first hit a wall in response to soaring inflation,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, wrote in a tweet.""Bottom Line: This may be the strongest and only positive print on GDP growth we see for a while,"" Swonk wrote. ""Bundle up for what looks to be a chilly winter.""And there are concerns beyond some underlying weakness in the federal data, economists said.Consumer prices this year have risen at about the fastest pace in four decades, pressuring household finances. The Federal Reserve has also been raising borrowing costs aggressively to reduce inflation. Higher interest rates have already pushed mortgage demand to the lowest level since 1997.  ""Export growth will soon fade and domestic demand is getting crushed under the weight of higher interest rates,"" Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. ""We expect the economy to enter a mild recession in the first half of next year."" What this boils down to: Don't be lulled into a false sense of security, financial advisors cautioned.While a downturn isn't inevitable, households can take financial steps to prepare in case one comes and triggers layoffs and more market volatility along the way.""Think of a reasonable worst-case scenario — how would you fund it?"" said Allan Roth, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant based in Colorado Springs, Colorado.1. Shore up your cash reservesHouseholds should always ensure they have access to cash in case things go wrong, whether job loss, home repairs or unexpected medical bills, for example. But with recession might come greater likelihood of needing to draw from that financial buffer.The general rule of thumb is to have three to six months' worth of expenses handy. Sun advises clients to have six months, plus an extra three months for each child in a household.Consumers should consider adjusting their emergency-fund needs based on overall stability, Roth said. For example, someone working at a start-up company generally has a less dependable job income stream than a tenured university professor and may therefore need more cash access, he said.""Cash"" also has a broader definition than parking money in a traditional bank account with paltry returns, advisors said. Consumers can look to high-yield online savings accounts or money market funds, for example, advisors said, which currently pay a higher return.2. Reduce your debt burdenPaying down credit-card debt and other high-interest loans — and making sure households aren't racking up more — is also of primary importance, experts said.Something that lends further urgency to this advice: Variable rates are likely to increase more due to the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest-rate hikes.""There's a potential for some folks to lose their jobs, and you'd hate to see in two or three months people don't have any savings, have gone into debt, and it triggers a wave of personal bankruptcies or other forms of financial hardship,"" Leer said.Clients are showing more financial anxiety these days than they have in many years — but paradoxically, many households spend more to feel better, and that may be happening on credit cards, said Sun. Credit-card balances jumped 13% in Q2 — the largest year-over-year increase in more than 20 years, according to a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Sun advises focusing on paying down debt with interest near or above the inflation rate, which is currently about 8% on an annual basis.

2022-10-28,"""You're seeing a mitigation of the rate of growth, not a slowdown. Not negative growth,"" Brian Moynihan told CNBC.Consumers still have strong credit, unemployment is low, wage growth is strong and corporations are still in good shape, he said, though there are recessionary risks.The Fed will take the funds rate to around 5% and then ""let it work,"" Moynihan said. U.S. consumer spending is experiencing a ""mitigation of growth"" but not a slowdown, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Friday.Interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are starting to be felt in the housing and auto markets, and renters will see their budgets squeezed as landlords pass on higher costs, he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" But he stressed that consumer spending remains strong.""If you raise rates and slow down the economy to fight inflation, the expectation is you have a slowdown in consumer spending. It hasn't happened yet. So it could happen, but it hasn't happened yet,"" Moynihan said.""You're seeing a mitigation of the rate of growth, not a slowdown. Not negative growth.""Bank of America expects the Fed to hike rates by 75 basis points and 50 basis points at its two remaining meetings this year, followed by two 25 basis point increases next year. One basis point equals 0.01%.That will take the funds rate to around 5% and the Fed can then ""let it work,"" Moynihan said.The current rate of 3%-3.25% is the highest it's been since early 2008 and follows three 75 basis point rises in a bid to combat inflation, which was running at 8.2% on an annual basis in September.Economists, politicians and business leaders are split on whether the U.S. economy is heading for a recession or is already in one. U.S. gross domestic product grew for the first time this year in the third quarter, expanding at a higher-than-expected 2.6% annually.JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon told CNBC he expects a recession in six to nine months given quantitative tightening and the unknown impact of Russia's war in Ukraine. But for now, consumers still have strong credit, unemployment is low, wage growth is strong and corporations are in good shape with strong underlying credit — even if growth and earnings are slowing, Moynihan said. However he did concede there were risks from unforeseen events with ""low probability and high impact.""""You don't see those risks evidencing in behavior change of companies and consumers yet. People aren't laying off massive amounts of people, they're not hiring as many,"" he said.Asked whether the corporate credit market was flashing any warning signs, Moynihan said, ""I would not confuse credit risk with pricing risk.""""Growth and earnings may be slowing down, again because the economy recovered very fast and had major growth that flattens out a little bit. If you see negative GDP prints, of course corporate earnings might slow down,"" he added.""But on the other hand they're still making money, the margins are still holding ... the underlying credit, the underlying structure of the credit, the underlying credit quality is very strong."" Moynihan said Europe could see a recession early to mid next year before ""coming back out the other side,"" with the war in Ukraine and energy crisis risks on the horizon.""But right now you don't see the conditions because the employment's strong, the underlying activity's strong, the amount of stimulus that was put in is still in the markets that people don't see it as a deep recession.""He added: ""The energy question is much different than the U.S. The good news is the U.S. is a big economy, if we can get the energy to Europe, for the people to heat their homes and industry to run, that would be a good thing. And I know all the companies are working on it, because I talk to them about it.""

2022-10-31,"This election season, voters are laser-focused on one big issue: the economy. Americans rank inflation as the most important problem facing the U.S., followed by jobs and the overall economy, an October Ipsos/Reuters poll found.In the last year, Americans aimed to go back to dining out, traveling and enjoying in-person events, which became scarce in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. But skyrocketing prices for everything from eggs to airfare, as well as uncertainty about the future, put a damper on many of those plans.Voters may be divided on a lot of issues, but they all seem to agree that money and how the government affects it need to be addressed. When asked what single message voters hope to send politicians with their votes this year, the responses tied for No. 1 are ""be more effective and do more"" and ""fix the economy and reduce the cost of living,"" an NBC News poll found.With that in mind, here's a look at three of the top economic issues facing the U.S. right now. The consumer price index sitting comfortably at 40-year highs has consumers frustrated and pinching pennies to make ends meet. Elevated prices on essentials like gas and groceries make it difficult to find places to cut back.Workers have seen huge wage gains over the last year, with hourly earnings up 5% in September from the previous year. Still, that's not enough to keep up with inflation.The Federal Reserve's rate hikes aim to get inflation under control. In the meantime, voters want to see Congress and the White House step in.Change to personal incomes has historically been one of the most reliable election predictors, says Stephen Ansolabehere, a government professor at Harvard and expert in elections and politics.""Even though incomes are going up, inflation is reducing it in real terms. That's what's hurting the Democrats,"" Ansolabehere tells CNBC Make It. ""Whether inflation has to do with something that the administration did, that's not something voters actually care about. It's more about, 'Am I better off?'"" While bright spots like low unemployment and a rebounding gross domestic product (GDP) show some potential for fighting off an impending recession, voters and experts aren't feeling optimistic about avoiding one altogether.Bloomberg economists recently pegged the probability of the U.S. entering a recession within 12 months at 100%. And less than a third of voters expect the economy to improve in the next year, according to a CNBC poll.Layoffs haven't spread through the job market yet. All the same, 91% of CEOs expect a recession in the coming year, according to a KPMG survey of 1,325 CEOs between July 12 and August 24, 2022. And 52% of CEOs said conditions in their own industries were worse at the start of the fourth quarter, a survey from non-partisan think tank The Conference Board found.Despite reports that administration officials were beginning to explore recession response plans earlier this month, Biden celebrated the third quarter GDP reports and insisted Republicans would try to undercut that progress.The Fed continues to raise interest rates in its effort to curb inflation, but those rate hikes could tip the U.S. into a recession if higher borrowing costs cool demand too much.Even if the Fed is technically to blame for sending the country into a recession, voters will likely look to their elected leaders for solutions.  The stock market is not a full picture of the economy, but its performance certainly matters to voters. Watching their portfolios swell as pandemic recovery efforts took hold, only to bust and remain volatile through 2022, has many consumers re-thinking retirement plans and worried about their futures.The stock market will remain up-and-down until there is a clear idea of what the government is doing, Harvard's Ansolabehere says. Tax reform and changes to funding for social programs like food stamps and Medicare can affect consumer budgets and lead to more market uncertainty.""There are things Congress shouldn't do, and things that they can do in terms of creating a more stable situation,"" Ansolabehere says. ""What Wall Street wants is certainty. They want to be able to expect what Congress is going to do in terms of budgets and taxes.""Finding that stability could be challenging. If Democrats lose the House, Congress could gear up for another debt ceiling standoff that may threaten to shut down the government or push the country to default on its debt, The Washington Post reports.The war in Ukraine, another Covid surge and climate change could slow down or undo progress toward a full economic recovery, where prices come back down to earth and checking your 401(k) isn't so gut-wrenching.

2022-10-31,"Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., is chair of the centrist New Democrat Coalition in the U.S. House of Representatives. As voters head to the polls next Tuesday, they'll look at what Congress has accomplished, and the economy will be top of mind. Republicans often claim their party is better for the economy, but if we look at what Democratic majorities have done in just two short years – including recently passing the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act – it's clear the Democratic party is the one setting our country and economy up for long-term success.In fact, history has shown that Democratic policies grow our economy at a higher annual average rate, create tens of millions of good jobs, and strengthen our economy overall. Just last week, the GDP quarterly report showed that the U.S. GDP grew 2.6% in the third quarter of 2022 under Democratic leadership. All of this is a direct result of the work Democrats have done in Congress and in the White House.I've seen this work firsthand. As a former business executive, entrepreneur, and in my current role as the chair of the nearly 100-member center-left New Democrat Coalition, I know how hard Democrats are working to grow our economy so every American can succeed in it. In February, New Dems established an inflation working group and met with industry and economic experts like Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, former Treasury Secretary and economist Larry Summers, Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo, and Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, to find policies to lower costs for Americans. As a result, we developed a comprehensive action plan to fight inflation that outlined an affordability agenda and actions Congress and the Biden administration can take to cut costs for families. We've had one of the most productive Congresses in recent memory and made great progress on the New Dem Action Plan by passing legislation to lower health care and energy costs, secure supply chains, create jobs, fight climate change, and improve our nation's infrastructure. Republicans had every opportunity to join Democrats in our efforts to strengthen our economy and cut costs for working families, but they nearly unanimously voted against each of these policies.On top of these legislative accomplishments, Democrats decreased federal spending by $550 billion and reduced the deficit by $1.4 trillion in 2022 – the biggest single year drop in the deficit in American history. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the deficit is projected to fall by even more. Republicans ­promised this for years but failed to accomplish it. In fact, under former President Donald Trump's leadership, Republicans passed a tax law that the CBO predicted would increase the deficit by $1.9 trillion and the deficit exploded under the last three Republican presidents. Republican attacks on Democrats fall flat when you look at their economic record, which also includes two recessions under recent GOP presidents.While Democrats are moving America forward, Republicans are working to move our country and economy backward. This is especially clear following the unveiling of the House GOP's ""Commitment to America"" agenda, which would strip women of their essential freedoms, gut Social Security and Medicare, and threaten the sanctity of our elections. This isn't an economic plan. The truth is, Republicans have no plan. While they're playing the blame game and waging culture wars, we're keeping our heads in the game, improving our economy and safeguarding Americans' hard-earned freedoms.Conventional wisdom says Republicans have the upper hand on the economy, but New Dems are quickly dispelling that myth.Under President Biden's leadership, Democrats have grown our economy 3 times faster than when Republicans controlled Congress and the White House. We've also created 9.5 million jobs – five times as many jobs than created under the last three Republican Presidents combined – brought unemployment down to a historically low 3.5%, increased wages above historic norms, delivered on long-time goals like protecting our planet and tackled rising costs. Democrats accomplished all of this even with the slimmest of majorities in Congress. But our work is never done. When Democrats win the majority on Nov. 8, we will continue our work to spur economic growth and improve opportunities for Americans. New Dems are focused on passing legislation on paid family leave and child care to enable more parents to return to the workplace, immigration reform to secure our border and address the labor shortage, an expanded Child Tax Credit to set the next generation up for success, and so much more. This is what a pro-business, pro-worker, pro-economic growth party and economic plan look like. The Democratic party is the only American political party that has repeatedly brought economic growth and will continue to do so in the years to come. In stark contrast, the GOP agenda contains no real policy plans and will only create an unstable and uncertain economy for hard working families. That's not what Americans want or need. Republicans no longer deserve the title of the economically responsible party. Democrats do.While Republicans look to the past, New Dems look to the future – and in about a week, Americans will decide between the two."
2022-11-01,"For this winter, Europe's gas storage is more than 90% full, according to the International Energy Agency, providing some assurance against a major shortage. But a large proportion of that is made up of Russian gas imported in previous months, which likely won't be available at all by winter of 2023.This could lead to significant social unrest — already, small to medium-sized protests have cropped up around Europe. ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — Politicians and governments around the world are bracing for potential civil unrest as many countries grapple with mounting energy costs and rising inflation. The global economy is facing an onslaught from multiple sides — a war in Europe, and shortages of oil, gas and food, and high inflation, each of which has worsened the next.Concerns are centered on the coming winter, especially for Europe. Cold weather, combined with an oil and gas shortage stemming from Western sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, threatens to upend lives and businesses.But as much worry as there is ahead of this winter, it's really the winter of 2023 that people should be worried about, major oil and gas executives have warned.""We've got a difficult winter ahead, and subsequent to that we've got a more difficult winter in the year ahead of that, because the production that is available to Europe in the first half of 2023 is considerably less than the production we had available to us in the first half of 2022,"" Russell Hardy, CEO of major oil trader Vitol, told CNBC's Hadley Gamble during a panel at the Adipec conference in Abu Dhabi.""So the consequences of energy shortage and therefore price escalation, all of the things that have been discussed here about the cost of living, the expectation of problems ahead, clearly need to be thought about in that context,"" he said. BP CEO Bernard Looney, speaking at the same panel, agreed. Energy prices ""are approaching unaffordability,"" with some people already ""spending 50% of their disposable income on energy or higher,"" he said.But through a combination of high gas storage levels and government spending packages to subsidize people's bills, Europe may be able to manage the crisis this year.""I think it has been addressed for this winter,"" Looney said. ""It's the next winter I think many of us worry, in Europe, could be even more challenging.""  The CEO of Italian oil and gas giant Eni expressed the same worry.For this winter, Europe's gas storage is around 90% full, according to the International Energy Agency, providing some assurance against a major shortage.But a large proportion of that is made up of Russian gas imported in previous months, as well as gas from other sources that was easier than usual to buy since major importer China was buying less due to its slower economic activity. ""We are in good shape for this winter,"" Eni chief Claudio Descalzi said. ""But as we said, the issue is not this winter. It will be the next one, because we are not going to have Russian gas – 98% [less] next year, maybe nothing."" This could lead to serious social unrest — already, small to medium-sized protests have cropped up around Europe.Anti-government protests in Germany and Austria in September and in the Czech Republic last week — the latter of which has seen household energy bills surge tenfold — may be a small taste of what's to come, analysts have warned. Some energy executives agreed. ""We've seen that any shocks to the price at the pump, or something as simple as LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] for cooking, can cause unrest,"" the CEO of Malaysian oil and gas company Petronas, Datuk Tengku Muhammad Taufik, said. He described how a strengthening dollar and rising fuel prices pose a serious risk to many Asian economies – massive populations that are some of the biggest oil and gas importers in the world. And this is happening while subsidies are already in place to help ease prices for citizens. Many Asian economies were already reeling from the pandemic, which caused ""vast swaths of [small and medium enterprises] in Asia to just collapse,"" Taufik said. ""So, yes, there is a real risk that governments without a steady hand on policy shaping in Asia can deal with unrest.""  Much of the anger of protesters is also directed at the energy companies, which have been making record profits as bills get higher and higher.Responding to this, many of the CEOs who spoke to CNBC said it's an issue of market supply and demand, and that it's up to governments to implement policies more conducive to energy investment. That investment, they stressed, has taken a hit in recent years as countries push for the transition to renewables.     The world has to face ""the practicalities and realities of today and tomorrow,"" BP's Looney said, stressing the need to ""invest in hydrocarbons today, because today's energy system is a hydrocarbon system.""Many policymakers and institutions still decry the use of fossil fuels, warning the far bigger crisis is that of climate change. In June, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for abandoning fossil fuel finance, and called any new funding for exploration ""delusional."" The oil executives argued that this approach simply isn't realistic, nor is it an option if countries want economic and political stability.

2022-11-01,"Americans look to the country's most powerful bank, the Federal Reserve, to combat inflation.""I think our biggest problem, at least for the foreseeable future, is high inflation,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNBC.The Fed can raise interest rates to slow inflation, which ultimately makes the cost of borrowing higher for everyday Americans, and that can be just as painful as inflation.""The big question mark is how quickly will inflation come under control?"" Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told CNBC.The central bank already raised interest rates five times in 2022, and there are more rate hikes on the way.But the Federal Reserve does not have to take on the battle alone.Fiscal policy enacted by Congress and power wielded by big business can help fight rising costs.""Congress has much more targeted tools,"" Claudia Sahm, former Fed economist, told CNBC. ""It's about making the system work more effectively, so all these costs don't get piled up on individuals.""For example, the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act. This $739 billion sweeping tax, health and climate bill aims to reshape the U.S. economy.""Taxpayers eventually have to pay for them, but they can release a lot of pressure on families and businesses that are trying to pay the bills,"" Sahm said.Then there's the private sector's power. As people started expecting higher prices, some are arguing that companies are taking advantage of expectations and increasing prices even further than is necessary.According to the New York Fed, the more inflation an industry saw, the more gross profits increased.Now, most U.S. companies are recording their largest profits since 1950, at least over the last two quarters, according to OMFIF.Watch the video above to learn more about how corporations and Congress influence inflation, why the Fed doesn't have to take on rising costs alone and what it will take to normalize the U.S. economy."
2022-11-01,"As inflation continues to impact global economies, Asia-Pacific will be the only region to see real salary growth in 2023, a new survey has found. According to the annual Salary Trends Report by data company ECA International, the average real salary increase — which is nominal wage growth minus the rate of inflation — is predicted to increase by 1.3% in Asia-Pacific. That's compared to other regions which will see drops in average real salary, the report showed. A decrease of 1.5% is expected for Europe, 0.5% for North and South America, and 0.1% for Africa and the Middle East. Eight out of the top 10 countries with the highest real salary increases globally are from Asia-Pacific this year, ECA international added.  ""With inflation increasing significantly in 2022, 78% of countries surveyed recorded a real salary decrease, and no European country saw a real-terms salary increase,"" said Lee Quane, ECA International's regional director. ""Even though the global situation is expected to improve next year with higher nominal salary increases and lower inflation on average, a 0.5% decrease in real terms is still expected."" The annual report is based on information collected from over 360 multinational companies in 68 countries, said ECA international.  In Asia-Pacific, India will see the biggest increase of real wages at 4.6%, followed by Vietnam at 4%, and China at 3.8% growth. The report also pointed out that most locations surveyed in APAC are expected to see the ""same or higher"" rates of real salary growth in 2023, just as they did in 2022.  India is predicted to have the biggest increase of real salaries globally. That's because of the Indian economy's growth rate and ""the need for salary growth to outstrip inflation,"" Quane told CNBC Make It.""Although inflation rates have grown in India in 2022 in comparison to 2021, salaries will increase at a faster rate in nominal terms.""Workers in China are also amongst ""a small group globally"" who will receive the highest rates of real salary growth this year and the next, Quane said.In 2022, salaries in China increased nominally by 5.9% and will grow by 6% in 2023.  ""Although nominal salary increase rates in China are not amongst the highest in APAC, low rates of inflation mean that workers there received the highest rate of salary growth in real terms,"" said Quane. While Asia-Pacific will see fairer skies compared to other regions in 2023, not all countries in the region will celebrate. Countries like Laos and Myanmar will experience a ""significant decline"" in real salaries due to economic and political problems, said Quane. In Singapore, even though workers will see a salary increase of 3.8%, inflation will reduce disposable income and set wages back by 1.7% in real terms this year, the report said.ECA International estimates Singapore's real salary growth will be 1% in 2023.""Salaries will fall by almost 2% this year in real terms but workers in Singapore are not alone as those in eight other countries in the region will also experience a fall in the buying power of their salaries in 2022,"" said Quane.  As global inflation rates hit record-high this year, average worldwide salaries fell by 3.8% this year, when inflation was factored in, said ECA International. That's despite a 4% increase of average salary and an expected 5% increase in 2023. ""Even though the global situation is expected to improve next year with higher nominal salary increases and lower inflation on average, a 0.5% decrease in real terms is still expected,"" said Quane. ""Our survey indicates another tough year for workers globally in 2023,"" he added.""Only around a third (37%) of the countries surveyed are forecast to see real-terms salary increase, though this is better than the 22% that experienced increases this year.""

The level of interest rates will also be higher than previously expected, he said.""There were no hints of dovishness to indicate the Fed may be poised to pause,"" McIntyre pointed out.The central bank saying it would consider cumulative tightening of monetary policy suggests it is leaving the door open to slow down the pace of hikes, not end them.""Today was all about—and only about—giving the Fed flexibility or optionality to back off their path of 75 [basis point] hikes,"" McIntyre said.""CPI reports, labor reports, and the ongoing impact of China's zero-COVID policy on global growth are all more important than any signal of Fed action. From this point on, we should think slower and steady…until something breaks.""— Michelle Fox  Wed, Nov 2 20223:20 PM EDT Powell said that while he believes it is ""still possible"" for the Fed to achieve a soft landing, the path has ""narrowed.""""We've always said it was going to be difficult, but to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer it becomes harder to see the path. It's narrowed. I would say the path has narrowed over the course of the last year,"" Powell said.— Jesse Pound  Wed, Nov 2 20223:15 PM EDT Traders bet the Fed could raise the fed funds rates to a high of 5.05%, before stopping its current rate hiking cycle.The May contract reached that level after dipping to 4.93% after the Fed's policy statement opened the door to a potential reduction in the size of interest rate hikes. The Fed raised its target rate by three-quartes of a point Wednesday afternoon.But a hawkish Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who spoke a half hour after the Fed statement, sent Treasury yields and fed funds futures higher.""Powell thinks the bias is they should tighten more than they would otherwise think, just so they should take out some insurance,"" said Michael Schumacher of Wells Fargo. ""His quote was that it's very premature to think about pausing. They're not going to pause anytime soon."" Stocks sold off after initially gaining after the Fed statement.

""It is very premature to be thinking about pausing. People when they hear 'lags' think about a pause. It is very premature, in my view, to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hikes. We have a ways to go,"" he said. — Jesse Pound  Wed, Nov 2 20222:48 PM EDT Jerome Powell said that the Fed could ease off of its three-quarters-point hike pace in December or January.""As we come closer to that level and move further into restrictive territory, the question of speed becomes less important. ... And that's why I've said at the last two press conferences that at some point it will be important to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming, and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made,"" Powell said. As speed becomes less important, the terminal level of interest rates and the length that the Fed will need to keep rates there take precedent, Powell said. — Jesse Pound  Wed, Nov 2 20222:44 PM EDT Changes to the Federal Reserve's post-meeting statement along with another 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike Wednesday should be enough to indicate that the central bank is getting ready to slow down the pace of interest rate increases, according to Capital Economics.With the increase that takes the fed funds rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the Fed ""can afford to slow the pace of rate hikes"" as it assesses the hikes approved this year, wrote Paul Ashworth, Capital's chief North America economist.""Barring another upside inflation surprise in the October and November CPI reports, which we can't completely rule out, it looks like the Fed is laying the groundwork to shift down to a 50bp hike in December and, if we're right that core inflation will start to show signs of slowing soon, a 25bp rate hike at the January meeting next year,"" Ashworth added.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at his post-meeting news conference that slowing the pace of rate hikes could be discussed at the December or January meetings.— Jeff Cox  Wed, Nov 2 20222:44 PM EDT Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank still has ""some ways to go"" before the current rate hike cycle is over, noting that ""incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected.""The major U.S. stock indexes pulled back from their earlier session highs after Powell's comment during his news conference.""Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook of economic activity,"" Powell added.— Fred Imbert  Wed, Nov 2 20222:33 PM EDT The Federal Reserve's language ""sufficiently above neutral"" is key in its post-decision statement, Morgan Stanley Investment Management's Jim Caron told CNBC.The central bank said, ""The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.""""What the Fed just told us they are willing to get us to a level that is sufficiently above neutral and keep rates there and then wait for inflation to start to come down,"" said Caron, the firm's senior advisor on the fixed income team.""So what that really signals today to me is that this is the start of the end game.""He sees the terminal rate at 5%, which would be 250 basis points above neutral.""From a cost benefit perspective, it doesn't do as much damage to the asset markets and to the broader economy… by just hiking rates and hiking rates and hiking rates in order to achieve your inflation goal,"" he said.— Michelle Fox  Wed, Nov 2 20222:29 PM EDT The Federal Reserve will likely go for smaller interest rate hikes after its latess 0.75 percentage point rate increase, according to Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. The big change in the central bank's statement came when the Fed discussed factors that would influence policy going forward, saying that the committee will ""take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.""""That is quite an expansion and refinement in language from the 4th paragraph in September, that they repeated again today, when all they said was 'the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook,'"" said Boockvar. Going forward, he sees front loading as essentially over as the Fed watches the bigger picture that's unfolding as they fight inflation. ""Rate hikes from here will be more cognizant of the new economic environment we're in with respect to the much higher cost of capital and economic clouds that are circling,"" he said.

Ragan pointed to Powell previously saying that the Fed had hiked to the low end of a restrictive range as the example of the type of comment that investors are looking for.""If they go to 3.75-4%, how restrictive do they view that? I think that's going to be important,"" he said.Discussions about the state of the economy will also be closely monitored, Ragan added.— Jesse Pound  Wed, Nov 2 20221:43 PM EDT The Federal Reserve is expected to announce that it is raising its fed funds target rate range by three-quarters of a point.The Fed is also widely expected to signal that it could slow down the pace of rate hikes, and the market is pricing in a good chance of a smaller 50 basis point hike for December. A basis point equals 0.01 of a percentage point.If the Fed decides to signal smaller hikes are coming, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could be the messenger when he briefs the media at 2:30 p.m. ET.Powell could make such a comment in response to a question, according to Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. But Caron stresses that Powell will not provide a definitive comment.""He's going to hide behind the data,"" said Caron.

2022-11-02,"The job market remains stronger than expected despite ongoing recession fears and seemingly constant news of mass layoffs.Job openings rose to 10.7 million in September, according to the Department of Labor's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, after a dip in August that economists said could kick off a downturn in the labor market.Other report numbers show signs of stabilizing between hiring demand and available workers: New hires edged down to 6.1 million (from 6.3 million) and quits slid down to 4.1 million (from 4.2 million). Layoffs remain historically low at 1.3 million, or under 1% of the workforce. But there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker.However, some sectors are experiencing surprising drops in employment, and it's enough to cause job seekers and workers to worry, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak tells CNBC Make It. Pollak says that diving into jobs in each industry is like looking at a tale of two labor markets.One the one hand, the health-care industry is ""growing by leaps and bounds"" with more than 2 million job openings. Major enterprises with 5,000-plus employees are also winning out with an all-time high topping 311,000 openings.""Huge companies are winning the war for talent and consolidating the labor market, with mid-sized companies unable to compete,"" Pollak says. On the flip side, the ""most dramatic"" part of the September report is the drop in finance and insurance jobs. Companies that benefited from low mortgage rates, a homebuying and mortgage refinancing spree, and a retail stock trading frenzy throughout the pandemic experienced a ""huge hiring boom"" through mid-2022. Now that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and made it more expensive to borrow money, ""all those trends have gone sharply into reverse,"" Pollak says.Job openings in finance and insurance grew rapidly throughout the pandemic but have fallen by more than 40% in the last two months, Pollak adds. ""It's the one part of the report that looks like a recession."" Job market turbulence has been more pronounced for Wall Street and Silicon Valley jobs, Pollak says, which tend to get a lot of media coverage but aren't always a good proxy for what the rest of the labor market looks like.A majority of CEOs are preparing for a downturn by reducing headcounts, particularly around marketing and advertising teams. But as long as consumers are out there spending on goods and services, those workforce reduction plans in aggregate will keep getting pushed back.""We see CEOs preparing for a downturn that hasn't arrived yet and may never arrive,"" Pollak says. Hotel occupancy rates are stable, airlines continue to see high numbers of travelers, and restaurant spending is healthy, she says. ""Businesses on Main Street continue to do well and are fighting for talent.""These sectors will continue to do well and pump up hiring as long as Americans are willing to go out and spend, and ""the average U.S. consumer is still doing pretty well,"" Pollak says.Many Americans, whose savings ballooned throughout the pandemic between spending less and getting Covid stimulus, still have more money in the bank today than they did pre-pandemic, but personal savings rates are dropping as high inflation eats into purchasing power and leads more people to rack up credit card debt.At some point, this growth in spending will have to slow, Pollak says. That could happen if people start to lose their jobs. Workers in some sectors may be more cautious with recession fears looming: Quits fell in construction; transportation, warehousing, and utilities; and durable goods manufacturing as workers see fewer alternatives for better work and hang onto their jobs.Job seekers in the last month are becoming less bold, according to a ZipRecruiter index. People are less likely to negotiate their offers and less likely to quit without another job lined up. They're putting more priority on job and company stability, like big corporations in recession resistant sectors.With all that said, Pollak says we're not in a recession, by definition of the National Bureau of Economic Research that takes a look at sustained drops in personal income, employment, consumer spending, and industrial production.Jobs are plentiful, hiring is strong and layoffs are low. ""It's hard to call something a recession when people are making money and getting great jobs,"" she says.Check out:'The more transparency, the better': How NYC job seekers say visible pay ranges will help themCold and flu season is here, and people are showing up to work sick againHow Gen Z is rewriting dating, marriage and family plans for their 20sSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"
2022-11-02,"Struggling to dampen inflation, the Federal Reserve announced a widely expected fourth consecutive ""jumbo"" 0.75 percentage point rate hike on Wednesday. While raising interest rates can slow inflation by making borrowing more expensive, and therefore less appealing, the move further increases debt costs for Americans already struggling with rising prices on pretty much everything, including necessities like food and rent. The year-over-year inflation rate has remained stubbornly high, only slowing from a June peak of 9.1% to 8.2% as of September, according to Consumer Price Index data. That's well above the central bank's preferred inflation rate of 2%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has reaffirmed his commitment to lowering inflation with continued rate hikes in recent months. However, in August, he acknowledged that increasing the cost of borrowing will bring ""some pain to households and businesses.""By raising its benchmark federal funds rate — the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another — the Fed increases the cost of borrowing for consumers, which, in turn, can cool down inflation. But increased interest rates discourage economic growth, which can trigger a recession in which many people already dealing with rising costs lose their jobs.Ultimately, inflation affects people's spending power more directly than interest rate hikes do. Although more increases may cause ""some pain,"" the Fed's policy is meant to lower prices.With today's rate increase, the benchmark federal funds rate is a range of 3.75% to 4%. Rates are expected to peak at 4.5% to 4.75% in 2023, according to the U.S. central bank's own projections. Last week, Goldman Sachs economists said they expected the Fed to lift its benchmark rate even higher, to a range of 4.75% to 5% by March 2023. That means the costs of borrowing will continue to get more expensive, as more rate hikes are likely to follow. As successive rate increases discourage borrowing, many economists think that a recession — a sustained decline in economic activity over several months — is more likely in 2023. There's a 2 in 3 chance that the economy will contract in the next 12 to 18 months, according to 14 economists surveyed by financial services site Bankrate. That's up from a 1 in 3 chance, according to a survey conducted at the beginning of the year.Similarly, a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists predicts the probability of a recession over the next year is now 60%, up from 50% a month earlier. More pessimistically, a Bloomberg probability model projects a 100% chance of a recession by Oct. 2023. With increased interest rates, consumers can expect increased costs for several types of debt. Here's a look at four common ones:Credit cards: The annual percentage rate (APR) on credit cards is likely to climb to an average of 19% from 18.16% as of late September, according to Greg McBride, Bankrate's chief financial analyst. For a credit card balance of $5,000 with a 19% APR, you'd pay an additional $1,197 in interest costs compared to a 16% APR, which was the average interest rate at the beginning of 2022.Auto financing: Expect increased interest costs for new auto loans, or auto loans with variable-rate financing. The average interest rate on a 60-month new car loan will likely increase slightly to 6% from its current rate of 5.63%, says McBride. Compared to Jan. 2022, that works out to about an extra $34 per month in auto financing payments for a $35,000 new car, he says.Mortgages: Interest rates for mortgages tend to rise with rate hikes, but they are more directly influenced by the bond market. The rate for 30-year fixed mortgages could climb from just over 7% to 7.25% if inflation remains high or increases, says McBride.Other variable-rate loans: Interest rates on variable-rate loans, like home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC), are likely to increase with the rate hike, says McBride. Currently, the average interest rates on these loans is closer to 7.3%, but they could climb to an average of 8%.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Holiday sales at Target and Amazon are starting in October—here's why shopping early is a smart financial move"
2022-11-03,"The Bank of England said Thursday that the U.K. is facing its longest recession since records began.The central bank described the outlook for Britain's economy as ""very challenging,"" noting that unemployment would likely double during the country's two-year slump.The BOE raised interest rates by an historic 75 basis points Thursday, its largest hike in 33 years.  LONDON — The Bank of England warned Thursday that the U.K. is facing its longest recession since records began, with the economic downturn expected to extend well into 2024.The central bank described the outlook for Britain's economy as ""very challenging,"" noting that unemployment would likely double to 6.5% during the country's two-year slump.U.K. GDP is projected to decline by around 0.75% over the second half of 2022, reflecting the squeeze on real incomes from surging energy and tradable goods prices, the Bank said.Growth is projected to continue to fall throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024, as ""high energy prices and tighter financial conditions weigh on spending,"" it added. The forecast, outlined at the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee meeting Thursday, would constitute the country's longest — though not deepest — recession since the 1920s when reliable records began.At its meeting in August, the Bank had predicted the U.K. was facing its longest recession since the global financial crisis, lasting five quarters to the end of 2023. The projections come as the BOE raised its benchmark interest rate by a historic 75 basis points Thursday — its largest increase since 1989. The MPC voted 7-2 in favor of the decision, taking baseline borrowing costs from 2.25% to 3%.The eighth consecutive rate hike marks the central bank's continued efforts to tame rampant U.K. inflation, which hit a 40-year high of 10.1% in September, and edge costs down toward its 2% target.Governor Andrew Bailey told CNBC that the U.K.'s tight labor market continues to pose a major inflationary pressure, even as the Bank sees price rises dipping below 10% in the second quarter of 2023. ""We have inflation coming back down to target; and going below target actually. But we have one of the largest upside risks to inflation in our forecast that we've had in the 25-year history of the MPC,"" Bailey told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche.""A lot of that has to do with the tightness of the U.K. labor market,"" he continued. ""The U.K. labor force has shrunk since immediately before Covid, so there are risks.""Even still, the Bank struck a dovish note against the backdrop of weakening economic growth and shifting fiscal policy, noting that future rate increases would likely to be less aggressive than expected.""Should the economy evolve broadly in line with the latest Monetary Policy Report projections, further increases in Bank Rate may be required for a sustainable return of inflation to target, albeit to a peak lower than priced into financial markets,"" the MPC said.The British pound plunged on the announcement to trade around $1.118, while U.K. government bond yields rose. As of 2.30 p.m. local time it was trading at $1.1196. The BOE's forecasts are especially hard to piece together given the government's as yet unclear fiscal strategy, more details on which are set to be announced on Nov. 17.The Bank was forced to intervene in financial markets in September, launching an emergency bond-buying operation after then-prime minister Liz Truss' controversial mini-budget sparked economic chaos. With recently installed Prime Minister Rishi Sunak now in office, and Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt having walked back most of his predecessor's proposed tax cuts, fiscal and monetary policy no longer seem to be pulling in opposite directions.As such, Bailey said he believes that related market risks have now laregly subsided. However, he added that the incident highlighted the need for greater regulatory oversight of the shadow banking industry.""I think we have dealt with that now, that particular issue. But I think it does point to a whole part of the landscape — the non-bank finance world — which we've got to have, globally, much more effective scrutiny of,"" Bailey said.""We've had a number of what we might call 'incidents' in that world, and it certainly dominates discussion of global financial stability. In terms of surveillance of the landscape, I would say the alert level is pretty high at the moment because we have had a few, quite striking incidents.""—CNBC's Elliot Smith contributed to this report."

See below for the latest updates.  Russia issued a straightforward statement about nuclear war that could indicate the Kremlin is trying to cool the escalatory rhetoric it used throughout October, NBC News reported on Thursday.""Russia is strictly and consistently guided by the tenet that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,"" said the statement on the Russian Foreign Ministry website.Meanwhile, as the war between Russia and Ukraine drags into the fall and winter, the economic repercussions on both countries, and the rest of the world, becomes clearer.Data released on Wednesday by Russia's Ministry of Economic Development showed the country's downturn continued in September, with a deepening contraction evident.Russia has insisted its economy can weather the storm of international sanctions, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisting earlier this week that ""no one could stop"" Russia's economy.Russia recently made a surprise return to the Black Sea grain initiative — a deal brokered with Ukraine by Turkey and the U.N. to enable the export of vital agricultural products like corn and wheat, of which Russia and Ukraine are major producers.President Vladimir Putin said that despite Russia's return to the deal, which it had withdrawn from last weekend after an apparent attack by Ukraine on Russia's Black Sea fleet, Moscow ""reserves the right to withdraw"" from it again if Ukrainian guarantees are not met.Grain shipments to African countries suffering from acute food shortages, such as Somalia and Sudan, will be prioritized now that the deal has been revived, Turkey's president said.  Fri, Nov 4 20222:01 AM EDT U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he is confident Ukrainian forces are capable of retaking Kherson from Russia.""On the issue of whether or not the Ukrainians can take the remaining territory on the west side of the Dnieper River in Kherson, I certainly believe that they have the capability to do that,"" Austin told reporters at the Pentagon.""Most importantly, the Ukrainians believe they have the capability to do that.

Thu, Nov 3 20224:47 PM EDT The basic food security of tens of millions across the globe hung by a thread this week as the United Nations, Turkey and Ukraine desperately worked to preserve a deal that has permitted Ukrainian grain to move through the Black Sea.Before Moscow's full-scale invasion of its ex-Soviet neighbor, Ukraine and Russia accounted for almost a quarter of global grain exports, until those shipments came to a severe halt for nearly six months.The Black Sea Grain Initiative eased Russia's naval blockade and saw the reopening of three key Ukrainian ports. Last week, Moscow suspended its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative citing retaliation for what it called Kyiv's ""act of terrorism"" against Russian warships. Russia rejoined the humanitarian agreement on Wednesday — but with the caveat that the Kremlin may decline to renew the deal, which is set to expire in two weeks.Here's a look at what Ukraine is exporting and to where: — Amanda Macias  Thu, Nov 3 20223:53 PM EDT Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his war-weary country will not participate in the G-20 summit if Russian President Vladimir Putin attends.""My personal position and the position of Ukraine was that if the leader of the Russian Federation participates then Ukraine will not participate.

We'll see, there are a few days left,"" Zelenskyy added.— Amanda Macias  Thu, Nov 3 20223:16 PM EDT Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo will travel to Paris, London and Brussels next week to ""continue close coordination with allies on sanctions against Russia for its brutal war against Ukraine.""In meetings with government counterparts, he will discuss sanctions and export controls on Russia in order to ""redouble efforts to deny Putin the revenue and military equipment he needs to further his illegal war,"" according to a Treasury readout.""Adeyemo will also discuss maintaining strong support for the Ukrainian government and people through direct economic assistance, as well as close coordination on implementing a price cap on Russian oil that will facilitate the flow of Russian oil onto global markets at lower prices and cut into Putin's main source of revenue,"" Treasury added.He will also discuss concerns regarding higher energy prices and exacerbated food insecurity, triggered in part by Russia's war in Ukraine.— Amanda Macias  Thu, Nov 3 20222:25 PM EDT U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow met with detained WNBA star Brittney Griner, the White House said. The Biden administration was ""told she is doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances,"" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. She reiterated that the U.S. made a ""significant offer"" to Russia for the release of both Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan. The Biden administration has since proposed alternatives to secure the U.S. citizens' return, Jean-Pierre added. A Russian court last month denied Griner's appeal of a nine-year prison sentence she received after authorities found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage at a Russian airport. The Biden administration has called Griner wrongfully detained and said her prison sentence is unacceptable.— Jacob Pramuk  Thu, Nov 3 20221:26 PM EDT A majority of Bulgaria's lawmakers approved sending the country's first military aid to Ukraine.The National Assembly voted 175-49 with one abstention in favor of a proposal submitted by four pro-European Union parties. The government has now one month to decide what kind of weapons Bulgaria can provide without affecting its own defense capabilities.Bulgaria previously agreed to repair Ukrainian military equipment at its factories but refused to send weapons directly due to opposition from President Rumen Radev and the country's Moscow-friendly political parties.Along with Hungary, Bulgaria was the only EU member country that had declined to give Ukraine weapons as it fights Russia's invasion and war.""More weapons mean more war,"" Bulgarian Socialist Party leader Kornelia Ninova said, explaining why her party's lawmakers voted against the proposal.The heated debate that preceded the vote reflected the divisions in Bulgaria since Russia invaded its neighbor. Even though the country belongs to both NATO and the EU, many Bulgarians harbor strong sympathies for Russia that are rooted in a history, culture, and religion. Bulgaria also relies heavily on Russian energy supplies.— Associated Press  Thu, Nov 3 202212:41 PM EDT The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded its inspection of three nuclear sites in Ukraine and said it found no evidence of undeclared nuclear activities or materials.""Over the past few days, the inspectors were able to carry out all activities that the IAEA had planned to conduct and were given unfettered access to the locations,"" the IAEA said in a statement.

Damage to the main river crossings means Russian units are at risk of being pinned against the river by the advancing Ukrainian army. Stremousov urged civilians remaining in the city to leave immediately, saying they were putting their lives in danger.

Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday that Moscow's renewed participation in the deal did not necessarily mean it would be renewed.""Of course, we still have to discuss the issue of extension officially, the deadline has not expired yet, it is still working ... but by the 19th, before making a decision to continue, it will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the implementation of the deal.

There was no immediate statement from either Russia or Britain on the details of what was discussed. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday the ambassador was to be summoned over Saturday's drone attack on Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Britain says the claims are false. After the drone attack, Russia temporarily suspended participation in a U.N.-brokered Black Sea Grain deal.Russia casts Britain as a particularly perfidious Western power which President Vladimir Putin says is plotting to destroy Russia and carve up its vast natural resources.After Russia invaded Ukraine, Britain, along with the United States and the European Union, imposed some of the most severe sanctions in history and supplied weapons to help Ukraine.

Between them, they have forecast that Russia's GDP could drop by at least 5.5% in the best-case scenario to almost 9% in the worst-case scenario.For its part, Russia's ministry forecast that Russia's economic output would decline by 2.9% in 2022 and by 0.8% in 2023, before growing by 2.6% in 2024 and 2025, Interfax reported.— Holly Ellyatt  Thu, Nov 3 20223:15 AM EDT CNBC's Shep Smith looks at reports that Russian military leaders recently discussed the possibility of using a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine.

Ukraine did not claim responsibility for the attack, which some Ukrainian officials blamed on Russian soldiers mishandling their own weapons.""We demanded assurances and guarantees from the Ukrainian side that nothing like this will happen in the future,"" Putin said in a meeting with permanent members of the Russian Security Council.""I have given instructions to the Ministry of Defense to resume our full participation in this work,"" he added. ""At the same time, Russia reserves the right to withdraw from these agreements if these guarantees are violated by Ukraine.""Early in the war, Russia relied on its Black Sea fleet to launch missiles deep into Ukraine, but the fleet drew back into a defensive position after a series of embarrassing attacks this spring by Ukrainian forces. Before last weekend's drone attack, analysts noted that Russia already appeared to be laying rhetorical groundwork for withdrawing from the deal, before reversing course this week.The grain is critical to feeding populations in some of the world's poorest countries, and a return to a full blockade could have brought famine to millions in Asia and the Middle East.

Inflation in Turkey rose for the 17th consecutive month in October, hitting 85.5% year-on-year as food and energy prices continued to climb, according to official figures.Food prices were 99% higher than the same period last year, housing rose by 85% and transport was up 117%, the Turkish Statistical Institute reported Thursday.The domestic producer price index shows a 157.69% increase annually and was up 7.83% on a monthly basis. The monthly rise in consumer prices was 3.54%.The dramatic rise in living costs for the country of 85 million has continued unabated for nearly two years, in tandem with significant devaluation of Turkey's currency, the lira.Controversially, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan refuses to raise interest rates, insisting that it would harm the economy. Economists and critics say his policies have continued to hurt the lira and push inflation up, fomenting a currency crisis.Turkey's central bank on Oct. 20 slashed its key interest rate by 150 basis points for the third consecutive month of cuts, from 12% to 10.5% — despite Turkish inflation at more than 83% at the time. Erdogan says the cuts are pro-growth, and that they will continue. The president remains determined to get the country's interest rate down to single digits by the end of this year.""My biggest battle is against interest. My biggest enemy is interest. We lowered the interest rate to 12%,"" the president said during an event in late September. ""Is that enough? It is not enough. This needs to come down further.""  Turkey's central bank ""will remain under pressure from President Erdogan for looser policy,"" Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at London-based Capital Economics, wrote in an analyst note after the data was released.He added that ""although the CBRT [Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey] said it will deliver one more 150bp interest rate cut at its meeting later this month, there is a risk of further easing beyond that, adding more downward pressure onto the lira.""The lira was trading roughly flat on the day at 18.61 to the dollar.

2022-11-04,"Regional Fed presidents Thomas Barkin and Susan Collins both indicated Friday they think more interest rate increases are needed, but maybe at not such an aggressive pace.""I think the implication for that is probably a slower pace of increases, a longer pace of increases and a potentially higher point,"" Barkin told CNBC.Collins said the Fed needs to examine the risks of overtightening against stopping too early in the fight against inflation. Two Federal Reserve officials indicated Friday that they expect further interest rate increases but will be looking closely at whether those moves need to be as aggressive as they've been this year.Regional president Thomas Barkin of Richmond and Susan Collins separately said that the Fed is moving into a new phase that will be examining how much more restrictive policy needs to be.In remarks to CNBC, Barkin said the rate hikes have taken policy to where the Fed now has switched from having its foot on the gas pedal to the brake. The new phase means policymakers will ""pump the brakes sometimes"" and ""act a little bit more defensively,"" he said.""I'm ready to do that, and I think the implication for that is probably a slower pace of increases, a longer pace of increases and a potentially higher point,"" he said during a live ""Squawk on the Street"" interview.Barkin added that he could see the fed funds rate — used as a benchmark for short-term borrowing —moving above 5% from its current target range of 3.75%-4%.Market pricing Friday moved higher to a potential ""terminal rate"" of 5.14%, which would be the highest level since mid-2007. The Fed on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase and indicated more hikes are coming.""We need to get inflation down to target and we need to do whatever we need do with rates to get inflation back to target,"" Barkin said. ""It is entirely conceivable to me, we would end up over 5%. But to me, that's not a plan, that would be an output of our effort to try to keep inflation under control.""Similarly, Collins stressed the need to attack inflation, while also weighing the impact the Fed's policies are having against easing up on rate hikes too quickly.""Policy has moved expeditiously into restrictive territory, but there is more work to do. In this next phase for policymaking, my focus is shifting from raising rates rapidly to determining the level that the funds rate must reach to be sufficiently restrictive to achieve the desired outcomes,"" she said in prepared remarks. ""This recognizes that the risks of inflation falling too slowly and of the economy weakening too quickly are becoming more balanced.""Collins is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Markets Committee, but Barkin is not.Both officials spoke the same day the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls in October rose by 261,000, well ahead of the 205,000 estimate, and that average hourly earnings increased 4.7% from a year ago, lower than the inflation rate and well ahead of the Fed's 2% inflation goal.Collins noted that the report was consistent with the idea that companies continue to need workers even with the slowing of demand. She added, though, that ""as policy tightens further, the risks of overtightening increase."" She said she doesn't think a ""significant slowdown"" in the economy is necessary to bring down inflation.""Therefore, it will increasingly be important to balance the risk of possibly slowing demand in the economy too much, with the risk of allowing inflation to persist too long and possibly de-anchoring inflation expectations,"" she said."
2022-11-04,"Australia's central bank on Friday downgraded the outlook for economic growth, warning that more rate hikes will be necessary to bring down sky-high inflation even as it strives to avoid an outright recession.In its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised its forecasts for inflation as it predicts higher wage growth ahead, and foreshadowed a faster pick-up in unemployment next year. Australia's central bank on Friday downgraded the outlook for economic growth, warning that more rate hikes will be necessary to bring down sky-high inflation even as it strives to avoid an outright recession.In its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised its forecasts for inflation as it predicts higher wage growth ahead, and foreshadowed a faster pick-up in unemployment next year.Yet even with further increases in rates, inflation was not expected to return to the bank's 2-3% target range beyond the end of 2024, pointing to a long period of pain ahead.""There are many uncertainties surrounding these forecasts that make the path to achieving the Board's objective of returning inflation to target while keeping the domestic economy on an even keel a narrow one,"" said the RBA.It added sharply higher electricity and gas prices — which are projected to rise by 20-30% next year — are likely to slow the return of inflation to the target range, while another round of floods has damaged the domestic food supply. Consumer inflation is now expected to peak around 8% later this year, up from 7.75% in its forecast in August. Core inflation — the trimmed mean — would likely accelerate to 6.5% by the end of the year, up from 6.0% previously.Both measures are expected to only slow to 3.2% by the end of 2024.However, the silver lining, according to the bank, is medium-term inflation expectations and wages growth have remained consistent with the inflation target, and it is important that this remains the case.Annual wage growth is expected to pick up to 3.1% this year and accelerate further to 3.9% for 2023 and 2024, which would be the fastest in many years.The central bank lifted its cash rate by 25 basis points on Tuesday to a nine-year peak of 2.85%, bringing its tightening to a steep 275 basis points since May.It downshifted to a 25 basis point increase in October after four outsized hikes of half a point, becoming the first of the major world central banks to slow its pace. Citing reasons for the downshift, the RBA said it was mindful that policy operates with a lage and the full effect of higher rates is yet to be felt in mortgage payments and household budgets.It also acknowledged that higher inflation is eroding real household incomes against the backdrop of a possible global recession.That leaves the RBA walking a narrow path between curbing inflation while not tipping the economy into recession.However, the bank reaffirmed its determination to bring inflation back to target, warning that rates will need to rise further.""If in future the Board judges that it needs to increase the cash rate in larger steps to secure the return of inflation to target, it will do so,"" said the RBA.""Similarly, if the situation requires the Board to hold the cash rate steady for a period, it will do so.""

LONDON — The Bank of England remains committed to its ""key goal"" of bringing down inflation, but hopes markets will ""re-anchor"" their interest rate expectations, Chief Economist Huw Pill told CNBC on Friday.The central bank on Thursday raised interest rates by 75 basis points, its largest single hike since 1989, and warned of a prolonged recession while also looking to temper market expectations for further aggressive monetary policy tightening.The Bank of England has a 2% inflation target, but price rises hit a 40-year high of 10.1% in September and are expected to peak in the fourth quarter.""We need both to be raising [the] bank rate but also to be taking actions to shrink the QE [quantitative easing] portfolio, to tighten policy in order to achieve our objective,"" Pill said.""And the fact that there have been these disturbances in markets, which have had their own needs to be addressed, that hasn't deterred us or deflected us from this medium-term key goal of what the Monetary Policy Committee is trying to do."" Pill suggested that recent volatility in the U.K. economy, such as the bond and currency market panic that greeted former Prime Minister Liz Truss' fiscal policy announcements in late September, had distorted market expectations for the Bank's future interest rate hiking trajectory.""We don't think interest rates would need to rise as high as the market has been pricing, precisely because that would induce a slowdown in the economy that is bigger than is required to get these inflationary dynamics under control,"" Pill added.The Bank expects an economic recession that began in the second half of 2022 to now last until mid-2024, which would be the longest period of GDP contraction since records began.""What we are seeking to do, we're always seeking to do this, is to find that balance that gets us back to our 2% inflation target without generating unnecessary and costly problems in the real side of the economy,"" Pill said.""And so it's creating that balance, signaling that balance, that was really our key message yesterday.""The Bank issued uncharacteristically direct guidance to markets on Thursday, and Pill said the period of political and economic disturbance in recent months meant the Monetary Policy Committee was trying to ""re-anchor [its] own thinking in the more fundamental drivers"" of inflation.""I think we're trying to re-anchor our communication around a forecast that emphasizes those more fundamental drivers,"" he said.""And I think we're hoping, we're intending that gives an opportunity for markets to re-anchor their thinking, and ultimately their pricing, in that sort of world looking through and beyond the disturbances that we've seen over the last few months.""The Bank was forced to intervene in the U.K. government bond market with an emergency two-week gilt purchase program in September, after the market's reaction to Truss' tax-cutting ""mini-budget"" left pension funds on the verge of collapse and sent the pound to an all-time low.Markets have stabilized somewhat since the instalment of former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak as prime minister. His return to a more conservative fiscal policy has in turn eased pressure on the Bank to act even more aggressively on inflation."

2022-11-07,"Amazon and Microsoft plunged after recent earnings on weaker corporate growth for cloud computing, but Gartner says tech demand will rise 5.1% next year.The Covid demand surge has glutted the market, and new applications aren’t driving upgrades.Still, third-quarter GDP showed stronger spending on tech equipment than expected, and intellectual property investment has been resilient. After the recent earnings from big technology companies and the mounting layoff headlines in the sector, tech investors can be excused for feeling a little confused: Is the tech-led economy about to fall off a recessionary cliff?Stocks like Amazon.com and Microsoft got pounded after missing analysts' growth forecast for their cloud computing businesses, which rely on corporations' demand for technology and innovation. They are also among the tech giants announcing hiring freezes and job cuts. The path of tech demand has been one of the key questions as markets try to handicap the odds of a 2023 recession. But the latest report on third-quarter gross domestic product had investment in equipment and intellectual property rising–including tech hardware and software.Experts say the likely conclusion is that tech demand keeps growing — and that companies across the economy will continue to see technology change the nature of their businesses and workers see technology change their jobs. Whether that offsets weakness elsewhere in the economy is another question. Amazon said in its third-quarter analyst call that weakness in industries such as banking and cryptocurrency is translating into lower demand, as the Covid pandemic bump in demand from companies and workers adjusting to remote work has slowed. ""CEOs and CFOs have no intention of cutting tech spending,"" said Gartner chief forecaster John-David Lovelock. ""Chief information officers are still wearing their halo from 2020, and CEOs are going back to the people who gave them the last set of solutions.'' CNBC's first-ever Top Startups for the Enterprise listTop Startups for the Enterprise 2022: The full listHow we chose the companies Top Startups for the Enterprise 2022: The full listHow we chose the companies On the bright side, the GDP report painted a picture of fairly strong technology demand, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Michael Gapen. The shortfall in investment spending was driven by a sharp decline in residential investment, he said.""The surprise, if anything, was that equipment spending was stronger'' than expected, Gapen said. ""Investment in that category is going to be persistent. If we have a risk, it's that this grows at a slower rate. It would take a severe recession for this to decline.""Demand has stayed strong for both hardware and software. For intellectual property, investment fell 3.6% in 2009 but has risen an average of 10 percent annually in 2021 and 2022, Gapen noted.Tech spending overall will rise about 5.1% next year after a gain of less than 1 percent this year, according to a new survey by Gartner, which is nearly unchanged from surveys earlier this year, and reflects executives' knowledge that companies that cut investment during the 2008 financial crisis badly lagged competitors in years that followed, Lovelock said. ""Data has come in right around our forecast, except for consumer devices, which have been a little lower,"" Lovelock said. Both semiconductors and consumer devices are working off a situation where heavy demand in 2020 cannot be sustained, after workers bolstered their home offices, resulting in households having relatively new gear on hand with few compelling new applications to spur upgrades, he said.Growth in cloud computing, the highest-profile category of technology investment in recent years, has slowed only a small amount and was destined to come down from its initial hyper growth stage, Lovelock said. Gartner expects cloud computing revenues to rise $101 billion next year — more than the $90 billion in 2021, but representing a smaller percentage of growth. In percentage terms, cloud spending will rise by about 20 percent for the next two to three years, according to Gartner's forecast.""If Microsoft (cloud services business) was growing 50 percent and now it's 35, it's hard to say that's bad news,"" he said.   Microsoft acknowledged that some customers are trimming budgets, resulting in revenue forecasts for the coming quarter that disappointed the markets, but said demand for their faster-growing services should be helped by cost pressures. That's because cloud computing is usually cheaper than solutions it replaces. Amazon added that it can move some clients to cheaper versions of its cloud services that use less expensive chips, for example. ""As a CFO, I appreciate that, and we're doing the same thing here at Amazon,"" Amazon chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said after its earnings.The problems of enterprise technology companies are very different than those that depend mostly on consumer spending, like Apple, or on advertising spending, like Meta Platforms, parent of Facebook.  Apple, which beat quarterly projections for the September quarter, has seen its stock fare better than peers, though it warned over the weekend that China's Zero Covid policy and outbreaks at Foxconn are going to significantly impact new iPhone production. Facebook, hampered by big early losses on its metaverse investment that Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney says may shave $5 a share from 2024 earnings and declining engagement with its core social media platforms, saw shares tank after its third-quarter report and is now reportedly getting ready to announce major layoffs. Overall, tech industry profits will grow about 2 percent this year, rebounding to 6 percent growth in 2023, CFRA Research estimates.That will reflect a split between rising sectors like cloud computing and legacy producers, many of them in software, that are scrambling to keep customers who are shifting toward web-based products, said CFRA tech analyst John Freeman. Before this year, cloud revenues were still about 40 percent of those in enterprise software, he said, suggesting that there is room for much more change in the industry – and in the experience of non-tech workers who will shift to new ways of working.""Nothing has changed in the fundamental technology outlook,"" Freeman said. ""It has improved, actually. Once macro risks are eventually settled into, people will go forward because companies have to become more agile. This [slowdown] is going to be much more painful for those with a reliance on legacy software.""The continuing shift in technology spending toward internet-based technology will mean challenges for companies that are moving to the cloud as fast as they can, Freeman said. Oracle, for example, gets more than 30 percent of revenue from cloud products, and executives said in September that the company's growth will accelerate as it becomes more cloud-focused. Microsoft will juggle the impact of its fast-growing cloud businesses and other businesses, such as LinkedIn and the Bing internet browser, and a measured decline in its legacy Windows business, Freeman said. Other legacy software players, as in the recently completed merger of Tibco Software and Citrix Systems, may go private and work out their transitions away from the glare of public markets, he said.But for companies spending on tech and their workers, the pace of change is unlikely to slow, Lovelock said.""The pace of change will never be this slow again,"" he said."
2022-11-07,"Oil prices fell on Monday, paring gains after rising to more than two-month highs, on mixed signals over China, the world's top crude importer, potentially relaxing its strict COVID-19 restrictions.Brent crude futures last fell 56 cents to $98.01 a barrel.

It earlier rose 74 cents to a session high of $93.74 a barrel, the highest since Aug. 30.Prices climbed during the session on news that Chinese leaders are considering reopening the economy from strict COVID-19 restrictions but are proceeding slowly and have set no timeline, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.""The market seems to be thinking that if China opens the economy, that would tighten supply significantly and put further upward pressure on prices,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group.However, weighing on futures, Chinese health officials at the weekend reiterated their commitment to strict COVID containment measures.Meanwhile, China's imports and exports contracted unexpectedly in October, but its crude oil imports rebounded to the highest level since May.Adding some price support, the U.S. dollar sank against the euro on Monday and sterling was supported by risk-on sentiment and a rally in European stock markets. A weakening dollar makes greenback-denominated oil less expensive for other currency holders, helping push prices higher.Oil prices have also been underpinned by expectations of tighter supplies when the European Union's embargo on Russia's seaborne crude exports starts on Dec. 5, even though refineries worldwide are ramping up output.""For a lot of folks, it looks like there is going to be a scramble for barrels come December, in particular in the euro zone,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.U.S. oil refiners this quarter will run their plants at breakneck rates, near or above 90% of capacity.

2022-11-08,"A U.S. recession is ""quite likely"" next year, former Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said Tuesday.Rosengren told CNBC that interest rates may need to rise to 5.5%, higher than the level expected by investors, to stem inflation.Rosengren also said that the unemployment rate would need to rise to 5%-5.5%. A U.S. recession is ""quite likely"" next year as persistent inflationary pressures force the Federal Reserve to shift interest rates higher than expected, former Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said Tuesday.Rosengren told CNBC that the U.S. central bank now looked likely to increase its terminal policy rate — the level at which it will stop raising interest rates — to more than the 5% forecast by investors, pushing the economy into a mild downturn in 2023.""I think it's quite likely the U.S. has a mild recession next year,"" Rosengren told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche at a UBS conference in London.Asked to put a figure on the possible terminal rate, Rosengren said: ""More than 5.5% would be my expectation.""The Fed, at its latest policy meeting last week, raised interest rates by 75 basis points to a target rate of 3.75%-4%, and hinted that rate rises could go further than previously outlined, albeit at a slower pace.Following the announcement, traders bet the terminal rate would reach 5.09% by May from just over 5% before the meeting. However, Rosengren, who retired from his post last year, said his elevated rate prediction — based on both Fed forecasts and his own calculations — was contingent on a weakening of the U.S. labor market and a slowdown in nominal wage growth.For interest rates to peak at 5.5% next year, Rosenberg said the unemployment rate would likely need to hit 5%-5.5%, up from 3.7% today and above the Fed's 4.4% forecast.The U.S. labor market has remained persistently tight over recent months, putting upward pressure on wages. Wage growth rose 5.2% annually in October, well above the 3.5% that would be consistent with the Fed's goal of returning inflation to 2%, according to Rosengren.""You're going to need that to get the wage growth down to be consistent with the 2% inflation rate they need,"" he said. The Fed's efforts to get a handle on soaring inflation, which remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in September, could be further complicated by the results of Tuesday's midterm elections.Currently, Republicans are favored to win control of the House, while the race for the Senate control appears tight. If a Republican win proves accurate, Rosengren said that could pile the pressure on the Fed to alter its course if the U.S. economy did enter a downturn.""If we go into a recession, it means we're going to be more reliant on monetary policy easing because you're not going to have the fiscal stimulus package you might otherwise have,"" Rosengren said.""The challenge will be if the economy starts to go down, how comfortable the Fed is given that fiscal policy's not likely to react to a weakening labor market,"" he added."

2022-11-08,"The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee raised interest rates by 75 basis points last week, its largest hike since 1989, despite warning that the British economy is facing its longest recession since records began.Chief Economist Huw Pill voiced concerns that the central bank would be blamed for the U.K. recession, and defended the MPC's efforts to contain inflation. LONDON — Bank of England policymakers are not ""inflation nutters"" but tightening of monetary policy is necessary to prevent surging prices becoming entrenched in the economy, the central bank's Chief Economist Huw Pill said Tuesday.The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee raised interest rates by 75 basis points last week, its largest hike since 1989, despite warning that the British economy is facing its longest recession since records began.""We're not meant to be inflation nutters. We are meant to sort of manage this trade-off in a way that avoids unnecessary, counterproductive maybe, disruptions to the real economy,"" Pill said at a conference organized by Swiss bank UBS.Alongside its policy announcement last week, the Bank took the unusual step of challenging the market's pricing for future interest rate hikes, suggesting the terminal rate will likely be below market expectations.Pill said he was ""skeptical"" that front-loading rate hikes would help to temper expectations and produce an ""immaculate disinflation"" without any real cost to the economy. The Bank of England has come under criticism for being too slow off the mark in its efforts to rein in sky-high inflation. ""I think, unfortunately, it is the case that the Phillips curve has not disappeared. There's a debate to be had about what the slope of the Phillips curve is and how that's changing, but the Phillips curve has not disappeared, and the weakening of the economy is to some extent, a necessary part of the disinflation you need to see,"" he said.The Phillips curve is an economic model that argues that inflation and unemployment have an inverse correlation.Pill also emphasized that the weakening of the U.K. economy thus far was not solely caused by monetary policy, with external factors such as surging energy prices and supply shocks eating into household income.""I think there's a danger, which we're aware of, that we at the Bank of England and the MPC will be blamed for the recession. The recession was actually driven by other forces, and we're trying to manage the adjustment to those other forces,"" Pill said.""One of the reasons for central banking independence is we don't have to be popular, we can still take the right decision, and I think taking the right decisions is what our core ambition should be."""
2022-11-09,"Tech jobs are in flux, tourism is at an all-time high, and the population across major U.S. cities is shifting.An October report by the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise, a business policy think tank, ranked the top 10 fastest-growing cities in the U.S.The ranking considered each city's county-level employment rates and economic output. And the final list is a good indication of where young people want to live and work and of what they value.For example, Seattle — which ranked number three on this year's list — is becoming a leader in clean energy. The city is moving forward with plans to enact new initiatives for cleaner buildings, according to the city's mayor, Bruce Harrell.The city is also home to tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft, and younger job-seekers are eager to work for a company that aligns with their values and has a vested interest in something such as environmental advocacy.Seattle also topped the list of cities where college students want to live after graduation, according to Axios and The Generation Lab's 2022 Next Cities Index.  Over the last 10 years, San Francisco has become synonymous with Silicon Valley, and after all this time, the city continues to grow.The tech hub starts in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area and also includes other cities such as San Mateo, Santa Clara, San Jose, Palo Alto, Cupertino and Mountain View.The shift to remote work after the pandemic hit caused many folks to move out of the area. And more recently some of the top tech companies have announced hiring freezes and layoffs.And though the news coming out of Silicon Valley has caused San Francisco's housing market to become one of the fastest declining in the nation, the city still landed the top spot with a 4.8% GDP growth in 2022.

2022-11-09,"The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the third-largest railroad worker union and one of the unions to reject the recent labor deal recommended by the Biden administration, announces an extension of negotiations.BMWED moved the end of its cooling-off period that includes talks with freight rail management from November 20 to December 4 in a move that allows the unions to ultimately align their strategy ahead of a potential strike.Key votes among BLET and SMART-TD union members to ratify the deal are set for Nov. 21, and the earliest a possible rail strike if voted down can happen is now December 9. The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division, the third largest rail union in the country, is extending its status quo period (no strike, no lockout) during which it wants to continue negotiations with the freight rail carriers.In a posting on its website, the BMWED union explained that it has moved the end of its cooling off period from Nov. 19 to Dec. 4, the same date on which the Brotherhood of Signalmen Union (BRS) — the other rail union to reject the proposed deal with railroad management recommended by the Biden administration — status quo period ends. The Signalman's union is having another meeting with the carriers Wednesday afternoon over their fight for paid sick time equivalent to that offered to federal contractors, which has been a primary sticking point in labor talks.  Meanwhile, two major rail unions are set to vote on ratifying the deal on Nov. 21: The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, and the Smart Transportation Division.""With this extension, BLET and SMART-TD will have the opportunity to finish their ratification procedures for any tentative national agreements without disruption. If these Unions do not ratify, then we will have the opportunity to bring all of Rail Labor together, under a single deadline, to finish national negotiations,"" the BMWED stated.A labor spokesperson explained to CNBC if the BLET or SMART-TD does not ratify, the ending of the new cooling-off period date would be December 8. That means the earliest a possible strike would happen is December 9.Freight industry trade group The Association of American Railroads, said in a release that this extension provides greater certainty for the economy, rail customers, and rail passengers planning to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday. The rail industry has previously estimated the cost to the economy of a rail strike at $2 billion per day.""This agreement to extend the cooling off period affords all unionized employees the opportunity to vote on their agreements free of a looming strike threat,"" said AAR President and CEO Ian Jefferies in the statement. ""Our goal remains the same – successfully completing this round of bargaining – and we stand ready to reach an agreement with BMWED based upon the Presidential Emergency Board's recommendations.""Union Pacific, Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern and the U.S. railroads owned by Canadian National are among the Class I freight railroads represented by the AAR.Industries across the U.S. economy are voicing their concerns. The National Association of Manufacturers posted on its website concerns about the impact of a railroad strike a segment of the economy still facing supply chain challenges.""Manufacturers are encouraged to see that all the unions have now agreed to extend the deadline for reaching and ratifying an agreement,"" Jay Timmons, CEO of National Association of Manufacturers, told CNBC. ""It provides some temporary breathing room for operational and logistical planning for manufacturers and delays any rail service interruptions. We hope that this extension will provide the additional time necessary for all parties to conclude a voluntary agreement, as has been our hope throughout. Any disruption to rail service would have devastating economic and inflationary effects, so in line with [U.S. Department of Labor] Secretary [Marty] Walsh's comments yesterday, we continue urging congressional leaders to be prepared to act should a work stoppage appear imminent.""Last Thursday, a group of nearly 200 agricultural trade groups known as the Agricultural Transportation Working Group and including the National Grain & Feed Association, sent a letter to Congress stating that a ""strike or lockout combined with existing challenges in the rail system, at our ports, with trucking and with record low water levels on the Mississippi River impacting numerous barge shipments would be catastrophic for the agricultural and broader U.S. economies.""""We are pleased to see the extension of the status quo from the union today,"" Jonathan Gold, National Retail Federation Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy, told CNBC . ""We encourage the parties to remain at the table and resolve the outstanding issues and avoid a strike that would impact the entire supply chain and harm the economy.""The BMWED was the first rail union to vote against ratification of a labor agreement negotiated in conjunction with Biden's PEB. All 12 labor unions must ratify a labor agreement to avoid the potential for a nationwide rail shutdown.Under the Railway Labor Act, Congress has the ability to impose the resolution from Biden's Presidential Emergency Board, or order the trains to operate as usual with an extension of negotiations.Richard Edelman, counsel for BMWED and chief spokesperson in the collective bargaining said a recent four-page joint proposal by the Brotherhood of Signalmen Union (BRS) and BMWED for paid sick leave was presented to the carriers, but the carriers said no.The BRS became the second union to reject the tentative agreement two weeks ago, with more than 60% of its members voting it down in the highest participation vote in its history. The unions to vote down the deal have consistently said that rail management is underestimating the frustration and anger of rail workers, especially when it comes to quality of life issues such as paid time off.Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz laughed during a recent CNBC ""Squawk on the Street"" interview when asked if the railroad was preparing for a possible strike. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves,"" Fritz said. ""We've got some negotiating to do with that union and we've agreed to status quo, we're in status quo while we're doing that. I am confident we will find a way to craft an agreement that can be taken back out for ratification. That doesn't mean a strike is not possible, it just means in my opinion I don't think it's probable. We've got plenty of runway to figure it out.""The agreement based upon President Biden's PEB recommendations includes the largest wage increases in nearly five decades and would lead to immediate payouts averaging more than $11,000 per railroader ahead of the holidays.In a letter prepared November 1 for railroad workers to send to their members of Congress and posted on BMWED's website, the union stated, ""We were told during the pandemic that we were classified as 'federal contractors' for purposes of the vaccine mandate. In turn, we are asking for the 56 hours of paid sick time off as prescribed currently to federal contractors.""Edelman said the recent union proposal rejected by the rails mirrors the executive order for federal contractors.""The absence of a recommendation for paid sick leave by PEB [Presidential Emergency Board] 250, and the carriers' refusal to agree to paid sick leave was a major factor for members who voted against ratification,"" Edelman said.In addition to sick pay, Edelman said because it typically takes years of negotiation for changes in agreements, members are voicing concern about wage increases keeping up with the cost of living, and their costs for health and welfare benefits.The AAR told CNBC it updated the leave policy explainer in mid-October. In a September report, the AAR quantified the impact of a strike on the supply chain and the U.S. economy at up to $2 billion a day.The BMWED has its paid sick time proposal to the NCCC on its website. "
2022-11-09,"Meta cut 11,000 jobs Wednesday in the biggest tech layoff of 2022.The tech industry has seen a string of layoffs this year in the face of uncertain economic conditions.Layoffs come as digital advertisers are cutting back on spending and rising inflation curbs consumer spending. The job cuts in tech land are piling up, as companies that led the 10-year stock bull market adapt to a new reality.Days after Twitter's new boss Elon Musk slashed half his company's workforce, Facebook parent Meta announced its most significant round of layoffs ever. Meta said on Wednesday that it's eliminating 13% of its staff, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees.Last month, Meta announced a second straight quarter of declining revenue and forecast another drop in the fourth quarter. Digital advertisers are cutting back on spending as rising inflation curbs consumer spending, and apps like Facebook are suffering from Apple's iOS privacy update, which limited ad targeting. The tech industry broadly has seen a string of layoffs in 2022 in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Here are the big ones that have been announced recently.  Meta's disappointing guidance for the fourth quarter wiped out one-fourth of the company's market cap and pushed the stock to its lowest since 2016.The company's Reality Labs division has lost $9.4 billion so far in this year due to CEO Mark Zuckerberg's commitment to the metaverse.Meta is rightsizing after expanding headcount by about 60% during the pandemic. The business has been hurt by competition from rivals such as TikTok, a broad slowdown in online ad spending and challenges from Apple's iOS changes.In a letter to employees, Zuckerberg said those losing their jobs will receive 16 weeks of pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service. Meta will cover health insurance for six months. Shortly after closing his $44 billion purchase of Twitter late last month, Musk cut around 3,700 Twitter employees, according to internal communications viewed by CNBC. That's about half the staff.In a post on Nov. 4, Musk said there was ""no choice"" but to lay off employees, adding that they were offered three months of severance.Musk said the layoffs come as Twitter is losing over $4 million per day. In the second quarter, the last time Twitter reported earnings, revenue fell 1% from a year earlier. Lyft announced last week that it cut 13% of its staff, or about 700 jobs. In a letter to employees, CEO Logan Green and President John Zimmer pointed to ""a probable recession sometime in the next year"" and rising rideshare insurance costs.For laid-off workers, the ride-hailing company promised 10 weeks of pay, healthcare coverage through the end of April, accelerated equity vesting for the Nov. 20 vesting date and recruiting assistance. Workers who had been there for more than four years will get an extra four weeks of pay, they added. Online payments giant Stripe laid off roughly 14% of its staff, which amounts to about 1,100 employees last week. CEO Patrick Collison wrote in a memo to staff that the cuts were necessary amid rising inflation, fears of a looming recession, higher interest rates, energy shocks, tighter investment budgets and sparser startup funding. Taken together, these factors signal ""that 2022 represents the beginning of a different economic climate,"" he said.Stripe said it will pay 14 weeks of severance for all departing employees, and more for those with longer tenure. It will also pay the cash equivalent of six months of existing healthcare premiums or healthcare continuation.Stripe was valued at $95 billion last year, and reportedly lowered its internal valuation to $74 billion in July. In June, Coinbase announced it cut 18% of full-time jobs, translating to a reduction of around 1,100 people.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong pointed to a possible recession, a need to manage costs and growing ""too quickly"" during a bull market. Coinbase, which held its stock market debut, has lost over 80% of its value this year, cratering alongside cryptocurrencies.Those laid off received a minimum of 14 weeks of severance plus an additional 2 weeks for every year of employment beyond one year. They also were offered four months of COBRA health insurance in the U.S., and four months of mental health support globally, according to the company's announcement.  In July, Shopify announced it laid off 1,000 workers, which equals 10% of its global employees. In a memo to staff, CEO Tobi Lutke acknowledged he had misjudged how long the pandemic-driven e-commerce boom would last, and said the company is being hit by a broader pullback in online spending. The company's stock price is down 78% in 2022.Shopify said employees who are laid off will receive 16 weeks of severance pay, plus one week for every year of tenure at the company. Netflix announced two rounds of layoffs. In May the streaming service eliminated 150 jobs after Netflix reported its first subscriber loss in a decade. In late June Netflix announced another 300 layoffs. In a statement to employees the company said, ""While we continue to invest significantly in the business, we made these adjustments so that our costs are growing in line with our slower revenue growth."" Netflix's stock is down 58% this year. In October, Microsoft confirmed that it let go of less than 1% of employees. The cuts impacted fewer than 1,000 people, according to an Axios report which cited an unnamed person. The announcement came after Microsoft called for the slowest revenue growth in more than five years in the quarter that ended Sept. 30. In late August, Snap announced it laid off 20% of its workforce, which equates to over 1,000 employees. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel told employees in a memo that the company needs to restructure its business to deal with its financial challenges. He said the company's current year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter of 8% ""is well below what we were expecting earlier this year.""Snap has lost 80% of its value this year. Retail brokerage firm Robinhood cut 23% of its staff in August, after slashing 9% of its workforce in April. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev blamed ""deterioration of the macro environment, with inflation at 40-year highs accompanied by a broad crypto market crash.""The stock is down by more than half in 2022. Earlier this month, Fintech company Chime laid off 12% of its workforce, or about 160 employees. A Chime spokesperson told CNBC that the so-called challenger bank – a fintech firm that exclusively offers banking services through websites and smartphone apps – is cutting 12% of its 1,300-person workforce. The company said that while it's eliminating approximately 160 employees, it's still hiring for select positions and remains ""very well capitalized.""Private investors valued Chime at $25 billion just over a year ago. In June, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in an email to all employees that the company is cutting 10% of salaried workers.""Tesla will be reducing salaried headcount by 10% as we have become overstaffed in many areas,"" Musk wrote. ""Note this does not apply to anyone actually building cars, battery packs or installing solar. Hourly headcount will increase.""WATCH: Meta lays off 13% of staff, cuts discretionary spending"
2022-11-10,"Here are the most important news items that investors need to start their trading day: Markets sold off Wednesday as investors sought something solid to hold onto during this uncertain time. The midterm elections might not have yielded a GOP ""red wave,"" but control of Congress is still up in the air. Companies are still churning through earnings reports – big retailers are up next week – and there are some major economic data points to digest as the Federal Reserve pushes ahead with its battle against inflation. The consumer price index grew less than expected in October, although it was still hot. ""As everyone knows, markets really don't like uncertainty,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance, according to CNBC's markets live blog. Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire needed a savior. For a day, it looked like Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the world's biggest crypto firm, Binance, would be his white knight. Binance said it would prop up Bankman-Fried's liquidity-squeezed FTX. But then ... nevermind, said Binance. ""In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX's customers to provide liquidity,"" Binance said Wednesday. ""But the issues are beyond our control or ability to help."" Now, FTX, which was valued at $32 billion earlier this year, is on the brink of a wipeout – a stunning fall from grace for Bankman-Fried and his company, which itself had become known as a savior to failing crypto firms. Job cuts at big banks are picking up steam, as deal-making remains frozen in market conditions beset by uncertainty and rising interest rates, according to CNBC's Hugh Son. Citigroup and Barclays rolled out dozens of layoffs this week, following hundreds of cuts at Goldman Sachs in September and ongoing terminations at struggling Credit Suisse. JPMorgan Chase is looking to potential job cuts at the end of the year as it seeks to shrink costs, and Morgan Stanley is also examining possible layoffs. ""Most of the banks are budgeting for declines in revenue next year,"" a person involved with providing data and analytics to the banking industry told CNBC. Russian forces are withdrawing from Kherson, in the southern part of Ukraine. It's the latest embarrassing defeat for Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Russia's former Soviet neighbor. Kherson was one of the areas Russia claimed in its illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory. Knowing the area's importance to Russia, Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelenskyy greeted the news of the withdrawal with caution and wondered whether Putin's armies were setting a trap. He also said, without offering further detail, that his forces are planning more operations to force Russian troops off Ukrainian soil. Read live war updates here. $1.5 billion? In this economy?

2022-11-10,"Tens of thousands of tech workers have been laid off within days, as tech giants including Meta, Twitter, Salesforce and others shed headcount going into the final stretch of the year. At least 20,300 U.S. tech workers were let go from their jobs in November, and more than 100,000 since the beginning of the year, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks layoffs in the field.Tech workers reported huge drops in confidence in their job security through the summer, as news of layoffs, hiring freezes and rescinded offers put a damper on what's so far been a worker-driven Covid pandemic recovery.But the latest headlines are all converging at once as businesses course-correct on over-hiring and acknowledge how rising interest rates are thwarting their growth plans, says ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak.She says layoff numbers, even in the thousands, are ""not surprising"" given how the Fed's raising of interest rates has made it harder for companies to borrow, caused stock prices to dip and makes U.S. products too expensive for foreign markets.The latest economic volatility disproportionately affects tech and could impact other downstream industries, Pollak adds. Tech sector cuts will have a ripple effect: Fewer companies prepare to go public, so investment banks take a hit. Companies work to quickly conserve cash by slashing advertising spending, which also impacts media companies. Companies reduce their workforce and suddenly don't need HR staff and recruiters anymore.And junior-level workers will be hardest hit ""as companies tighten their hiring needs and focus on experienced talent when filling new roles,"" says Josh Brenner, CEO of the tech jobs marketplace Hired.With all that said, layoffs have ""so far been concentrated in narrow industries in Silicon Valley and Wall Street,"" Pollak says, and are ""still offset by tremendous economic resilience on Main Street,"" where employers are struggling to hire to keep pace with consumer demand in travel, hospitality, leisure and other service sectors.Hiring is still strong despite economic headwinds, according to the Labor Department's latest jobs report, and Pollak says employers are adding 60% more jobs each month than prior to Covid. Jobs in health care and within major enterprises of 5,000-plus workers are doing especially well. Layoffs remain historically low at 1.3 million, or under 1% of the workforce, and there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker.Pollak says that as of October, 2022 is the best year on record (since 2000) for having the lowest number of layoffs per month. That could change in the last months of the year, at which point it could fall just behind 2021's record-low layoff numbers.Even with tens of thousands of tech workers laid off this month, ""in aggregate, it's still largely offset by what's happening in blue collar industries and manual service industries where companies are hoarding workers and very reluctant to let them go,"" Pollak says. Newly laid off workers will face more competition on the job market, which since 2021 has favored workers able to negotiate for big pay raises, better hours, flexible schedules and generally better jobs.With that said, Pollak says, ""many tech companies with strong profit margins are seeing their revenue grow or are holding steady, and are still continuing to hire. At companies struggling to find talent in the last year, talent acquisition teams are sitting at the ready to download the spreadsheets listing laid-off workers and start making calls.""Brenner agrees, referencing Hired's 2022 state of tech salaries report showing ""the window to acquire tech talent has narrowed, and employers continue to widen their talent pipelines to ensure they get the top talent needed.""Tech workers, and workers at tech companies, will still have lots of job opportunities at smaller companies and outside the tech industry, Pollak says — including health care, retail, the government and even agriculture. Tech job seekers on Hired are also flocking to financial services jobs, Brenner adds.Most tech job seekers stay within the industry, but they have other options. According to ZipRecruiter data, 74% of tech workers who started a new job within the last six months stayed within the tech sector, according to an October survey of 2,500 Americans.Among the 26% who found work in other industries, 6% went into retail or e-commerce, 5% went to work for a financial tech company, 2% moved to health care, and 2% moved to professional business services.""Workers will likely have to take less attractive offers than they found in the heart of the tech sector,"" she adds, ""but these will continue to be relatively highly paid jobs with attractive career growth prospects, enormous flexibility and autonomy.""A final thought, Pollak adds, is how tech-sector tumult could motivate some people to start their own companies.""Many of today's best household-name tech companies started in the shadow of the Great Recession,"" she says, such as Airbnb, Uber and Dropbox. ""This is obviously not the best financing environment to start a company, but we could still see some people becoming entrepreneurial through necessity. With a lot of tech geniuses dumped out on street at once, they might find each other and build the scrappy tech startup that could become the next FAANG company.""Want to earn more and work less? Register for the free CNBC Make It: Your Money virtual event on Dec. 13 at 12 p.m. ET to learn from money masters like Kevin O'Leary how you can increase your earning power.Check out:Sharing your layoff on LinkedIn isn't an 'act of shame' anymore—and it could be a smart career move$2 million ranges, deleted job posts: NYC's salary transparency law is off to a rocky startCold and flu season is here, and people are showing up to work sick again"

Shelter costs posted their highest monthly gain since 1990.Markets soared on the report and Treasury yields tumbled. The consumer price index rose less than expected in October, an indication that while inflation is still a threat to the U.S. economy, pressures could be starting to cool.The index, a broad-based measure of goods and services costs, increased 0.4% for the month and 7.7% from a year ago, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics release Thursday. Respective estimates from Dow Jones were for rises of 0.6% and 7.9%.Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core CPI increased 0.3% for the month and 6.3% on an annual basis, compared with respective estimates of 0.5% and 6.5%.  A 2.4% decline in used vehicle prices helped bring down the inflation figures. Apparel prices fell 0.7% and medical care services were lower by 0.6%.""The report overstates the case that inflation is coming in, but it makes a case inflation is coming in,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""It's pretty clear that inflation has definitely peaked and is rolling over. All the trend lines suggest that it will continue to moderate going forward, assuming that nothing goes off the rails.""Markets reacted sharply to the report, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 1,000 points. Treasury yields fell sharply, with the policy-sensitive 2-year note tumbling 0.3 percentage point to 4.33%.""The trend in inflation is a welcome development, so that's great news in terms of the report,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""However, investors are still gullible and they are still impatiently waiting for the Powell pivot, and I'm not sure it's coming anytime soon. So I think this morning's enthusiasm is a bit of an overreaction.""The ""Powell pivot"" comment refers to market expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his central bank colleagues soon will slow or stop the aggressive pace of interest rate increases they've been deploying to try to bring down inflation.Even with the slowdown in the inflation rate, it still remains well above the Fed's 2% target, and several areas of the report show that the cost of living remains high.""One month of data does not a victory make, and I think it's really important to be thoughtful that this is just one piece of positive information, but we're looking at a whole set of information,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said in response to the CPI data.""We have to be resolute to bring inflation down to 2% on average,"" she added in a Q&A with the European Economics & Financial Centre. ""That's our goal, that's what Americans depend on, and that's what we're committed to doing. So we're going to continue to adjust policy until that job is fully done.""Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI, rose 0.8% for the month, the largest monthly gain since 1990, and up 6.9% from a year ago, their highest annual level since 1982. Also, fuel oil prices exploded 19.8% higher for the month and are up 68.5% on a 12-month basis. The food index rose 0.6% for the month and 10.9% annually, while energy was up 1.8% and 17.6%, respectively.Because of the rise in inflation, workers took another pay cut in October. Real average hourly earnings declined 0.1% for the month and were down 2.8% on an annual basis, according to a separate BLS release.A separate Labor Department report Thursday showed that jobless claims rose to 225,000 last week, an increase of 7,000 from the previous week.The latest inflation reading comes as Federal Reserve officials have been deploying a series of aggressive interest rate hikes in an effort to bring down inflation running around its highest levels since the early 1980s.In early November, the central bank approved its fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase, taking its benchmark rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level in 14 years. Markets expect the Fed to continue raising, though at a possibly slower pace ahead before the fed funds rate tops out around 5% early next year.Traders quickly changed their expectations regarding the Fed's next move. Futures tied to the fed funds rate indicated an 80.6% probability of a 0.5 percentage point move in December, up from 56.8% a day ago, according to CME Group data.""One data point doesn't make a trend. What we have to hope for is we get another downtick [in CPI] with the next report, which happens the day before the next Fed meeting,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.

2022-11-11,"FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms, is in major financial turmoil.At its peak, FTX was valued at $32 billion. The company filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11 after competing offshore crypto exchange, Binance, backed out of a deal to acquire it and users withdrew around $6 billion in funds.FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, who often goes by SBF, stepped down as CEO on Friday. He saw his estimated net worth drop by billions virtually overnight as his cryptocurrency exchange platform teeters on the brink of collapse.Between Nov. 8-9, Bankman-Fried's net worth plummeted to $991.5 million. That's around a 94% drop from his estimated $15.2 billion previously, according to a Bloomberg analysis.""The fall of FTX could be the moment that really kicks off the broader decline — maybe even demise — of cryptocurrency,"" James Royal, principal reporter at Bankrate, tells CNBC Make It. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, initially invested in FTX in 2019, but later sold his controlling stake in 2021, Reuters reports.Zhao was paid about $2.1 billion worth of FTT, the native crypto token that gives users access to the FTX trading platform.Here's why that matters: A leaked balance sheet revealed that the value of Bankman-Fried's crypto trading firm, Alameda Research, was heavily reliant on the value of FTT, according to Coindesk.So when Zhao announced on Nov. 6 that his company would liquidate any remaining FTT it held due to ""recent revelations,"" it triggered fears among investors that FTX would be unable to pay its debts.Many began to withdraw their funds, which led to a stark 72% drop in FTT's price. As FTT's price fell, so did the value of FTX's assets that were tied to it. ""The first thing traders need to do now is understand the legal duty that an exchange has to them, and whether their assets are held securely,"" Royal says.Like many other crypto exchanges, FTX's insurance coverage only addresses certain criminal events such as theft or fraud, Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist at MarketVector Indexes, tells CNBC Make it.""There is no insurance coverage just because the exchange fails,"" he says. ""If there's no bailout, depositors in FTX could lose everything."" In short, it doesn't look good. ""The events shook the broader cryptocurrency markets, sending bitcoin and other currencies to two-year lows,"" Leinweber says.Bitcoin's price hovered around $17,000 as of Nov. 11, down from above $20,000 on Nov. 8 and well below the peak price of around $68,000 it reached in November 2021.""With the exception of so-called stablecoins, crypto prices are supported entirely by belief in their future, not by any fundamental underpinning such as assets or cash flow,"" Royal says.That means crypto's value solely depends on what someone is willing to pay for it, which is why its price can be subject to erratic fluctuations and dips.""Crypto has been seen as a lottery ticket, and hypesters have been pumping crypto for years,"" Royal says. ""Unfortunately, it usually takes massive losses for the scales to fall from traders' eyes.""Don't miss: California isn’t the No. 1 state for cryptocurrency enthusiasts—but it still ranks in the top 7"
2022-11-11,"While there was a shortage of containers at the height of the Covid pandemic, the global economy is now facing the opposite problem: too many containers. Traders and shippers say the decline in global consumer demand is not a sign the global economy is normalizing after a frantic post-lockdown consumption rush but a downward shift in consumption appetites.  Blank or canceled sailings are also on the rise in what is usually the opposite, as the year's biggest spending period approaches. While there was a shortage of containers at the height of the Covid pandemic, the global economy is now facing the opposite problem: too many containers. On top of falling freight rates, data shows container depots — used to house containers after they are unloaded — are now filling up or full.It points to more signs of falling global demand and an impending economic slowdown.Traders and shippers say the decline in global consumer demand is not a sign the global economy is normalizing after a frantic post-lockdown consumption rush but a downward shift in consumption appetites.   ""There is just not enough depot space to accommodate all the containers,"" online container logistics platform Container xChange chief executive Christian Roeloffs said in an industry update this week. ""With the further release of container inventory into the market, for example from the disposal of leasing fleets, there will be added pressure on depots in the coming months."" Italian container depot owner Sogese chief executive Andrea Monti told Container xChange his depots are full. ""Whatever was coming in and out of, for instance, our Milan depot is quite stuck. And the container volume at the depots is increasing to an extent that we are returning some requests for depot service agreements."" ""We are in a situation where we are not able to accept new clients for some locations."" Monti told Container xChange that the peak season of goods shipments — as Christmas looms — ""technically did not happen this year."" Retailers are cautious about the high level of inventory they have on hand, Monti said. ""There is enough inventory with retailers,"" Monti said. ""What has happened now is that the cargo is 'on time' again and hence you'll see a slowdown in new ordering as companies adjust to more efficient turnaround times in ocean freight delivery.""To combat full and overflowing depots, ports such as the Port of Houston have started levying fees for empty containers sitting in terminals for more than seven days, according to global claims management provider Sedgwick's national marine manager, Darin Miller.""What many don't realize is a lot of the time, the containers within the depots are empty,"" he told CNBC.""Often left sitting for weeks on end, the sheer number of containers on ships or at ports, leaves us with insufficient depot space which only exacerbates our ongoing supply chain crisis as it impacts container repositioning and movement.""Consumers can expect retailers to offer discounts in order to clear inventory, Miller added.The latest Drewry composite World Container Index — a key benchmark for container prices — has fallen again to $2,773 per 40-foot container. That's 73% lower than the peak rate in September last year. Blank or canceled sailings are also on the rise in what is usually the opposite, as the year's biggest spending period approaches.A blank sailing happens when a shipping company decides to skip a port or an entire leg of its schedule to manage changes in demand and capacity. In its latest canceled sailings analysis, Drewry said between late November and early December, 14% of sailings have been canceled across major container shipping routes. Last week, major shipping group Maersk warned in its third-quarter results that freight rates have peaked amid easing supply chain congestion and falling demand. The company told investors to expect lower ocean shipping profits.Nearly 60% of the 200 freight forwarders, traders and shippers that Container xChange spoke to in a survey last month said they were grappling with geopolitical, economic and political risks which have imposed downward pressures on consumption and therefore demand for containers.   ""We know already that the market is bearish on consumer demand because of multiple factors like recessionary fears and inflationary risks,"" a Container xChange spokeswoman told CNBC. ""So of course, there is a significant dent in consumer demand which then leads to less demand for freight and cargo, and therefore, a proportionate dent in container demand globally.""Shippers are giving containers away to reduce crowding at depots while many have resorted to blank sailings, Container xChange added."

World leaders are kicking off a meeting Tuesday on the holiday island of Bali, Indonesia as the global economy grapples with a looming recession, central banks' jumbo rate hikes and historically high inflation.The annual meeting of leaders from the world's major economies, known as the Group of 20 nations, is also taking place as Russia's war in Ukraine drags on and relations between Washington and Beijing remain tense.The gathering of officials that represent more than 80% of global GDP and 75% of exports worldwide marks the 17th meeting since the the platform kicked off after the Asian financial crisis in 1999 as a meeting for finance ministry officials and central bank leaders. Nineteen countries and one economic region, the European Union, will attend this year's two-day G-20 meeting.This year's in-person attendee list has been in the spotlight as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues his unprovoked war in Ukraine.Putin will not be attending the summit and will instead be represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who walked out of a G-20 foreign minister meeting in July as his global counterparts called for an end to the war in Ukraine. Reuters reported Putin may join virtually.U.S. President Joe Biden is also scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping ahead of the G-20. Other attendees include newly appointed U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Saudi Arabia's crown prince and de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman, who recently led an OPEC+ initiative to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day to shore up prices. Not much progress is expected from Biden and Xi's meeting, according to Andrew Staples, Asia Pacific director of Economist Impact, the policy and insights arm of The Economist Group.""Expectations are not very high,"" he told CNBC's Martin Soong, adding that ongoing geopolitical tensions are dragging down global growth.

2022-11-14,"Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos once again warned of the challenges of an economic recession.He urged consumers and small business owners to reduce their risk by holding cash and delaying big purchases.Many executives have recently warned of difficult economic times ahead, with a fresh wave of layoffs and cost cutting measures taking effect over the past weeks. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once again warned of the challenges of an economic recession, telling consumers and small business owners they should reduce their risk by hanging onto cash and delaying big purchases.""The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon,"" Bezos said in an interview with CNN released on Sunday. ""My advice to people whether they're small business owners is take some risk off the table. If you were going to make a purchase, maybe slow down that purchase a little bit. Keep some dry powder on hand and wait a bit.""The comments build on Bezos' warning last month that it was time to ""batten down the hatches."" Bezos made that statement on Twitter in response to a CNBC clip of Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon predicting there's a good chance there will be a recession. Many executives have recently warned of difficult economic times ahead, with a fresh wave of layoffs and cost cutting measures taking effect over the past weeks. Amazon has made cutbacks, including canceled or delayed new warehouses and a hiring freeze.In the CNN interview, Bezos said he doesn't know if it's ""technically"" a recession yet, but said, ""What I can tell you is the economy does not look great right now, things are slowing down, you're seeing layoffs in many many sectors of the economy, people are slowing down.""He added that consumers and business owners should ""play the probabilities for a bit"" by keeping cash on hand and delaying buying a new TV, car or piece of equipment.It's difficult to predict when the downturn will end, Bezos said, so ""you just have to try and be reasonable about it, take as much risk off the table as you can for yourself.

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday said that there's enough pain in the market for the Federal Reserve to consider easing its pace of interest rate hikes.""There's enough turmoil that the Fed needs to slow down its rate hikes, if only to prevent the headwinds from turning into some sort of weird [Category] 5 hurricane,"" he said.Stocks fell on Monday, snapping last week's streak of gains, as investors mulled over corporate and economic news that sent mixed signals about the state of the economy.Amazon reportedly plans to lay off around 10,000 workers starting this week, which would be its largest headcount cut in history. The cuts would make the e-commerce giant the latest tech firm to curtail its workforce this year to slash costs in a worsening economic environment.A bright spot during the trading session was Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard's indication that the central bank could soon reduce its pace of raising interest rates.Cramer pointed to the reported layoffs at Amazon and turmoil in other sectors like crypto and software stocks as examples of the Fed's damage. ""The Fed's already done a great deal of damage to the economy, it's just that it's all packed into the most bloated sectors,"" he said.He added that consumers are also starting to feel the weight of the Fed's interest rate hikes, especially as the number of companies laying off their workers increases.""Other than travel, people aren't really doing much.

2022-11-15,"Hunt is expected to announce tax rises and spending cuts totaling between £50 billion ($58.85 billion) and £60 billion per year as he tries to plug a substantial hole in the country's public finances.The Bank of England has projected that the U.K. is at the beginning of its longest recession on record. And the Office for National Statistics confirmed on Friday that GDP contracted by 0.2% in the third quarter of 2022. LONDON — New British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt must weigh the country's economic peril against his party's political survival on Thursday as he delivers a long-awaited fiscal statement.Hunt is expected to announce tax rises and spending cuts totaling between £50 billion ($58.85 billion) and £60 billion per year as he attempts to plug a substantial hole in the country's public finances, while reassuring the market of its fiscal credibility after the chaos unleashed by former Prime Minister Liz Truss' disastrous ""mini-budget"" in late September.The Bank of England has projected that the U.K. is at the beginning of its longest recession on record, and the Office for National Statistics confirmed on Friday that GDP contracted by 0.2% in the third quarter of 2022.The Bank is also attempting to wrestle inflation back down to target from the 40-year high of 10.1% seen in September, and earlier this month imposed its largest hike to interest rates since 1989.""We are going to see everyone paying more tax. We're going to see spending cuts,"" Hunt told the BBC on Sunday, while also promising the government would deliver a new and more focused plan to help with household energy bills beyond April.Reports have suggested that many of the most radical austerity measures earmarked by new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government will take effect from 2025 onwards, after the next general election. ""The government and the Bank of England find themselves in a very difficult position, because the choice for the chancellor next week is not so much about what's going to happen — he's already told the market that the debt forecast needs to be coming down over the next few years — it's rather the timing,"" Hugh Gimber, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC on Friday.He added that Hunt faces a key decision between frontloading the pain Sunak's government has promised to rebalance the economy and delaying the major impact of the new measures in order to prevent further political damage, at risk of prolonging the crisis.""At the moment, you can make a strong case economically to say frontload it, bring it forward, reduce the amount that the Bank of England has to do in terms of trying to slow the economy down, but politically, clearly there's a difficult challenge there,"" Gimber said.Most electoral polling in recent weeks gives the main opposition Labour Party around a 20 point lead over Sunak's ruling Conservatives, indicating that the damage suffered under Truss' 45-day tenure, and the series of scandals that plagued her predecessor Boris Johnson, has not been unwound by Sunak's promise of a return to fiscal credibility.Spending cuts vs. tax hikesThursday's statement will be accompanied by a long-awaited set of projections from the U.K.'s independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), and following the Bank of England's grim outlook a couple of weeks ago, economists expect a similarly bleak picture to emerge.In a note Monday, Deutsche Bank said the OBR will likely project a ""deep and protracted recession"" in 2023, with growth remaining muted until 2025 at the earliest and inflation projections rising significantly to reflect more persistent price increases.Deutsche also expects the OBR to forecast a slow recovery of the country's tight labor market, with unemployment rising to around 5.5-6% over the next two to three years. ""All up, the challenging economic outlook will likely underscore the main reason for the size of the fiscal hole, with our borrowing projections pushing a little above GBP 90bn in 2026/27 (OBR Spring Statement. GBP 32bn),"" Deutsche Bank Chief U.K. Economist Sanjay Raja said.Raja expects spending cuts and tax rises to be divided 60:40 in Hunt's plans, though said these would be done in ""stealth,"" with tax rises concentrated on freezing personal allowances and tax bands, while reducing the additional tax rate threshold from £150,000 to £125,000 in order to generate more income for the Treasury.""Away from 'stealth taxes', we expect to see a couple more options announced onThursday. First, an increase in council tax with local authorities allowed to raise the level of council tax above 3% without a referendum,"" Raja said.""And second, an increase in both the duration and scale of the windfall tax on oil and gas 'excess profits'."" In total, Deutsche projects that the ""fiscal drag"" from stealth taxes and higher windfall taxes will net the Treasury around £35 billion given high inflation and energy prices.Spending cuts, again executed via ""stealth,"" could take the form of ""nominal cash freezes to departmental budgets,"" Raja said, with spending budgets topped up minimally going forward.""Capex plans are also likely to be trimmed over the coming years, and 'efficiency savings' are likely to feature as part of the Chancellor's plans to fill the fiscal hole,"" Raja said.""This will help offset some of the spending rises expected with welfare and pensions payments now likely to be topped up by inflation rather than earnings growth.""Market waits with bated breathThe market roundly rejected September's tax-cutting fiscal announcements from former Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng, with sterling sliding to an all-time low and government bond yields spiking so rapidly that the Bank of England was forced to intervene and prevent the collapse of pension funds.""If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics.""If he tries to minimise the economic pain, he risks unsettling the markets and prompting another surge in gilt yields, which would also worsen the public finances.""Capital Economics expects Hunt to reveal fiscal tightening measures to the tune of £54 billion, around 1.9% of GDP, but for this to be funded primarily by nuanced tax hikes rather than spending cuts, with most policies ""starting later rather than sooner,"" Gregory said."

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday said the Federal Reserve must pay attention to recent retail earnings reports to plan the rest of its battle against inflation.""I am begging the Fed to look at what's happening at individual companies – big ones, not small ones – so that they'll be a little less ruthless going forward,"" he said, adding: ""If they only focus on the macro data from the government, they're going to cause a lot more damage than necessary.""Stocks slumped on Wednesday after Target reported a sales decline, spurred by the weight of high inflation on consumers' pocketbooks heading into the winter holiday season.

2022-11-16,"""Consumer confidence has plunged so badly that the recession will likely not be shallow,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, told CNBC.Preliminary growth estimates for the region suggest a slowdown in the third quarter from the previous-three month period — from 0.8% growth to 0.2%. Belgium, Latvia and Austria registered economic contractions over the last quarter. The euro zone is expected to plunge into recession in the coming months with economists warning ""it will not be shallow.""The 19-member zone that shares the euro currency has been under significant pressure since Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February. A combination of sanctions against the Kremlin, an abrupt end to Russian gas imports, and the need to provide financial support to households and firms struggling with the energy crisis has darkened the outlook for the bloc — which at the start of the year was predicted to grow more rapidly than the United States.""Consumer confidence has plunged so badly that the recession will likely not be shallow,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, told CNBC earlier this month.Data from the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, showed that consumer confidence dropped to a record low in September. It has improved slightly since then, but households still fear for the future and their financial positions. Schmieding said euro zone real (adjusted for inflation) gross domestic product will contract sharply in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year — with a cumulative drop of 1.7%. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. Preliminary growth estimates for the region suggest a slowdown in the third quarter from the previous-three month period — from 0.8% growth to 0.2%. Belgium, Latvia and Austria registered economic contractions over the last quarter.""I wouldn't call it shallow, it will be deeper than certainly what the ECB [European Central Bank] council expects,"" Spyros Andreopoulos, a senior European economist at BNP Paribas, told CNBC earlier this month.The ECB has slowly started to acknowledge the likelihood of a recession in the region. Speaking earlier this month, ECB President Christine Lagarde highlighted that ""the risk of recession has increased.""But annual growth forecasts published by the central bank do not yet envisage an economic contraction across the bloc. They currently point to a GDP rate of 3.1% this year and 0.9% in 2023. Updated figures are due to be published next month. ""I see a risk [the recession] might drag into the second quarter [of 2023],"" Andreopoulos said, citing the energy crisis and monetary policy tightening.There is an obvious risk that temperatures, until now mild for this time of the year, drop significantly at the start of 2023 in mid-winter. In addition, the ECB has raised rates three times this year and it is expected to continue doing so. Aggressive rate increases can stifle economic growth as the price of borrowing increases.Morgan Stanley forecasts an annual contraction of 0.2% in the euro zone for next year, with Germany — traditionally the economic powerhouse of the euro area — facing one of the sharpest declines, at -0.7%.""The natural gas market remains tight and prices should remain elevated. Fiscal support is significant but inflation weighs on corporate profits and households' real incomes, lowering investment and consumption. Monetary policy tightens financial conditions, adding to the slump in capital expenditures,"" analysts at the investment bank said. Even if the euro zone emerges out of recession in the first quarter of next year, economists say the subsequent months will still be hard.""I expect the recovery to be slow,"" Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit, told CNBC Tuesday, citing higher interest rates as one of the main factors in preventing a steeper upturn.When asked if it was going to be an easy year for the euro area, Valli said: ""No, absolutely not."" Felix Hufner, senior European economist at UBS, bac ked up this point, saying if the recession ends in the second quarter, the recovery in 2023 will be a ""weak one ... because the game of storage will start a new.""European leaders have managed to guarantee that natural gas storage is full for this winter, but they will have to source new supplies for next year if they are to stop relying on Russian hydrocarbons — an exercise that's likely to prove costly as global demand grows.It is ""not an exciting forecast,"" Hufner said about the euro zone economic prospects next year.Putting it into context with previous downturns, however, economists say the picture is not as bad as back in the 2008 global financial crisis or, more recently, during the pandemic. The euro zone contracted 4.4% in 2009 and 6.1% in 2020.""The main reason for that is fiscal policy, which provides some offsetting support,"" Andreopoulos said. "
2022-11-16,"Countries should strike up more economic alliances than security and defense ones, as those could make the world ""more dangerous,"" the president of the Center for China and Globalization said on Tuesday.""I hope that the U.S. now has settled this midterm, we can get towards economic, global alliances rather than have a lot of security, military, defense alliances which will make us more and more dangerous,"" Henry Wang said at the SALT iConnections conference in Singapore.Echoing Wang's point, Nicolas Aguzin, CEO of the Hong Kong stock exchange HKEX, said on the same panel that the globalization of trade has created many benefits, including bringing the East and West closer to each other. Countries should strike up more economic alliances than security and defense ones, as those could make the world ""more dangerous,"" the president of the Center for China and Globalization said on Tuesday.Doing that would also circumvent a slide toward deglobalization, which could hold back economic development across the world. The U.S. for example, could consider joining — or ""re-joining"" — the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Henry Wang said at the SALT iConnections conference in Singapore.""The U.S. is the vibe of globalization and [has] always taken the lead on globalization,"" Wang said. ""It was a pity to see the U.S. pulling out of the [Trans-Pacific Partnership, which] ... set higher standards for global trade, including the digital economy, and also the liberalization of trade and facilitation of investments.""Wang added that there should be more economic alliances and fewer security ones such as the AUKUS, Five Eyes and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, an informal strategic alliance. ""I hope that the U.S. now has settled this midterm, we can get towards economic, global alliances rather than have a lot of security, military, defense alliances which will make us more and more dangerous,"" Wang said.The CPTPP was formerly known as the TPP, which was part of the United States' economic and strategic pivot to Asia.Former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the trade pact in 2017, after it drew criticism from the protectionist end of the U.S. political spectrum. The TPP has since evolved into the CPTPP after other members of the pact forged on with it. It is now one of the biggest trade blocs in the world, attracting applicants such as China. The U.S. has not indicated any desire to rejoin the CPTPP. Instead, it launched its own separate non-trade relationship network with Asia-Pacific, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.Echoing Wang's point, Nicolas Aguzin, CEO of the Hong Kong stock exchange HKEX, said on the same panel that the globalization of trade has created many benefits, including bringing the East and West closer to each other.""I mean, it had kept prices very low around the world in a lot of areas; we had productivity,"" he said, adding that he doubts deglobalization would become a reality, in light of the complex interconnectedness of global supply chains.  With new powers emerging, tensions are bound to arise at this juncture of globalization, Aguzin said.""Asia, as a region, over the next 10 years, we represent about half of the output of the world. I mean you're going to have some rocky moments, because it's a big shift. There's a big shift of power and influence from West to East,"" he said. Economic alliances and healthy ""Olympic-style"" competition between the U.S. and China would therefore be better than confrontation, Wang added.Wang said notes from the Chinese Communist Party meeting in Beijing indicate that Chinese policymakers are keen on ""opening up,"" which suggests Beijing still has appetite to promote trade and multilateralism.The appointment of new Cabinet members from developed areas in China, such as Guangdong and Jiangsu, suggests Beijing has its eyes on more development, private businesses and investments from multinational companies, according to Wang."

2022-11-17,"The Federal Reserve's moves in 2022 to aggressively raise interest rates to cool down inflation will inflict greater harm to the economy than expected, according to Barry Sternlicht, chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group.""It's not sustainable,"" he said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Thursday. ""What they want to do is clearly suicide.""The impact of the Fed's rate hikes won't hit right away, he said. Instead, companies will pull back their budgets for 2023 as they worry about economic recession and consumer weakness. That will add pressure to companies and could continue to weigh on stocks.The destruction of wealth that's taking place now, and the movement of capital from investment in new plants and equipment that will grow the economy, is instead going to pull it back, he said.""It's going to slow the economy, it cannot do anything other than that,"" he said.At the same time, geopolitical turmoil is weighing on the U.S. The U.S. Treasury may have to start buying its own assets, doing its own kind of quantitative easing while the Fed is increasing interest rates and trying to slow the economy, he said.""Otherwise, interest rates could get out of hand and you're going to have inflation and you're going to go right over the edge because there's no global growth,"" said Sternlicht, adding that weakness in Europe will further hurt, and even a China reopening won't be a huge catalyst for U.S. companies. That U.S. consumers have also spent down stimulus money from the pandemic just adds to the lack of growth catalysts, according to Sternlicht. He sees debt increasing and moving into a negative spiral.He added that part of the reason that the Fed's rate hikes won't work is that inflation has been spurred by the war in Ukraine, which has roiled oil and agricultural commodity markets, such as wheat.""This is not core inflation and interest rates have nothing to do with it,"" he said.The harm is that killing the global economy will also spill over into other things, like equity markets.""These are people that did solid investing, they weren't stupid,"" he said."

I gave everything I had to build my company.""Her defense team argued she should face a maximum sentence of 18 months, according to court filings. Instead, she was given 135 months, which amounts to 11 years and three months, behind bars.  The Wall Street Journal first broke the story of how Theranos' blood-testing technology was struggling to meet expectations in 2015. Whistleblowers and other witnesses came forth to provide detailed accounts of how Holmes and former operating chief Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani deceived patients, partners, investors and employees about the company's progress and the capabilities of its technology.Once valued at $9 billion by private investors, Theranos shut down in 2018.

Most estimates of the neutral rate are between 1.5% and 2%, suggesting that after an expected December hike  ""accommodation"" will have been removed. The European Central Bank will keep raising interest rates and may even need to restrict economic activity to tame inflation,  ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Friday, singling out rates as the bank's key instrument over balance sheet reduction. The ECB has raised rates by an unprecedented 200 basis points since July to tackle inflation, and said that more policy tightening is coming via rate hikes and the reduction of its 5 trillion euro ($5.2 trillion) debt holding. ""We expect to raise rates further – and withdrawing accommodation may not be enough,"" Lagarde said in a speech at a conference. ""Interest rates are, and will remain, the main tool for adjusting our policy stance,"" she said. ""Acknowledging that interest rates remain the most effective tool for shaping our policy stance, it is appropriate that the balance sheet is normalised in a measured and predictable way.""At 1.5%, the ECB's deposit rate is not far from the so-called neutral rate, where the bank is neither stimulating nor holding back growth. Most estimates of the neutral rate are between 1.5% and 2%, suggesting that after an expected December hike  ""accommodation"" will have been removed.The problem is that inflation, running at 10.6%, is far above the ECB's 2% target and even a recession, now almost certain over the winter months, is unlikely to ease price pressures enough to let the ECB step off the brakes.Investors are now split between pricing a 50 and 75 basis-point hike in December after back-to-back 75 basis point moves, and see the reduction of bond holdings, also known as quantitative tightening, starting in the first half of 2023.The ECB will outline plans for balance sheet reduction in December and the process is expected to start with the bank allowing some, but not all, bonds to expire.""The ECB will ensure that a phase of high inflation does not feed into inflation expectations, allowing too-high inflation to become entrenched,"" Lagarde said."
2022-11-18,"Despite large-scale tech layoffs, the broader labor pool is not in true danger yet, given that staffing levels remained below pre-pandemic levels for some time, a Morgan Stanley research note said.Even with a growth slowdown, the number of tech layoffs is minute compared with the larger employment pool, the research report stated.Executives should expect further attention on operating expenses and hiring levels from investors in the coming quarters, analysts said, and should be scrupulous about expenses. The ranks of tech employees at companies from Asana to Amazon and Meta have been winnowed by massive cuts not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, but in a note Thursday, Morgan Stanley analysts say they don't view these layoffs as a ""harbinger of changes"" for the broader labor pool.The analysts said the large market cap of tech firms and ""idiosyncratic"" hiring in tech relative to the rest of the labor market have resulted in tech layoffs having an outsized impact on perceptions.But as the analysts noted, tech layoffs since December 2021 ""only sum 187,000 ... a sizeable number for the sector [but] barely more than 0.1% of total US payrolls."" Aggressive hiring by tech companies resulted in payrolls at tech and tech-adjacent companies rising ""sharply above [their] pre-pandemic level[s],"" leading the broader market, which until recently lagged 2019 peak employment.Morgan Stanley still anticipates a ""sharp"" drop-off in employment growth, citing slower consumer demand precipitated by higher Federal Reserve rates as a trigger for hiring cutbacks ""across most sectors of the economy.""But the analysts said major job cuts in non-tech industries are unlikely, as ""the [U.S.] economy at large remains short-staffed.""Even if executives may want to trim labor costs, ""there appears to be little fat to cut,"" they wrote.But the perception of cost efficiency and scrupulous hiring practices may be what the market wants to hear, the analysts wrote.

S&P Global Ratings said in July it expects a 30% plunge in sales for 2022, worse than in 2008 when sales fell by about 20%.A slowdown in economic growth, uncertainty about ongoing Covid controls and worries about future income have dampened appetite for buying homes. Adding to those worries are falling prices.Housing prices across 70 cities fell by 1.4% in October from a year ago, according to Goldman Sachs analysis of data released Wednesday.""Despite more local housing easing measures in recent months,"" the analysts said, ""we believe the property markets in lower-tier cities still face strong headwinds from weaker growth fundamentals than large cities, including net population outflows and potential oversupply problems.""The report said housing prices in the largest, tier-1 cities rose by 3.1% in October from September, while Tier-3 cities saw a 3.9% drop during that time.About two years ago, Beijing began to crack down on developers' high reliance on debt for growth. The country's most indebted developer, Evergrande, defaulted late last year in a high-profile debt crisis that rattled investor confidence.Worries about other real estate companies' ability to repay their debt have since spread to once-healthy developers.Trading in shares of Evergrande, Kaisa and Shimao is still suspended.

HSBC names 4 Chinese stocks set to benefit from the trendGoldman thinks the trade right now is on China's economy and gives 2 U.S. stocks to play it While Covid controls have dragged down China's growth this year, the real estate market's struggles have also contributed significantly.The property sector, including related industries, accounts for about a quarter of China's GDP, according to analyst estimates.""I think the real estate sector will become lesser of a drag to the economy in 2023,"" Tommy Wu, senior China economist at Commerzbank AG, said Wednesday.""It is too early to tell whether the measures rolled out so far will be enough to rescue the real estate sector,"" he said. ""But it feels more assuring now because it seems more likely that more forceful measures will be rolled out if the real estate downturn still doesn't turn around meaningful in the coming months."" Ultimately, China's real estate industry is undergoing a state-directed transformation — to a smaller part of the economy and a business model far less reliant on selling apartments before they're completed.The property market has shrunk by roughly one-third compared to last year, and will likely remain the same size next year, S&P's Lu said.State-owned developers have fared better during the downturn, he pointed out.In the first three quarters of the year, Lu said sales by state-owned developers fell by 25%, compared to the 58% sales decline for developers not owned by the state.And despite recent policy moves, Beijing's stance remains firm in dissuading home purchases at scale.Whether it's messaging from the National Bureau of Statistics or the People's Bank of China, official announcements this month reiterated that houses are for living in, not speculation — the mantra that marked the early beginnings of the real estate market slump."
2022-11-22,"U.K. GDP has contracted by 0.4% between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2022, versus 3.7% growth in the OECD area.It is also the only G-7 economy to have shrunk in that time.""We think this is happening mostly because of investment and because of consumption,"" Alvaro Pereira, OECD chief economist, told CNBC. LONDON — U.K. growth has lagged the world's biggest economies since the Covid-19 pandemic and is substantially below the OECD average, according to a new report from the influential Paris-based group.U.K. gross domestic product has contracted by 0.4% between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2022, versus cumulative 3.7% growth in the 38-member Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.In the G-7 nations — which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.S. and U.K. — GDP has grown by a cumulative 2.5%, with only the U.K. recording a decline.""We think this is happening mostly because of investment and because of consumption,"" Alvaro Pereira, the OECD's chief economist, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Tuesday.""Knowing the U.K. faces a difficult fiscal situation, that's why we welcome what the government has done in the latest statement,"" he said.Last week, Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt announced around £30 billion in spending cuts and £25 billion in tax hikes for workers and businesses in what he said was a bid to rebuild public finances, limit 41-year-high inflation and restore economic credibility after the market-rocking September budget.""We think that it is very important to maintain fiscal prudence at the same time that you're able to boost or try to introduce some kinds of reforms to address some of the issues that have been plaguing the United Kingdom for a while, which is very low productivity,"" Pereira continued. ""I think it's time to focus on that as well as monetary and fiscal policy.""Pereira added that the OECD's forecast for the U.K. economy's magnitude of growth between 2022 and 2024 was similar to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, but it expected a shallower 0.4% recession next year followed but 0.2% growth the year after, while the U.K.'s OBR forecasts a deeper recession and a stronger rebound.Former Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders this week told CNBC Hunt's plan had a ""massive"" hole where an economic growth strategy should be. Tuesday also saw the release of the OECD's global Economic Outlook report.This cautioned that the global economy is set to slow in the year ahead due to the energy market shock caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and amid sky-high inflation, low consumer confidence and global risks.However, it believes the world will avoid a recession, with 3.1% growth in 2022, 2.2% growth in 2023 and 2.7% growth in 2024.OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in broadcast remarks the ""world is facing substantial headwinds and substantial risks over the horizon"" and ""countries also need to take bold steps to address some of the longer-term challenges to lay the foundation for a stronger and more resilient economy.""This included structural reforms such as increasing childcare support and flexible working options to encourage more women into the workplace, creating incentives to boost investment in low-emissions technology, and keeping international borders open to trade to alleviate supply-side inflationary pressures.Pereira told CNBC: ""We are facing a very challenging environment. I think one of the most dramatic pictures we have in our outlook is exactly how much countries are spending in terms of energy as a percentage of GDP, and you can see that right now for OECD countries it's close to 18% ... which is as high as we've seen in the oil crisis in the 70s and 80s."" ""We are facing a very large energy shock right now which is lowering growth, at the same time that it's fueling inflation.""The primary downside risks were within energy markets, particularly next year in Europe and Asia if there are two cold winters and retail prices follow wholesale prices higher, he said. The OECD is also concerned about financial market volatility for low-income countries and emerging markets that have high debt burdens amid rising rates.However, he reiterated the OECD did not forecast an annual recession, even in major economies such as the U.S. and the euro zone.He also said central bank action on monetary policy would begin to take effect to tame inflation, and that the latest U.S. inflation print was ""fairly positive.""""We expect that not only the U.S. but other parts of the world, the decisiveness of monetary policy will start to have more and more of an impact. Our central forecast sees inflation peaking in many countries in the mid half of next year or late this year, but mostly next year,"" Pereira said.""Particularly in 2024 we start having inflation rates much closer to target, so there is some light at the end of the tunnel, but we need not to let go of monetary and fiscal tightening working hand in hand."""

2022-11-22,"Candy Valentino remembers times of financial uncertainty. Growing up the daughter of two teenage parents — her father a car mechanic, her mother a housekeeper — money was often scarce, she says.As a teenager, ""I watched my parents work so hard, and I started to think about what it would be like to be the person who owned the building rather than the person who rented it or worked there.""Valentino went on to become a real estate investor and entrepreneur, as well as a guide for those looking to build wealth. Her recent book, ""Wealth Habits,"" offers a guide to achieving financial independence, and she will soon offer a similar online course.But Valentino knows that it's difficult to build wealth if you're on shaky financial footing. If an economic downturn hits, you could find yourself headed in the wrong direction if you're not prepared.""The most important thing we can do so that we can survive any economic downturn, any recession, is to make small decisions up front so that you never get into an issue that you have to worry paying for the things you need,"" she says.Here's what she says you can do now to recession-proof your finances. One of the major dangers of a recession is that companies will be forced to lay off portions of their workforce. To keep the prospect of job loss from derailing your finances, search for multiple ways to bring in regular income, says Valentino.And make sure they're from a diverse array of sources. It's the same logic that applies to building an investment portfolio: By spreading out your bets, you lower the chances that a downturn in any particular type of business can put a major dent in your plans.That may mean finding a side hustle that wouldn't be affected by the same factors as your full-time gig.""Making sure that [your income streams are] not all in a similar or related industry is key so that if one market goes bad — like say, you're heavy in real estate, and real estate market starts to go bad — you have income another way from another type of source,"" Valentino says. As a guideline, Valentino suggests putting at least 20% of your income toward savings and investments.""If you think, 'Oh, my gosh, there's no way I can do that,' that is the No. 1 indicator that tells you that you are living beyond your means,"" says Valentino. ""If you can't save and invest into yourself first, then all of these depreciating assets — the bags, the cars, the fancy shoes — are the physical representation that you're living beyond your means.""Valentino's point is that if you find that you're spending nearly all of your paycheck each month, you're walking a bit of tightrope. Should the economy go south, you could find yourself dipping into debt in order to continue to fund your lifestyle.Of course, you may have trouble saving even if you're not buying shoes and trips to Europe. In those cases, you have two choices, says Valentino: ""You can either decrease your expenses or increase your income to boost that bottom line.""If you're already working hard and your budget is thin, the prospect of boosting your income may feel onerous or unattainable. If that's the case, try thinking outside of the box of what a side hustle can look like, Valentino says.""It's amazing how people can sell knowledge. There are courses on breastfeeding and how to help your child walk earlier,"" she says. ""These are things that most people think, 'Oh, I don't have talents or skills, I can't do something like that.' But anyone that's lived for an amount of time in their life has experience in something.""Want to earn more and work less? Register for the free CNBC Make It: Your Money virtual event on Dec. 13 at 12 p.m. ET to learn from money masters how you can increase your earning power.Don't miss: 75% of young, wealthy Americans get this ‘wrong’ about investing, says CFP"
2022-11-23,"Federal Reserve officials expect to switch to smaller interest rate increases ""soon,"" according to minutes from the November meeting released Wednesday.Some officials expressed concern over the impact rate increases could have on financial stability and the economy.Markets have largely expected the Fed to dial down the intensity of its policy tightening, and the minutes helped confirm that. Federal Reserve officials earlier this month agreed that smaller interest rate increases should happen soon as they evaluate the impact policy is having on the economy, meeting minutes released Wednesday indicated.Reflecting statements that multiple officials have made over the past several weeks, the meeting summary pointed to smaller rate hikes coming. Markets widely expect the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to step down to a 0.5 percentage point increase in December, following four straight 0.75 percentage point hikes.Though hinting that less severe moves were ahead, officials said they still see few signs of inflation abating. However, some committee members expressed concern about risks to the financial system should the Fed continue to press forward at the same aggressive pace.""A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,"" the minutes stated. ""The uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assessment was important.""The minutes noted that the smaller hikes would give policymakers a chance to evaluate the impact of the succession of rate hikes. The central bank's next interest rate decision is Dec. 14.The summary noted that a few members indicated that ""slowing the pace of increase could reduce the risk of instability in the financial system."" Others said they'd like to wait to ease up on the pace. Officials said they see the balance of risks on the economy now skewed to the downside. related investing newsThe Fed could enact a 'substitute' interest rate hike at its June meetingJeff Cox18 hours agoMarkets had been looking for clues about not only what the next rate hike might look like but also for how far policymakers think they'll have to go next year to make satisfactory progress against inflation.Officials at the meeting said it was just as important for the public to focus more on how far the Fed will go with rates rather ""than the pace of further increases in the target range.""The minutes noted that the ultimate rate is probably higher than officials had previously thought. At the September meeting, committee members had penciled in a terminal funds rate around 4.6%; recent statements have indicated the level could exceed 5%.

JPMorgan's massively popular income ETF is getting beat by its own sister fundBank of America analysts are bullish on these top 10 unloved global stocksBitcoin just posted its worst week of the year. Here's where analysts see it heading next. Over the past few weeks, officials have spoken largely in unison about the need to keep up the inflation fight, while also indicating they can pull back on the level of rate hikes. That means a strong likelihood of a 0.5 percentage point increase in December, but still an uncertain course after that.Markets expect a few more rate hikes in 2023, taking the funds rate to around 5%, and then possibly some reductions before next year ends.The post-meeting statement from the FOMC added a sentence that markets interpreted as a signal that the Fed will be doing smaller increases ahead. That sentence read, ""In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.""Investors saw it as a nod to a reduced intensity of hikes following four straight 0.75 percentage point increases that took the Fed's benchmark overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, the highest in 14 years. Several Fed officials have said in recent days that they anticipate a likely half-point move in December.""They're getting to a point where they don't have to move so quickly. That's helpful since they don't know exactly how much tightening they're going to have to do,"" said Bill English, a former Fed official now with the Yale School of Management. ""They emphasize policy works with lags, so it's helpful to be able to go a little bit more slowly.""Inflation data lately has been showing some encouraging signs while remaining well above the central bank's 2% official target.The consumer price index in October was up 7.7% from a year ago, the lowest reading since January. However, a measure the Fed follows more closely, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, showed a 5.1% annual rise in September, up 0.2 percentage points from August and the highest reading since March.Those reports came out after the November Fed meeting. Several officials said they viewed the reports positively but will need to see more before they consider easing up on policy tightening.The Fed has been the target lately of some criticism that it could be tightening too much. The worry is that policymakers are too focused on backward-looking data and missing signs that inflation is ebbing and growth is slowing.However, English expects the Fed officials to keep their collective foot on the brake until there are clearer signals that prices are falling. He added that the Fed is willing to risk a slowing economy as it pursues its goal.""They have risks in both directions, if doing too little and doing too much. They've been fairly clear that they view the risks of inflation getting out of the box and the need to do a really big tightening as the biggest risk,"" he said. ""It's a hard time to be [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell."""
2022-11-23,"The main opposition Labour party on Tuesday ruled out a return to the EU's single market or customs union if it wins the next general election.The OECD forecast on Tuesday that only Russia would suffer a bigger economic contraction than the U.K. in 2023 among the G-20 leading developed and developing economies.A frequent YouGov survey earlier this month showed that 56% of the population said Britain was ""wrong"" to vote to leave the EU in 2016, compared to 32% who said it was the right call. LONDON — As evidence mounts of the long-term harm being inflicted on the U.K. economy by Brexit, the government is coming under pressure to acknowledge the elephant in the room.Despite criticizing the Conservative government's fiscal plans as the U.K. economy faces a recession and the sharpest fall in living standards since records began, the country's main opposition Labour party on Tuesday ruled out a return to the EU's single market or customs union if it wins the next general election — due no later than January 2025.Labour leader Keir Starmer told a business conference that the party would instead ""make Brexit work,"" but economists have suggested that either or both of these measures would help to cushion the blow to the country's long-term economic growth prospects.The government has avoided addressing the impact of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, with ministers attributing the country's economic headwinds solely to the energy crisis arising from Russia's war in Ukraine, and lingering effects from the Covid-19 pandemic.However, the OECD forecast on Tuesday that only Russia would suffer a bigger economic contraction than the U.K. in 2023 among the G-20 (Group of Twenty) leading developed and developing economies. The 0.2% expansion projected in 2024 is the joint-weakest alongside Russia. The U.K.'s growth prospects are lower even than Germany, whose economy is uniquely exposed to higher energy prices owing to its reliance on Russian gas imports. The OECD said ""lingering uncertainty"" alongside higher costs of capital would continue to weigh on business investment in the U.K., which has fallen sharply since Brexit.The U.K.'s independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has offered a bleaker outlook, projecting a 1.4% GDP contraction in 2023, even as the Bank of England and the government are forced to tighten monetary and fiscal policy to contain inflation and prevent the economy overheating.The OBR said in its economic and fiscal outlook last week that its trade forecast reflected an assumption that Brexit would result in the U.K.'s trade intensity (an economy's integration with the world economy) being 15% lower in the long run than if the country had remained in the EU.Trade intensity plungingIn May, the OBR estimated that the U.K.'s new terms of trade with the EU, set out in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) that came into effect on Jan. 1, 2021, will reduce long-run productivity by 4% relative to the previous trajectory had the U.K. remained in the EU.The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee issued a similar projection, and former BOE policymaker Michael Saunders told CNBC Monday that a key driver of weakness in the U.K. economy is reduced trade intensity due to Brexit, leading to lower productivity growth.Saunders argued that there is ""abundant evidence"" that increased trade intensity — or greater openness to trade on both exports and imports — raises productivity growth.""The U.K. has increased trade barriers with Europe and trade deals that have been done with other countries are largely just maintaining the status quo of trade with third countries — there's been no significant net increase in trade intensity with non-EU countries,"" he said. ""So the overall net effect has been a significant reduction in the U.K.'s trade intensity, which you can see in the big drop in both imports and exports as a share of GDP since 2019 compared to the trends in other advanced economies and compared to the trends that we saw in the preceding years.""U.K. trade as a percentage of GDP has fallen from around 63% in 2019 to around 55% in 2021, while domestic productivity growth is also sluggish. Both the Bank of England and the OBR estimate that the U.K.'s potential output has fallen outright since the fourth quarter of 2019, and will endure anemic growth through the next few years.New York-based Kroll Bond Rating Agency downgraded the U.K. even before former Prime Minister Liz Truss' disastrous mini-budget in September sent bond markets into a tailspin.Ken Egan, director of European sovereign credit at KBRA, told CNBC last week that Brexit marked a ""turning point"" for the U.K. as it gave rise to several structural weaknesses in the economy. ""Part of the reason for our downgrade was a longer term view that Brexit has had and will continue to have a negative impact on the U.K. from a credit perspective, in terms of everything from trade to government finances to the macroeconomic side of things.""KBRA, like the OBR, Bank of England, International Monetary Fund, OECD and majority of economists, believes growth will be lower over the medium term as a result of Brexit.""Trade has already suffered, the currency has weakened but we haven't seen the offsetting improvement of trade, investment has really been the weak point since Brexit, business investment has really deteriorated quite sharply,"" Egan explained.""If you compare inflation in the current dynamic to the rest of the world, core services, core goods inflation in the U.K. seems to be a lot higher than the rest of Europe. It's that idea that even if the energy crisis was over tomorrow, you'd still have these stickier inflation pressures in the U.K.""Public mood shiftingSaunders said that while part of the deterioration since the fourth quarter of 2019 was down to the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit also had a part to play as increased trade barriers with the EU for firms since the start of 2021 stymied activity.""If you don't want to reverse Brexit fully, you can still go for a softer Brexit than the U.K. chose to do,"" he suggested.""The U.K. went for pretty much the hardest of hard Brexits and that was a choice, we could have left the EU but gone for a form of Brexit which would have put many fewer barriers in the way of trade, trade intensity would have suffered less, productivity would suffer less over time."" New Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government is expected to pursue friendlier relations with the EU than either of his predecessors, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. However, both the Conservatives and Labour have ruled out any return to EU-aligned institutions for fear of disenfranchising voters in key pro-Brexit constituencies.Yet recent polling suggests that the public mood may have begun to turn. A frequent YouGov survey earlier this month showed that 56% of the population said Britain was ""wrong"" to vote to leave the EU in 2016, compared to 32% who said it was the right call.The 24-point deficit was the largest in the series dating back to 2016, and almost one-fifth of Leave voters now believed Brexit was the wrong decision, which was also a record."
2022-11-23,"In the last few days, the mainland China daily Covid case count has climbed to around or more than 28,000 — near levels seen in April during a stringent lockdown in Shanghai, according to CNBC calculations of Wind Information data.“China might have already passed the point of no return, as it's unlikely to achieve zero Covid again without another Shanghai-style hard lockdown,"" Macquarie's Chief China Economist Larry Hu said in a report Tuesday.In GDP terms, nearly 20% of China's economy was negatively affected by Covid controls as of Monday, close to the high of 21.2% recorded in mid-April during Shanghai's lockdown, Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu said, citing the firm's model. BEIJING — Surging Covid infections across mainland China make it harder for the government to achieve zero-Covid without reverting to a harsh lockdown, Macquarie's Chief China Economist Larry Hu said.In the last few days, the daily case count has climbed to around or more than 28,000 — near levels seen in April during a stringent lockdown in Shanghai, according to CNBC calculations of Wind Information data. The figures showed the last time mainland China saw only a handful of daily infections was in June, shortly after Shanghai eased its restrictions.The latest Covid wave has hit the southern city of Guangzhou, the capital city of Beijing and many central parts of China — prompting local officials to tighten restrictions on business and social activity this month. “China might have already passed the point of no return, as it's unlikely to achieve zero Covid again without another Shanghai-style hard lockdown,"" Hu said in a report Tuesday. ""What policymakers could do now is to slow the spread of virus, i.e. flatten the curve, by tightening the Covid controls for the time being.""Hu pointed to slight changes this month in government policy and propaganda as signs authorities are preparing for reopening in the next six to nine months. But he noted that ""the road to reopening is set to involve lots of back-and-forth.""Markets have speculated for weeks about the timing of China's departure from its stringent zero-Covid policy. The controls have weighed on the economy, which barely eked out growth while Shanghai was locked down and has posted growth of only 3% during the first three quarters of the year. In GDP terms, nearly 20% of China's economy was negatively affected by Covid controls as of Monday, close to the high of 21.2% recorded in mid-April during Shanghai's lockdown, Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu said, citing the firm's model.""Beijing has recently shown early signs of willingness to reopen, and it has rolled out some fine-tuning measures, but the reopening may be a prolonged process with discomfort,"" Lu said in a separate report this week.He said Vietnam's unwinding of its Covid restrictions since fall last year could shed light on the path forward for China. He noted how the Southeast Asian country saw ""no immediate surge in infections after the pivot,"" while its GDP rebounded. Local authorities in China have faced the difficult task of trying to make Covid measures more targeted, while controlling infections.As of Monday, about 412 million people were affected by lockdown measures in mainland China, according to Nomura estimates. That's up from 340 million the prior week, the report said. The Nomura analysts noted that many lockdowns or controls are implemented without public announcement.

Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden backed more interest rate hikes on Thursday, but said he would consider cutting rates if the economy and inflation pressures panned out differently to his expectation.Ramsden is the latest member of the Monetary Policy Committee to mention the possibility of cutting interest rates at some point, after the BoE earlier this month said market expectations for interest north of 5% were too high.related investing newsMarkets next week may keep thinking about what could go rightScott Schnipper18 hours ago""Although my bias is towards further tightening, if the economy develops differently to my expectation and persistence in inflation stops being a concern, then I would consider the case for reducing Bank Rate, as appropriate,"" Ramsden said in a speech at King's College London.But Ramsden also said he would ""continue to vote to respond forcefully"" if inflation pressures proved to be more persistent than expected.He described his approach to setting policy as ""watchful and responsive."" Earlier this month, MPC member Silvana Tenreyro said she saw rates on hold this year and then falling in 2024, while another, Swathi Dhingra, has warned that an over-tightening of policy could stoke a deep recession.A Reuters poll published on Wednesday showed a majority of economists thought the BoE will raise rates again next month to 3.5% from 3.0%, although almost a quarter of them said a bigger rate hike to 3.75% was likely.The BoE has raised interest rates eight times since December 2021. Ramsden said the government's budget statement published earlier this month – comprising tax rises and spending restraint– was likely to push down on economic growth and inflation.""However, the vast majority of these measures do not come into effect until April 2025 so will have very little effect over the MPC's three-year forecast horizon, relative to what was assumed in the November MPC,"" Ramsden said. Ramsden said he was ""acutely conscious"" that the BoE was adding to households' difficulties – but added that the MPC had to take the necessary steps to return inflation to the BoE's 2% target.Ramsden also added that Britain's international reputation had not yet fully recovered from the financial turmoil unleashed by former finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng's Sept. 23 mini-budget, despite a fall in borrowing costs."

Southeast Asian tech giants Grab and Gojek said they are ""supportive"" of recommendations made by an advisory committee to expand gig worker protection in Singapore starting in 2024.In Singapore, platform or gig workers, often ride-hailing or food delivery drivers, have thus far been considered self-employed.

Here's what that could mean for its stockMichelle Foxa day agoAs of 2020, the city-state's Ministry of Manpower estimated that such workers made up about 3% of the resident workforce, or 79,000 people.While the recommendations, accepted by the government Wednesday, said these workers should not be classified as employees, they stipulated platforms that exert a significant level of management control over gig workers must provide them with certain basic protections including CPF contributions and injury compensation starting in 2024.Under the CPF measure, both platform workers and platform companies such as Grab, Gojek, Foodpanda and Deliveroo will need to make contributions at the same rate as employees and employers. This applies if the worker is younger than 30-years-old in the first year of implementation, while it is on a voluntary basis for those aged 30 and above.

A Grab spokesperson said current macroeconomic conditions such as inflation ""coupled with the potential high operational and implementation costs"" requires gradual implementation of the recommendations.The spokesperson also said that with the challenge of being one of the first platforms to implement work injury compensation and income loss insurance, it would ""require a trial of the concept involving a smaller group of workers across platforms.""""We will be guided by these considerations to ensure minimum impact on our partners' earnings and consumer prices,"" the Grab spokesperson said in emailed comments. Gojek told CNBC that they, too, are ""supportive"" of this review and said the recommendations will build on their existing driver benefits program.""Practically however, CPF contributions will mean less take-home earnings for our driver-partners.

Gojek also cited rising costs being one of the challenges.Grab said the measures should be applied to all industry players for the sake of fairness.""Grab is of the view that street-hail taxi and third-party logistics companies should also be covered under the set of recommendations as they similarly tap on gig workers with the same workplace protection needs for their business requirements,"" the Grab spokesperson said.""Excluding them will result in an unlevel playing field and may lead to price and market distortion.

2022-11-24,"Claudia Buch, vice president of the Bundesbank, told CNBC there had not been a reversal of the ""overall dynamic"" in the housing market so there would still be overvaluations.German homeowners are less vulnerable to interest rate rises than some elsewhere due to the high proportion of fixed-rate mortgages.The central bank's Financial Stability Review for 2022 says the German economy is at a ""turning point"" following price corrections in financial markets. Germany's central bank is predicting a slowdown but no significant correction in the country's property market despite warnings of overvaluation, according to a report published Thursday.Claudia Buch, vice president of the Bundesbank, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche: ""We do see a slowdown in the price growth for residential real estate, but it's not that the overall dynamic has reversed.""""So we still have overvaluations in the market,"" she said.The report notes the strong rise in German residential property prices from 2010 to mid-2022 and says overvaluations in the market have increased, ranging between 15% and 40% in both German cities and towns and the country as a whole in 2021.Some analysts, including at Deutsche Bank, have forecast a sharp decline for the sector. House prices have already declined around 5% since March, according to Deutsche Bank data, and they will drop between 20% and 25% in total from peak to trough, forecasts Jochen Moebert, a macroeconomic analyst at the German lender.Buch said the central bank's concern was the extent to which overvaluation was being driven by the loosening of credit standards by a very fast growth in credit residential mortgages.""There we also see a slowdown,"" she said. ""So we don't currently think that additional measures are taken to slow down the build-up of vulnerabilities in this market segment, but we do think we need to keep monitoring the market because we know that private households are very much exposed to mortgage loans, so that's the biggest component in private household debt.""The German market has a high share of fixed-rate mortgages so households are less vulnerable to rising interest rates than in some other countries, she continued.""Of course the risk doesn't disappear, it's still in the system, but this exposure to interest rate risk is largely with the financial sector, the banks who've done that lending with regard to mortgages.""The Bundesbank's Financial Stability Review for 2022 highlights other issues, including deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and the slowdown in German economic activity, increases in energy prices and the fall in real disposable income.It describes the German economy as at a ""turning point"" following price corrections in financial markets, which have led to write-downs on securities portfolios. It also cites increased collateral requirements in futures markets and increased risks from corporate loans.It says there has been no fundamental reassessment of credit risk in German banks so far but says its financial system is ""vulnerable to adverse developments.""""The message is very clear, we need a resilient financial system, we need to keep building up resilience over the next period of time,"" Buch told CNBC.Additional reporting by Hannah Ward-Glenton"
2022-11-25,"If inflation has peaked, employers will begin to contemplate lower annual pay raises, but are not likely to take action next year to reduce pay to any significant degree.Last year's merit bumps in salaries were outsize compared to recent history.But so far the data shows that most companies do not think 2023 will be the year to bring raises back down to the standard 3.5%. Inflation and annual pay are not in a one-to-one relationship. That became clear to many workers last year when their annual merit increases in salary and wages were not anywhere near the four-decade highs for inflation. Many employees griped, even as pay was increased by more than what had been the normal for decades, and wondered why their pay wasn't pegged to the Consumer Price Index that reached over 9% earlier this year. Workers had a point: real wages weren't keeping up with the prices that consumers were paying for everything from groceries to gas and housing.But most companies never have, and never will, set pay to match inflation exactly. Once you pay people more, it's hard to claw that back even when inflation starts to come back down. Employers did pay workers a lot more last year, with the average raise running near two percentage points higher, at 4.8%, than the standard 3% merit increase most often awarded in recent decades, according to data from compensation consultant Pearl Meyer earlier this year.As inflation has dipped and there has been more conviction that the peak in higher prices is in for the U.S. economy, C-suites have begun to at least ask the question: When will it be okay for standard cost of-living adjustment-linked pay raises to go back down again? We've heard that from members of the CNBC CFO Council, but their answer to the question has so far been that the labor market is still too tight, and it's not going to be in 2023 that bosses get back to ""normal"" in setting raises.Downward pressure on raises, but still tight labor marketThe latest data from Pearl Meyer looking at companies across all sectors of the economy also indicates that 2023 won't be the back-to-three-percent year, though there is evidence of downward pressure in the absolute amount of pay increase.""There's still this sense across industries that wage inflation is strong, there is still strong demand for talent,"" said Bill Reilly, managing director at Pearl Meyer. The Pearl Meyer survey was conducted in August and September before the layoffs started to mount at the tech sector's largest companies, including Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and HP, and companies can still adjust their plans in the months ahead based on economic conditions, which has workers worried, including at Alphabet's Google. But Reilly said that to date, the numbers are ""solidly at 4%"" for both executive and rank-and-file pay increases. Some companies in sectors where demand is still high and labor supply is still tight, life sciences as an example, are looking at annual pay increases as high as 5%, he said. Private companies, on average, expect to pay more than publicly traded ones, but the 4% figure represents the median increase across the Pearl Meyer survey of a representative sample of employers throughout the economy.Peak pay?The data does indicate that the peak could be in for the level of pay raises at many companies. In 2022, the compensation firm found that total increases were over 4% for two-thirds of survey participants as compared to this year's median, or 50th percentile, at 4%. And the pay increase was over 6% for a quarter of organizations. This year, that 75th percentile is at 5%. In 2022, not only was the median closer to 5%, but many companies made mid-year adjustments as to pay with inflation reaching over 9% in June. One-fifth of companies made ""off-cycle"" salary adjustments this year.This year, that could be less likely. However, when Pearl Meyer asked the compensation decision makers in its survey to rank challenges they face in 2023, wage inflation and a tight labor market were still at the top of the list alongside concerns about a more challenging economic climate overall. ""For many companies, it's still really a seller's market as it relates to employees and employment opportunities and preferences,"" Reilly said. ""Slightly down, but still above the historical norm,"" he said of the overall salary survey conclusions.""Many companies are still actively recruiting and know the employee mindset has changed, particularly for younger folks,"" Reilly said.That applies to more than just wages, and right now, work-from-home flexibility is one example.Seventy-five percent of companies in the survey have some form of hybrid work and one expense that is not being planned for next year, according to Pearl Meyer: any money on office perks and enticements to bring more workers back to company locations.The Fed, inflation and a slowing economyThe actual pay increase levels may still change, just like this year, when the raises end up being higher than companies initially forecast. Next year could be the reverse of that, starting with a strong labor market and employee retention front and center as a consideration, but the macroeconomic challenges growing and leading companies to lower their salary budgets. Some industries will struggle more than others or be overly cautious due to the economic outlook and roll back their merit increase forecast, Reilly said. But he added, ""more are likely to be as generous as they can on a broad-based level.""One CNBC CFO Council member recently told us that big risk in the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases is that the labor market is a lagging indicator, looking strong for much of the initial period of rate hikes, but then the layoffs mount throughout the economy too quickly for the central bank to adjust its policy. In spite of this C-suite fear, the data indicates that even amid all the talk of recession and layoffs, 99% of Pearl Meyer survey respondents said they are planning merit increases for 2023 for broad-based employee pools. ""The point is that most were not signaling salary freezes, and 4% was a solid number, and seems to align with other external data, and we're pretty confident on that 4% as the market number,"" Reilly said.How long will the higher raises last? Could the standard 3% annual increase be a permanent thing of the past? The Fed's policy shift is designed to bring inflation back to its target of 2% and on the way there, force higher unemployment as part of that economic tightening. But the Fed is also facing some new pressure from the market to accept that the 2% target is outdated and unhelpful to the economy.In a CNBC appearance last Thursday, Barry Sternlicht, the head of Starwood Capital, which manages $125 billion for clients, called into question the 2% target as part of ongoing criticism he has leveled at the central bank. ""It will be very hard to get it to 2 [percent] and it's not necessary,"" he said.Even though inflation and pay raises are not in a one-to-one relationship, there is certainly a link.Pearl Meyer research indicates that merit increases are a lagging indicator relative to inflation and costs. As inflation moderates over time, as the Fed's actions work their way through the economy, wherever it settles that should translate to a tempering of the merit increases. ""But I couldn't tell you whether it's 2024 or 2025, another year or two above average,"" Reilly said.And as for back to 3% or 3.5%, ""It's not next year,"" said one CNBC CFO Council member in a recent interview. And that was a CFO from the tech sector. "
2022-11-25,"  Black Friday remains the most popular holiday sales event for Americans, and while inflation is a top concern, consumers are not saying they will cut back sharply on spending, according to an annual shopping poll conducted by CNBC and SurveyMonkey.More in-person shopping is slowing pandemic gains made by e-commerce.A strong consumer is not translating into a big win for Main Street, as Small Business Saturday remains a distant third behind Black Friday and Cyber Monday among shoppers. Americans are not planning major cuts in holiday spending this year, starting with Black Friday, despite inflation fears and the risk of recession being top concerns among the majority of consumers, according to an annual survey conducted by CNBC and SurveyMonkey ahead of the first big shopping weekend of peak season.Two-thirds of Americans (67%) are worried about inflation making it more difficult for them to buy the items they want. Even more (69%) worry a recession will limit their ability to make purchases. But anticipated cutbacks in spending among consumers are only up slightly compared to last year — 39% versus 36% — with the majority of Americans saying they expect to spend the same (44%) or more (14%) this year, according to the annual CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Saturday poll.""People are pretty consistent on how much they expect to spend on holiday shopping,"" said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at Momentive. ""Things are going to cost more and you have to accept that there is not some secret way to get around that high inflation,"" she said. But she cautioned that there's still the risk that consumer behavior changes once shoppers evaluate prices. ""The intent may be different than the outcome. They will see some sticker shock out there and find their budget won't go as far as previous years,"" Wronski said.The survey results reveal the consumer divide in the economy, with spending concerns more prevalent at lower income levels.Seventy-eight percent of households earning less than $50,000 are concerned about their spending power amid inflation this holiday season, a figure which drops to 56% for household incomes of $100,000 or more.Economic concerns are relatively high among younger Americans as well, with 73% of those 18-34 worried about being able to buy what they want due to inflation, the highest among any age group in the survey.The data on inflation matches concerns in last year's survey regarding a supply chain which at that time was broken.""Inflation is playing that role of the supply chain saga this year,"" Wronski said.The SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted November 9-13, 2022 among a national sample of 3,549 adults. The National Retail Federation forecast released earlier this week predicted record sales for the first holiday shopping weekend, beginning on Black Friday, expecting eight million more shoppers (166 million) this year over last year, and the highest level since 2017.Some recent earnings reports from retailers demonstrate the resilient consumer. Best Buy reported third quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and said it expects holiday spending to look more similar to historical holiday periods, with customer shopping activity concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday and the two weeks leading up to December 25. Abercrombie & Fitch said this week it's ""cautiously optimistic"" about holiday sales.But the concerns about younger consumers have also been displayed in recent retail sales reports. Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne said on its earnings call earlier this week that the company raised prices ""more than we should have"" at its stores — it has a younger consumer base that is more impacted by inflation. American Eagle Outfitters' CEO said on its earnings call to expect, ""a highly promotional holiday season.""Retailers are expected to offer some pretty big discounts to move inventory, starting with Black Friday. ""Both inflation and recession are tied together and both top of mind for consumers, but habits are sticky,"" Wronski said. ""This is the time of year you are expected to make purchases and spend more than you should. ... That's the main takeaway. They aren't making big changes despite the fact that they have recession concerns and we are in a high inflation environment.""The CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll finds that with many consumer spending habits in line with the past, sharp changes in shopping patterns caused by the pandemic, such as e-commerce versus in-store, are settling into a new normal.Here are a few more of the key findings from this year's survey.Black Friday is still the No. 1 shopping holidayThe survey has consistently found that the hype around shopping holidays is often higher than the actual excitement among consumers. More than half (55%) of survey respondents don't plan to go shopping on Black Friday, Small Business Saturday or Cyber Monday. Last year, that figure was at 52%.But Black Friday remains the No. 1 shopping holiday that Americans say they will spend on. One in five (21%) are ""most excited"" to go shopping on Black Friday, almost double the consumers planning to shop on Cyber Monday (12%). Small Business Saturday is a distant third, at 7%.For small businesses, the concept of a holiday shopping day is more difficult to convey as there are so many different kinds of businesses that fit under the Main Street umbrella, Wronski noted, from the local bookstore to restaurants and many other types of retail, and there is also less coordination of discounts possible compared to the likes of big box retailers. There has been a steep decline over the past four years in holiday shoppers who plan to patronize a small business on Small Business Saturday, down from 44% in 2018 to 28% this year. Amazon and Small Business Saturday spendingThe gains made by e-commerce may have contributed to a permanent decline in Small Business Saturday shopping interest, which is at a four-year low. But it's also contributed to more small business purchases being made online, with the percentage of Americans planning to buy online from a small business this year doubling over the past four years, from 9% to 18%, while those who say they will patronize a small business in-person has fallen by 10% (from 58% vs. 48%). During the peak pandemic year of 2020, one-fifth (20%) of consumers planning to spend on Small Business Saturday said they would make purchases online, with this year's results indicating permanent gains for Main Street e-commerce.A correlation between the Amazon threat and Main Street's struggles, meanwhile, is not in evidence in the survey results. Two-thirds of American adults (66%) say they have Amazon Prime subscriptions, virtually unchanged from last year, but they are much more likely to say they will spend on Small Business Saturday (33%). That's nearly double the number of consumers who don't subscribe to Amazon Prime (18%) and plan to shop on Small Business Saturday.""We always hear about the Amazon threat but we never seen it play out that way,"" Wronski said. ""It shows up in some data in other ways, and Amazon is taking business away, but at same time people buying from Amazon are also buying from small businesses at higher rates,"" she said, adding that one factor is a correlation between an Amazon Prime subscription and higher wealth levels.E-commerce gains have slowed but are here to stayThis year has been a tough one for technology companies that bet the acceleration of gains made during the pandemic would continue with the behavior of Americans vastly changed. That's not the case, but gains made by e-commerce do look to be settling into a permanent state.More than half of shoppers (51%) say they prefer to do holiday shopping in-person, compared to those who prefer to shop online (47%). Those figures are unchanged from last year, but they do mark a significant shift from pre-pandemic years, according to SurveyMonkey. In 2018, 61% of holiday shoppers said they preferred to buy in-person, while 37% said they preferred to buy online. Online shoppers already spent a record amount on Thanksgiving Day."

While still at 14-year highs, Singapore's core consumer price index rose 5.1% for the month compared with a year ago, slightly lower than 5.3% in September.  Singapore does not have an explicit inflation target, but MAS sees a core inflation rate of 2% as generally reflective of ""overall price stability."" The country's October core CPI is also significantly above that level as well as the central bank's forecast for ""around 4%"" inflation for 2022.JPMorgan analysts said while they expect core inflation levels to remain elevated until the first quarter of next year, they predict the readings that follow will show more easing. That would leave room for the central bank to step away from a hawkish stance.""If this forecast materializes, this would suggest little need for the MAS to tighten its NEER policy next year,"" the firm said in a note. Minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting released this week said that smaller interest rate hikes should happen ""soon"" — an indication that its global peers, including the MAS, could also take a breather from their own tightening cycles.""MAS is in a similar position too — it has tightened monetary policy a lot in 2022 and will want to see how the impact plays out,"" said BofA Securities ASEAN economist Mohamed Faiz Nagutha.""This means further tightening is not a given, but also cannot be ruled out at this juncture,"" he said.

However, Green argued that the hit from lockdowns, particularly to consumer confidence, service sector jobs and wage growth, was so substantial that the PBOC's monetary policy moves are ""effectively pushing on a string.""""They're actually very loose already, certainly relative to demand, so these rate cuts will help a bit at the margin — the measures to support the property developers do substantially lower the tail risk of a disorderly exit for some of these developers — but in terms of re-accelerating the economy, it's really a Covid and a consumer story and that's not going to come until Q2 of next year,"" he added.Supply chain disruptionsThese comments were echoed by Swiss lender UBS, which said in a note Monday that rising Covid-19 infections would remain a significant drag on growth.""It will take more time to understand the impact of the reported public opposition to Covid curbsand the official response, but the latest developments add to uncertainty for offshore investors and may weigh on sentiment,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. UBS does not yet see this impacting its base case for a full reopening around the third quarter of 2023.Haefele noted that a widening of infections could exacerbate global supply chain interruptions and cause domestic headwinds to spill into global markets. Thus far, supply chains have been less severely affected than during April's outbreak as the wave has not extended to China's major ports or manufacturing hubs, but iPhone assembler Foxconn has faced large protests from workers over the past week over working and living conditions.Haefele noted that this is likely to result in a 30% reduction in Foxconn shipments in November, with risks remaining that broader supply chain pressures could rise, potentially affecting exports of machinery and household appliances.""So, we do not expect economic or market headwinds in China to abate significantly over the coming months. Policy support remains focused on stabilizing the economy, rather than spurring growth, in our view,"" Haefele said, adding that the mounting social discontent ""adds to execution and implementation risks"" for Beijing.As a result, we remain neutral on Chinese equities. We also view China's sluggish recovery as a risk for the global economy and markets,"" Haefele said.""Against this backdrop, we advise investors to focus on defensive assets in both equity and fixed income markets."""
2022-11-28,"The eruption over the weekend of mass protests in China could mark the start of a ""more authoritarian"" era in President Xi Jinping's premiership, one analyst cautioned.The protests present one of the most outward rejections of Beijing in decades and a clear affront to Xi's zero-Covid policy.""It raises the pressure on Xi Jinping, and I think likely puts him towards a more authoritarian approach to governance in China,"" TS Lombard's chief China economist told CNBC Monday. The eruption over the weekend of protests in China could mark the start of a ""more authoritarian"" era in President Xi Jinping's rule, one analyst warned Monday, as Beijing appeared to reach a critical crossroads in its zero-Covid strategy.Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of major cities on Saturday and Sunday to demonstrate against China's stringent Covid-19 measures, which have seen lockdowns, mass testing and widespread restrictions persist almost three years since the onset of the pandemic.The protests present one of the most outward rejections of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) authority in decades, and a clear affront to Xi's signature ""zero-Covid"" policy, TS Lombard's chief China economist told CNBC Monday. ""They are widespread and, crucially, [they are] the first protests in a very long time that are going against a central government policy — and one that is very closely associated with Xi Jinping. So they are incredibly significant,"" Rory Green told CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe."" While Green said it was important not to ""over extrapolate"" the weekend's events, he added that it could pile the pressure on the Chinese leader to clamp down on dissent.""It raises the pressure on Xi Jinping, and I think likely puts him towards a more authoritarian approach to governance in China,"" Green added. The unrest — which included open calls in Shanghai for Xi to step down and the detention of foreign journalists — has been well-documented in the international press. But coverage within China has been somewhat limited due to the government's stringent censorship rules and control of the media.As such, Xi's CCP could clamp down further on public protests, Green noted. That was the case during 2019's pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and 1989's Tiananmen Square protests on the Chinese mainland. The party is also likely to continue pursuing a hard line in its Covid strategy, as cases hit record highs even as citizens had anticipated an easing of measures.""In the short term, the Covid policy will only be fine-tuned without moving the needle,"" Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL, said Monday.""The focus of narratives is expected to be shifting back and forth between eliminating cases and making more precise measures,"" he added. That will add downward pressure to the country's already struggling economy. As of the third quarter, China's growth for the year was just 3%, well below the official target of around 5.5%.TS Lombard's Green said he thinks it is unlikely that real GDP growth will surpass 1% over the coming six months, as the county struggles to emerge from its ""Covid coma.""""The upshot for the economy is bleak. We think China stays in this Covid coma until at least Q2 2023,"" he said."
2022-11-29,"Mainland China reported the first decline in daily Covid infections in more than a week on Monday.There was no indication of new protests, after public demonstrations over the weekend.Stringent Covid controls this year have weighed heavily on business activity and economic growth in China. BEIJING — Mainland China reported the first decline in daily Covid infections in more than a week on Monday.The country said local infections, mostly asymptomatic, totaled 38,421, down from a record high of 40,052 reported for Sunday, according to CNBC calculations of Wind Information data.The last time the daily case count fell from the prior day was on Nov. 19, the data showed.Local infections fell in Guangdong and Chongqing, two of the hardest-hit regions in the latest Covid wave. No new deaths were reported.But the capital city of Beijing saw infections rise Monday from a day earlier, as did Shanghai, albeit at a far smaller scale. Shanghai Disneyland said it would suspend operations from Tuesday, after briefly reopening Friday. The Universal Beijing Resort remains open.There was no indication of new protests on Monday. Over the weekend, students and groups of people across China held public demonstrations to protest the country's stringent zero-Covid policy. Security has tightened in areas where protesters had gathered in Beijing and Shanghai, according to social media. Some social media reports said police were checking locals' phones in Shanghai for foreign apps that can't be accessed in the mainland without a VPN.China's official nightly news broadcast Monday did not mention the unrest, but included a segment calling for unity around the current Covid measures. The broadcast also emphasized how the government was maintaining health services and delivery of daily necessities to people in lockdown.The purpose of the measures is to minimize Covid's impact on the economy and society, claimed an op-ed Tuesday in the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper. The article firmly ruled out the idea of relaxing controls. Stringent Covid measures this year have weighed heavily on business activity and economic growth in China. As of the third quarter, national GDP had grown by 3% year on year, far below the official target of around 5.5% set in March.As of Monday, 25.1% of China's GDP was negatively affected by Covid controls, according to a Nomura model. That's above the prior peak of 21.2% recorded in April during the lockdown in Shanghai.""The rapid increase in public discontent over the lockdowns over the past weekend may further cloud the road to reopening,"" Nomura analysts said. Analysts have attributed some of the frustration with zero-Covid to excessive lockdown measures at a local level — such as forcing people to stay home with no advance or official notice.In Beijing, many apartment communities successfully convinced local management they had no legal basis for a lockdown.

If that stays when markets close Wednesday, it would be the worst performance since it dropped 40.3% over the course of June.Ether is slated to end the month down 19%, which would also be the biggest lost since June's 47.4% drop.The slides come as investors grow increasingly wary of crypto following the collapse of exchange FTX.— Gina Francolla, Alex Harring  Wed, Nov 30 20225:13 AM EST Euro zone inflation dropped by more than expected in November, fueling market hopes that record-high price growth across the bloc has peaked and the European Central Bank will begin slowing its interest rate hikes next month.The consumer price index grew by 10% year-on-year, down from 10.6% in October and comfortably below a consensus projection of 10.4% in a Reuters poll of analysts.However, food price inflation, a key worry for policymakers, continued to accelerate, with falling energy prices accounting for the bulk of the slowdown.- Elliot Smith  Wed, Nov 30 20223:48 AM EST European markets were cautiously higher on Wednesday as regional investors monitored the latest inflation data from the euro zone in November.The pan-European Stoxx 600 was up 0.8% in early trade, with autos adding 1.8% to lead gains as all sectors and major bourses entered positive territory.Elsewhere overnight, Asia-Pacific shares were mostly higher on Wednesday even as the reading for China's November factory activity fell short of expectations, dropping to the lowest reading since April. - Elliot Smith  Tue, Nov 29 20226:51 PM EST A key part of the yield curve closely watched by Wall Street investors and analysts alike inverted further on Tuesday, potentially signaling a recession ahead. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury ticked up about 4 basis points to trade at 3.752% on Tuesday. At the same time, the two-year yield rose slightly to 4.481%. Yields move inverse to price, and a basis point is equal to 0.01%.The difference between yields, called the yield curve, is a recession signal when investors are getting better payback for snapping up shorter-term bonds than longer term ones. Currently, the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury bonds is more than 73 basis points, the widest in decades. What this inversion signals is that the Fed may have tamed inflation enough to cool down the economy and may be able to pause or pivot soon. It can also be read as a sign that a recession is on the horizon. —Carmen Reinicke  Tue, Nov 29 20226:28 PM EST Two reports issued on Wednesday should give investors some insight into the state of the U.S. labor market in advance of Friday's big payrolls report.The ADP jobs reading is due Wednesday at 8:15 a.m. ET.

2022-11-29,"S&P Global Ratings earlier this month affirmed its positive outlook on the country, citing a net external creditor position and the implementation of some of the government's long-desired structural reforms.South Africans have faced rolling blackouts as Eskom — which has long been a thorn in the side of the country's economy — contends with shortfalls in generation capacity due to equipment failures and diesel shortages.Headline inflation rose from an annual 7.5% in September to 7.6% in October, defying the South African Reserve Bank's expectations for price pressures to ease. South Africa's long-awaited economic reforms have begun to improve the country's outlook, but the age-old problems of political uncertainty and a failing power system still pose significant risks.The Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan has been a key tenet of President Cyril Ramaphosa's agenda since he succeeded Jacob Zuma as the country's leader in 2018. But deep divisions within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and his own cabinet have made for sluggish progress.The suite of reforms — focused on energy security, infrastructure development, food security, job creation and the green transition — is designed to create a ""sustainable, resilient and inclusive economy,"" the government says.And — some at least — appear to be working. S&P Global Ratings earlier this month affirmed its positive outlook on the country, saying that government measures to stimulate private sector activity could boost growth, and the measures had the potential to ease economic pressures.""There is some hope in the public finances in South Africa, mainly due to the increase in government revenues as a result of higher commodity exports, and also due to the progress made in reducing debt and debt distress, and to ushering a public deficit,"" Aleix Montana, Africa analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC last week.However, political frailties and persistent issues at a state-owned utility continue to pose present economic risks.Ramaphosa faces a ""perfect storm of inflation, electricity cuts and corruption accusations that will continue to deteriorate South Africa's profile and to pose risk for investments in the country,"" Montana said.A report into an alleged corruption scandal surrounding Ramaphosa is set to be examined by the National Assembly on Dec. 6, just 10 days before the party conference of his ruling ANC (African National Congress).Energy woesThough Ramaphosa is expected to secure a second five-year term, Montana said he will have to improve his credibility on economic and anti-corruption reforms in order to continue pushing through his agenda. The economy also remains at risk from persistent disruptions at state-owned companies, such as power utility Eskom.South Africans have faced rolling blackouts as Eskom — which has long been a thorn in the side of the country's economy — contends with shortfalls in generation capacity due to equipment failures and diesel shortages.The company has warned that power outages, known as ""load-shedding,"" will continue for the next six to 12 months, and recently said it had run out of funds to acquire the diesel needed to run auxiliary power plants that are deployed during periods of peak consumption or emergencies.Montana said that in order to secure sustained economic growth, the South African government will need to prioritize energy sustainability.""Energy will require financial assistance from international players, but they will also need to ensure that it doesn't have a negative impact on South African society,"" he said. ""Apart from financial challenges, a lot of citizens of South Africa are employed in Eskom or in the fossil fuels sector, so the government will need to ensure that in their plan, they mitigate this potential impact of transitioning from a fossil fuels-based economy to the implementation of renewables in order to sustain electricity stability.""Asked about this issue on a recent state visit to the U.K., Ramaphosa told CNBC's Arabile Gumede that the problems at Eskom started long before 2014, when former President Jacob Zuma appointed him to address the country's energy problems.""As we are generating electricity, power stations keep breaking — many of them are old — but we are trying with a new boat, the management that's in place to address this problem,"" Ramaphosa said.""So the problems of Eskom were seeds that were planted many years ago, rather than in 2014, and because we're dealing with huge, complicated and complex machinery, it's not a one-day fix, it can never be as these are very complex processes."" He added that the government was working to reduce load-shedding requirements and to ""ensure that the money's there,"" noting that Eskom ""used to be the best utility in the world.""""Do I have confidence that we will solve these problems? Yes, I do. I do have enormous confidence that we will solve them,"" he said.""But I think it's important to have an appreciation of where we've come from, and obviously, it is very easy to put all the blame on the president, to put all the blame on the government, and yet these problems have come way back from the past.""'Taming the monster' of inflationAlong with the domestic issues unique to South Africa, the country also faces the same inflationary pressures that have plagued economies around the world over the past year.Annual headline inflation rose to 7.6% in October, defying the South African Reserve Bank's expectations for price pressures to ease. This prompted the bank's Monetary Policy Committee to hike interest rates by an aggressive 75 basis points last week, taking the benchmark repo rate to 7%.This marked the seventh consecutive meeting at which monetary policy had been tightened, and central bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago said in a press conference that it must ""tame the monster of inflation.""With prices rising much faster than the central bank's 3-6% target, Kganyago noted that the SARB needs to see clear evidence that inflation has not just peaked, but begun to sustainably decline toward the midpoint of the range.But further monetary tightening will place additional pressure on the economy.""We think that inflation is unlikely to return within the target range (let alone the midpoint) in the coming months, keeping policymakers in tightening mode well into 2023,"" said Virág Fórizs, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. She flagged that food inflation continues to increase, offsetting some of the effects of softening fuel price pressures, while core inflation is likely to remain high. Capital Economics expects inflation to hover around 7.5% annually until early 2023, before dropping markedly around the middle of the year.Fórizs said the weakness of the economy is unlikely to prevent further rate hikes, with growth concerns playing second fiddle to inflation worries. South African GDP contracted by 0.7% in the second quarter.""While the end of the tightening cycle is not yet in sight, we expect the pace of tightening to slow over the next MPC meetings,"" she noted.Three MPC members voted to hike rates by 75 basis points last week, while two voted for 50 basis points. It marked an apparent softening of approach by some who voted for a 100-basis-point rise at the previous meeting.""All in all, we've penciled in 100bp of further increases in the repo rate, to 8.00%, by Q2 2023,"" Fórizs said."
2022-11-30,"Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo says China has prioritized its national security over economic growth and trade with other nations.The Commerce Secretary says the country has forced the U.S. to defend its workers, businesses and those of its allies and partners.Raimondo said China is attempting to game the global system by stacking Chinese representatives on international technology standard-setting bodies to promote the country's values and spread its influence.  It's now clear to U.S. officials that China, once considered a possible economic and political ally, has become an emerging threat to national security, U.S. companies and American workers, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Wednesday.""Over the past decade, China's leaders have made clear that they do not plan to pursue political and economic reform and are instead pursuing an alternative vision of their country's future,""  Raimondo said in a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""China's reprioritization away from economic growth toward national security and its assertive military behavior means that we have to rethink how we protect our national security interests while also promoting our interests in trade and investment.""related investing newsTesla and more: Morgan Stanley names EV stocks set to benefit as supply chains move WestGanesh Raoa day agoRaimondo said Chinese leaders have made it apparent over the last decade that ""increasing the role of the state society and economy,"" ""constraining the free flow of capital"" and ""decoupling in technology areas of the future"" is more important than political and economic reform.""Probably most disturbingly is they're accelerating their efforts to fuse economic and technology policies with their military ambitions,"" Raimondo said. ""And as China's economy has grown in size and influence, so too, has its commitment to using nonmarket trade and investment practices in ways that are forcing us, compelling us, to defend United States businesses and workers and those of our allies and partners.""Raimondo said China is attempting to game the global system by stacking Chinese representatives on international technology standard-setting bodies to promote the country's values and spread its influence. She said it undermines good governance, puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage ""and puts at risk many of our fundamental values, such as the free flow of information and data privacy."" Raimondo's speech comes about two weeks after President Joe Biden met for about three hours with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the G-20 summit in Indonesia where he objected to China's growing aggression to neighboring Taiwan. The leaders pushed for a bilateral relationship amid rising tensions due to China's intimidation of Taiwan.Strict measures were implemented under the CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law by Biden in August, to ensure research and innovation investments ""can never be used to benefit China's military,"" said Raimondo. The administration fears that semiconductor chips used to manufacture military equipment could be used against the U.S.In October, the Biden administration imposed export restrictions on semiconductors manufactured in China by U.S. companies. The Commerce Department also issued license restrictions on the export of certain chips that can be used in modern weapons systems and barred U.S. citizens from working for China's chip manufacturing industry.Raimondo said the U.S. government seeks to outcompete China in shaping the global economy and defend against an ""increasing and emerging array of practices"" aimed at U.S. workers and businesses and posing a threat to national security.""China today poses a set of growing challenges to our national security,"" she said. ""That is a fact. It's deploying its military in ways that undermine the security of our allies and our partners and the free flow of global trade.""But Raimondo also acknowledged that the U.S. benefits from the over $750 billion annual trade market with China, which is America's third largest export market. Exports support over 750,000 American jobs among large and small industries, she said.""We want to continue to promote trade, continue to promote investment. But in areas that have no potential to undermine our interests, our values, our national security, our economic security, and at the same time using every tool in our toolbox to protect our companies and counter unfair economic practices,"" Raimondo said."
2022-11-30,"Japan's factory output fell for a second consecutive month in October, as stalling global demand and lingering supply bottlenecks put a lid on Japanese manufacturers' production plans.The feeble business activity highlights challenges for the world's third-largest economy, which has been lagging behind peers in recovering from the pandemic even as the government readies another stimulus package to counter 40-year-high inflation. Japan's factory output fell for a second consecutive month in October, as stalling global demand and lingering supply bottlenecks put a lid on Japanese manufacturers' production plans.The feeble business activity highlights challenges for the world's third-largest economy, which has been lagging behind peers in recovering from the pandemic even as the government readies another stimulus package to counter 40-year-high inflation.""The pickup in production is pausing. For October-December, (Japan's) production will likely be almost flat or slightly decrease from the previous quarter,"" said Shumpei Fujita, economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, pointing to the global economic slowdown as a culprit.Factory output fell 2.6% in October from a month earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis, government data showed on Wednesday. The dip was larger than economists' median forecast of a 1.5% decline and followed a revised 1.7% decrease in September.Production machinery output slipped 5.4%, taking a hit from soft demand for equipment to make semiconductors and flat-panel displays. Electronic parts and devices output decreased 4.1% as semiconductors and liquid crystal panels were weak. Decreasing demand for smartphones and electronic devices in big markets such as China led to the weak output in related sectors, a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) official told a media briefing.But production in the auto-related sector, a key industry for Japan Inc with many suppliers involved, advanced 5.6%. While output of compact cars for the domestic market grew, production and shipment of export-oriented larger vehicles was down due to chip shortages, the METI official said.METI cut its assessment of industrial output for the first time in five months, saying ""production is gradually picking up, but some weaknesses are observed.""Manufacturers surveyed by METI expected output to rise 3.3% in November and another 2.4% in December, although the forecast figures are normally more bullish than actual results.Fresh Covid-19 outbreaks in Chinese cities pose another risk to Japan's production outlook, as major Japanese carmakers including Toyota and Honda said they have adjusted production in China due to local lockdowns. The impact of China's recent lockdown remains unclear, the METI official said, adding the spill-over effects for Japanese manufacturers may only appear in November or December statistics.After a surprise contraction in July-September, economists forecast annualized 3.1% growth in Japan's October-December gross domestic product, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.To counter increasing costs for households and businesses, partly exacerbated by the yen's decline this year to three decade lows, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has sought another 29 trillion yen ($210 billion) extra budget, which will likely pass the parliament later this week.Toward the first half of 2023, ""weaker production and exports, coupled with curbs on consumption amid inflationary pressure, may result in a slowdown in Japan's economy,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute."

The 2-year rate was down 13 basis points on the day at 4.343%. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. One basis point is equal to 0.01%. ""It makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,"" Powell said in a speech at the Brookings Institution. ""The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.""Traders had been pricing in a 50 basis-point rate hike for December after four straight increases of 75 basis points. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy all year in an effort to quell strong inflationary pressures battering the country.However, the Fed's effectiveness in driving down inflation is not completely clear yet.The Labor Department said Wednesday that job openings for October came in at 10.33 million, slightly less than a 10.4 million FactSet estimate.Meanwhile, a revision to the gross domestic product reading from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed the economy was stronger than previously thought. Third-quarter GDP increased at a 2.9% annual rate, higher than the 2.6% figure reported in the first estimateThat came shortly after both retreated on the back of data from processing firm ADP showing private hiring fell sharply in November and came in below expectations. The data could indicate a tightening economy, which would give optimism for investors who are looking for the Fed to slow or pivot on interest rate hikes."

By the same token, Morgan Stanley estimates that Indian manufacturing's share of GDP will ""rise from 15.6% of GDP currently to 21% by 2031"" — which implies that manufacturing revenue could increase three times from the current $447 billion to around $1,490 billion, according to the bank.""Multinationals are more optimistic than ever about investing in India … and the government is encouraging investment by both building infrastructure and supplying land for factories,"" Morgan Stanley said.""India's advantages [include] abundant low-cost labor, the low cost of manufacturing, openness to investment, business-friendly policies and a young demographic with a strong penchant for consumption,"" said Sumedha Dasgupta, a senior analyst from the Economist Intelligence Unit.These factors make make India an attractive choice for setting up manufacturing hubs until the end of the decade, she said. Salient sticking points that could challenge Morgan Stanley's forecast include a prolonged global recession, since India is a highly trade-dependent economy with nearly 20% of its output exported.Other risk factors cited by the U.S. investment bank include supply of skilled labor, adverse geopolitical events and policy errors which may arise from voting in a ""weaker government.""A global slowdown may dampen India's export businesses outlook, India's finance ministry said last Thursday.

""If inflation keeps coming down, then markets will keep running higher, as investors will conclude that the Fed won't need to raise rates as high, or keep them high for as long, as previously expected.""While the Fed takes in a broad range of measures to gauge inflation, it prefers the PCE index as it takes into account changes in consumer behavior such as substituting less expensive goods for pricier items. That's different than the consumer price index, which is a raw measure of changes in prices.Policymakers view core inflation as a more reliable measure as food and energy prices tend to fluctuate more than other items.In other economic news Thursday, the Labor Department reported that weekly jobless claims totaled 225,000, a decline of 16,000 from the previous week and below the 235,000 estimate.Another jobs report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicated that planned layoffs increased 127% on a monthly basis in November and were up 417% from a year ago. Even with the massive surge, the firm noted the year-to-date layoff total is the second-lowest ever in a data set that dates to 1993.The data comes at a pivotal time for the Fed, which is in the midst of an interest rate-hiking campaign in an effort to bring down inflation.In a speech Wednesday, Chairman Jerome Powell said he saw some signs that price increases are abating but added that he needs to see more consistent evidence before the central bank can change gears on policy. He did, however, indicate that he thinks the rate hikes can start getting smaller, perhaps as early as December.""The truth is that the path ahead for inflation remains highly uncertain,"" Powell said.The PCE data showed that the numbers remain volatile. Goods inflation rose 0.3% for the month after declining the previous three months, while services inflation increased 0.4%, down from two consecutive 0.6% increases. Economists have been looking for a shift back to a more services-based economy after outsized demand for goods played a major role in the inflation surge in 2021.Food inflation increased 0.4% while energy goods and services prices rose 2.5%.The Fed is watching the jobs market closely for more signs of cooling inflation.Jobless claims had been trending slightly higher, and the level of continuing claims increased 57,000 to 1.61 million, the highest level since February."

2022-12-02,"Nonfarm payrolls increased 263,000 for the month while the unemployment rate was 3.7%, the Labor Department reported Friday.The payrolls number was well above the 200,000 estimate, while the unemployment rate was in line.Average hourly earnings jumped 0.6% for the month, double the estimate, and 5.1% annually versus the 4.6% expectation. Job growth was much better than expected in November despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive efforts to slow the labor market and tackle inflation.Nonfarm payrolls increased 263,000 for the month while the unemployment rate was 3.7%, the Labor Department reported Friday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 200,000 on the payrolls number and 3.7% for the jobless rate.The monthly gain was a slight decrease from October's upwardly revised 284,000. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged lower to 6.7%.  The numbers likely will do little to slow a Fed that has been raising interest rates steadily this year to bring down inflation still running near its highest level in more than 40 years. The rate increases have brought the Fed's benchmark overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 3.75%-4%.In another blow to the Fed's anti-inflation efforts, average hourly earnings jumped 0.6% for the month, double the Dow Jones estimate. Wages were up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis, also well above the 4.6% expectation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 350 points after the report on worries the hot jobs data could make the Fed even more aggressive. However, stocks shaved most of their losses as the trading session neared its close. Treasury yields initially jumped on the jobs news before turning mixed later.""To have 263,000 jobs added even after policy rates have been raised by some [375] basis points is no joke,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""The labor market is hot, hot, hot, heaping pressure on the Fed to continue raising policy rates.""Leisure and hospitality led the job gains, adding 88,000 positions.Other sector gainers included health care (45,000), government (42,000) and other services, a category that includes personal and laundry services and which showed a total gain of 24,000. Social assistance saw a rise of 23,000, which the Labor Department said brings the sector back to where it was in February 2020 before the Covid pandemic.Construction added 20,000 positions, while information was up 19,000 and manufacturing saw a gain of 14,000.On the downside, retail establishments reported a loss of 30,000 positions heading into what is expected to be a busy holiday shopping season. Transportation and warehousing also saw a decline, down 15,000.The numbers come as the Fed has raised rates half a dozen times this year, including four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases.Despite the moves, job gains had been running strong this year if a bit lower than the rapid pace of 2021. On monthly basis, payrolls have been up an average of 392,000 against 562,000 for 2021. Demand for labor continues to outstrip supply, with about 1.7 positions open for every available worker.""The Fed is tightening monetary policy but somebody forgot to tell the labor market,"" said Fitch Ratings chief economist Brian Coulton. ""The good thing about these numbers is that it shows the U.S. economy firmly got back to growth in the second half of the year. But job expansion continuing at this speed will do nothing to ease the labor supply-demand imbalance that is worrying the Fed.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week said the job gains are ""far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time"" and said wage pressures are contributing to inflation.""To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation,"" he said during a speech Wednesday in Washington, D.C.Markets expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage point when it meets later this month. That's likely to be followed by a few more increases in 2023 before the central bank can pause to see how its policy moves are impacting the economy, according to current market pricing and statements from several central bank officials.Friday's numbers had little impact on rate expectations, with traders assigning a nearly 80% probability that the Fed would step down to a half-point increase, according to CME Group data.""The economy's big and it takes a long time, many months, for these things to filter through,"" Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said of the rate increases. ""The impact of these rate hikes hasn't really been felt yet. Powell's rightfully being a little cautious.""Powell has stressed the importance of getting labor force participation back to its pre-pandemic level. However, the November reports showed that participation fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.1%, tied for the lowest level of the year as the labor force fell by 186,000 and is now slightly below the February 2020 level."
2022-12-02,"This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets. Markets in the Asia-Pacific mostly fell while investors looked for clarity after China signaled slight easing of its stringent Covid restrictions.In Japan, the Nikkei 225 traded 1.59% lower to 27,777.90 and the Topix fell 1.64% to 1,953.98. The Kospi in South Korea fell 1.84% to 2,434,33 as the nation saw its annualized consumer price index for November inch lower from the previous month.

In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite also fell 0.29% and the Shenzhen Component lost 0.4%.Overnight in the U.S., the Dow closed nearly 200 points lower ahead of a key jobs report, in which economists expect to see slower growth but resilience for November amid announcements of layoffs and hiring freezes.  Fri, Dec 2 202212:27 AM EST Singapore and New York have been ranked as the most expensive cities to live in this year, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).EIU's survey showed the average price of goods in 172 major cities globally rose 8.1% in local currency terms this year, citing a poll that the organization conducted between Aug. 16th and Sept. 16th.The reading marks a significant increase from a 3.5% rise in prices seen in the same survey that the organization conducted last year.— Charmaine Jacob  Thu, Dec 1 20229:18 PM EST India is projected to overtake Japan and Germany to become the world's third-largest economy, S&P Global and Morgan Stanley forecasted in a report.S&P's prediction is premised upon the projection that India's annual nominal GDP growth will average 6.3% through 2030. Similarly, Morgan Stanley estimates that India's GDP is likely to more than double from current levels by 2031.On Wednesday, India recorded a year-on-year GDP growth of 6.3% for the July to September quarter, fractionally beating Reuters poll estimates of 6.2%.— Lee Ying Shan  Thu, Dec 1 20229:11 PM EST Citi says investors don't need to give up entirely on growth by pivoting to a defensive portfolio of stocks ahead of a potential recession.The investment bank named six global stocks which offer ""low risk, quality and growth"" combined.CNBC Pro subscribers can read more here.— Ganesh Rao  Thu, Dec 1 20227:11 PM EST South Korea's annualized inflation for November came in at 5%, lower than estimates of 5.1% surveyed in a Reuters poll.The latest reading marks slight easing from 5.7% in October and off an all-time peak of 6.3% seen in July.– Jihye Lee  Thu, Dec 1 20229:04 PM EST BlackRock's ETF division says the investing environment has fundamentally changed, which has ""profound implications"" for portfolios looking ahead.In its 2023 investor guide, Blackrock's iShares, one of the largest providers of exchange-traded-funds in the world, said the shift brings with it ""profound implications for portfolio construction.""CNBC Pro subscribers can read more here.— Weizhen Tan  Thu, Dec 1 20223:30 PM EST Stocks were unable to continue Wednesday's rally because investors were awaiting a key jobs report coming Friday, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.He said investors were purposefully pulling back ahead of non-farm payroll data coming in the morning. Investors will also be watching for data on hourly pay and the unemployment rate.""US stocks were unable to hold onto earlier gains as Wall Street digested a swathe of economic data that showed inflation is easing and the labor market is cooling,"" Moya said. ""It's been a nice rally but no one wants to be aggressively bullish heading into the NFP report.""Investors will be looking for the right, middle-ground data, said Megan Horneman, chief investing officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. That means it's weak enough to show interest rate hikes are having the intended impact of economic contracting, while being strong enough to signal a recession could be avoided.""A big number will spook the markets further that the Fed's not going to be able to slow down their pace of rate hikes,"" said Megan Horneman, chief investing officer at Verdence Capital Advisors, of Friday's jobs data.With ""a so-so number, I think the markets can maybe rally on that,"" she added. ""But if you get a really weak number, it's just going to spook investors after such a strong rally we've seen in November.""— Alex Harring  Thu, Dec 1 20222:45 PM EST Thursday marked the first day of a new trading month as the market came off a winning November.The S&P 500 and Dow each had the second straight month of gains, rising 5.38% and 5.67%, respectively. That monthly streak was the first for each since August 2021.The Nasdaq Composite gained 4.37%, which was its second positive month in a row.

2022-12-02," The U.S. job market beat expectations again in November, adding 263,000 payrolls led by the service sector.Leisure and hospitality was the top category for job gains, according to a report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, adding 88,000 jobs. Roughly 62,000 of those jobs were in food and drink services, the report said.Health care and social assistance was the second-biggest category last month, adding more than 68,000 jobs. When those groups are combined in a broader category with education, as some economists do, the gains rise to 82,000.Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan professor and former chief economist of the U.S. Labor Department, said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that the strength of those sectors show how the economy is still reacting to the impact of the Covid pandemic.""If you look at where the job growth was in this report, 170,000 of those jobs were in two sectors, sectors where we need people: education and health services, which has barely recovered back to its pre-pandemic level, and leisure and hospitality, which has not recovered back to anywhere near its pre-pandemic level of employment,"" Stevenson said.Government employment also had a strong month, adding 42,000 jobs.Despite the headline beat and strength in the service sector, there were still weak spots in the economy. The retail trade and transportation and warehousing categories both lost jobs last month.Those declines come as retail and e-commerce companies have struggled with inventory management and the shift in consumer spending after an online shopping boom during the pandemic.""So we've got some sectors that are still in recovery, and other sectors I think that got ahead of their skis,"" Stevenson said."
2022-12-05,"John Bolton, the onetime national security advisor to former President Donald Trump, said he is ""absolutely"" considering launching a 2024 presidential bid.Bolton called it ""un-American"" for Trump to ""challenge the Constitution"" when he suggested it could be terminated in order to put him back in the White House.Bolton, noting that many Republican leadership roles are currently up for consideration, said that every prospective candidate should repudiate Trump. John Bolton, who was former President Donald Trump's national security advisor for more than a year, said Monday he is ""absolutely"" considering launching a 2024 presidential bid — in large part to challenge Trump.Bolton, speaking on NBC News' ""Meet The Press Now,"" said the ""one thing"" that would spur him to run would be ""to make it clear to the people of this country that Donald Trump is unacceptable as the Republican nominee.""Bolton called it ""un-American"" for Trump to ""challenge the Constitution"" when he suggested over the weekend that the nation's supreme law could be terminated in order to put him back in the White House.Bolton, who has periodically been a vocal Trump critic since departing his administration in September 2019, called the former president's declaration ""an existential threat to the republic itself.""Trump, who has regularly spread false claims of widespread election fraud since his loss to President Joe Biden in 2020, claimed in a social media post Saturday that, ""A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.""Trump appeared to walk back that statement earlier Monday, saying it was ""Fake News"" to claim he ""wanted to 'terminate' the Constitution."" In follow-up posts, Trump declared in all caps that ""IF AN ELECTION IS IRREFUTABLY FRAUDULENT, IT SHOULD GO TO THE RIGHTFUL WINNER OR, AT A MINIMUM, BE REDONE.""Bolton rejected Trump's clarifications, saying his sentiment is ""not merely wrong and outrageous, it is disqualifying.""""Donald Trump, if he were to take the oath of office again, God forbid, would either be lying about preserving, protecting and defending the Constitution, or maybe he wouldn't say it at all,"" Bolton said. ""You can't have this kind of approach. It's not something one can disagree with. This is foundational to the republic.""Bolton called on GOP leaders to denounce Trump, who is currently the only Republican to announce his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election. Numerous other Republicans, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump's ex-Vice President Mike Pence, are expected to be gearing up to run for the GOP nomination.The Biden administration said attacks on the Constitution should be ""universally condemned."" Many top Republicans, however, have avoided publicly addressing Trump's remarks when asked for comment.Bolton, noting that many Republican leadership roles are currently up for consideration, said that every prospective candidate should repudiate Trump's remarks.""And honestly, if they don't, there's one thing that would get me to get into the presidential race, which I looked at in prior elections, it would be to make it clear to the people of this country that Donald Trump is unacceptable as the Republican nominee,"" Bolton said.When pressed on those remarks, Bolton confirmed he would ""absolutely"" consider getting into the 2024 race. To be a presidential candidate, he said, one must not only declare support for the Constitution but also opposition to ""people who would undercut it.""Referencing the defunct House Un-American Activities Committee, Bolton said, ""I think when you challenge the Constitution itself the way Trump has done, that is un-American.""He challenged other Republicans to say the same. ""I don't see why they aren't saying it right now,"" he said.Nearly all GOP voters ""disagree that Donald Trump is more important than the Constitution,"" Bolton said. ""What does a candidate have to lose by appealing to 95% of the base of the Republican Party?""He said he wanted to see ""Shermanesque statements"" denouncing Trump from other potential candidates, and if he does not, ""then I'm going to seriously consider getting in.""Asked for his views on the 2024 race and what his potential campaign might look like, Bolton predicted that national security issues will dominate that election cycle ""The isolationist virus that Trump has let loose needs to be addressed, as well,"" he added.Bolton contrasted Trump, a ""whiner,"" with the late GOP President Ronald Reagan's more ""optimistic"" message. The former national security advisor said his possible presidential platform might be ""very Reaganesque.""Bolton described his politics as ""pretty libertarian"" and said he was ""not a social conservative.""He added that he believes the 2024 presidential field will be ""very crowded,"" and that he might make a decision on whether to run ""earlier than some would think."""
2022-12-05,"CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said wearing a mask is an everyday precaution that people can take to reduce their chances of catching or spreading a respiratory virus.Flu and respiratory syncytial virus are circulating at high levels at the same time Covid is picking up, straining hospital emergency departments.Walensky strongly encouraged everyone who is eligible to receive their Covid booster and flu shot.  The Centers for Disease Control Prevention on Monday encouraged people to wear masks to help reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses this season as Covid, flu and RSV circulate at the same time.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a call with reporters, said wearing a mask is one of several everyday precautions that people can take to reduce their chances of catching or spreading a respiratory virus during the busy holiday season.""We also encourage you to wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses,"" said Walensky, adding that people living in areas with high levels of Covid transmission should especially consider masking.The CDC director said the agency is considering expanding its system of Covid community levels to take into account other respiratory viruses such as the flu. The system is the basis for when CDC advises the public to wear masks. But Walensky encouraged people to take proactive action.""One need not wait on CDC action in order to put a mask on,"" Walensky said. ""We would encourage all of those preventive measures — hand washing, staying home when you're sick, masking, increased ventilation — during respiratory virus season, but especially in areas of high Covid-19 community levels."" About 5% of the U.S. population lives in counties where the CDC is officially recommending masks due to high Covid levels. The CDC continues to recommend masking for anyone travelling by plane, train, bus or other forms of public transportation, Walensky said.People with weak immune systems and those who otherwise face a heightened risk of severe disease should also consider wearing a mask, the CDC director said.Walensky strongly encouraged everyone eligible to receive their flu shot and Covid booster. Flu vaccination coverage is lagging for at-risk groups — children under age 5, pregnant women, and at-risk seniors — compared with last year, the CDC director said. There is no vaccine for RSV.""I want to emphasize that the flu vaccine can be life saving and importantly, there's still time to get vaccinated to be protected against flu this season and its potential serious consequences,"" Walensky said.The flu has arrived early and hit the U.S. hard with hospitalizations at a decade high for this time of year. More than 8.7 million people have fallen ill, 78,000 have been hospitalized, and 4,500 people have died from the flu this season, according to CDC data. Fourteen children have died from the flu so far this season.More than 19,000 people were hospitalized with the flu during the week ending Nov. 26, nearly double the previous week, according to CDC data.People hospitalized with Covid also increased 27% during the week ending Dec. 2, according to CDC data. And respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, has been hospitalizing children at higher rate than in previous years. Walensky said RSV appears to have peaked in the Southeast and may be leveling off in the Mid-Atlantic, New England and Midwest though circulation of the virus remains high in much of the nation.""We now face yet another surge of illness. Another moment of overstretched capacity and really one of tragic and often preventable sadness,"" Walensky said, as she thanked health-care workers for their service during the repeated surges of illness they have confronted since the Covid pandemic began.Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, board chair of the American Medical Association, said the circulation of Covid, flu and RSV at the same is a ""a perfect storm for a terrible holiday season."" Fryhofer said she understands many people are tired of receiving repeated Covid shots, but getting vaccinated is the best way to avoiding falling ill over the holidays.""You could get really, really sick this year and ruin your holiday celebrations if you don't get vaccinated,"" Fryhofer said during Monday's call.The Children's Hospital Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics last month asked the Biden administration to declare a public health emergency in response to the surge of pediatric hospitalizations from RSV and the flu.Correction: Dr. Walensky said this season is ""another moment of overstretched capacity and really one of tragic and often preventable sadness.""

2022-12-05,"U.S. Treasury yields rose Monday as investors weighed the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will continue hiking rates until a recession hits.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was last up by about 9 basis points to 3.589%. The 2-year Treasury yield climbed 12 basis points to 4.40%. Yields and prices have an inverted relationship, with on basis point equalling 0.01%. The move in yields came as a higher-than-expected ISM report for November indicated an acceleration in growth from October's reading of 54.4. Signs of a resilient economy could signal a more aggressive Fed is needed to tamp down inflation.Markets also continued to assess last week's nonfarm payrolls data, which showed that the U.S. economy added more jobs than expected in November. Average hourly earnings also rose more than economists had anticipated.Tightness in the labor market has historically been closely linked to high levels of inflation. The Federal Reserve has been trying to push back against rising prices, which has led to four consecutive hikes of 75 basis points so far this year.Investors are also looking ahead to next week's Federal Reserve December policy meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to hike rates by 50 basis points."
2022-12-06,"CEOs from JPMorgan, General Motors, Walmart, United and Union Pacific are preparing for an economic slowdown.Among the issues cited are rising interest rates, inflation and geopolitical concerns.The companies are taking a conservative approach to 2023. As 2023 approaches and the prospect of a recession looms, corporate America is preparing for a slowdown in consumer spending.CEOs of major companies including Walmart and General Motors joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday morning to talk inflation, interest rates, geopolitics and what it all means for their outlooks in the new year.Here's what they said: Rising interest rates, record inflation, geopolitical pressure and other factors could coalesce into a recession, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC.Savings and government aid during the pandemic are helping keep consumer wallets stable, but inflation and rate hikes are ""eroding everything,"" he said.The CEO projected that the elevated consumer spending of 2022 will not last much longer, and underscored the risk posed by rising interest rates as the Fed works to curb inflation.This year's geopolitical upheaval, including the war in Ukraine and strained trade with China, are also among the ""storm clouds"" Dimon is watching. As the dollar strengthens, he noted that international trade for something like oil will continue to get more expensive since weaker currencies are forced to match the difference.  ""When you look out forward, those things may well derail the economy and cause this mild to hard recession that people are worried about,"" Dimon said. ""It could be a hurricane. We simply don't know."" General Motors CEO Mary Barra anticipates economic headwinds next year but is not sounding the alarms for a recession just yet.""I'm not going to call a recession, that's for economists to do,"" Barra told CNBC. ""But right now, we're still seeing a pretty strong consumer.""Even so, the car manufacturer is proceeding with caution to be prepared for a potential collapse in demand, similar to what other industries have seen. During the pandemic, when consumers were spending less on travel and services, some industries saw elevated demand and were caught off guard when that demand later disappeared.Barra said GM is preparing ""a fairly conservative 2023"" cost-wise to avoid being blindsided, but that she is still seeing ""pent-up demand"" lingering from the pandemic.Barra also expects issues problems from the pandemic, such as semiconductor shortages and strained supply chains, to persist into 2023 despite improvements each quarter. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon doesn't want a recession, but he thinks it might be a necessary evil to ease inflation for his customers.""We've got some customers who are more budget conscious that have been under inflation pressure now for months,"" McMillon said. ""Should the Fed do what it needs to do, even if it is a much harder landing than we'd like? I think inflation needs to be dealt with.""Though Walmart is still seeing strong spending, McMillon has spotted more conservative spending in certain categories like electronics and toys.Walmart has seen its pandemic-era staffing issues begin to subside as it has raised wages, but McMillon noted there's still hiring pressure at the cashier level. If a hard recession hits, McMillon ensured that Walmart would not turn to staffing cuts.""Customers and members need to be served so that'll drive our headcount. Growth will probably continue to go up,"" said McMillon. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told CNBC that his company is entering the year with optimism but that 2023 might see a ""mild recession induced by the Fed.""Business travel is enjoying a steady rebound from its pandemic-era collapse, but Kirby said that traveler demand is plateauing, which might indicate ""pre-recessionary behavior.""And even though the industry is in the ""eighth inning"" of Covid recovery, Kirby said it is still battling problems left over from the pandemic, such as a pilot shortage and expensive fuel.For now, Airlines have reaped the benefits of hybrid work, with the increase in remote work giving people more flexibility to travel, said Kirby.United still maintains a positive outlook as its revenue numbers continue to rise. Kirby said the company is ""coming back to near all-time profit margins.""""If I didn't watch CNBC in the morning – which I do – the word recession wouldn't be in my vocabulary,"" Kirby said. ""You just can't see it in our data."" Shipping is slowing down, Union Pacific Railroads CEO Lance Fritz told CNBC, a sign that consumer spending is tapering off and the economy is tightening.""The housing market has clearly slowed and parcel packaging has clearly slowed and we are seeing that in paper and parcel shipments,"" he said.Fritz left it up to the Fed to decide whether putting pressure on the consumer's wallet – and potentially triggering a 2023 recession – is worth slowing down inflation. As rates continue rise, he said spending and demand will surely come down.""The Fed is trying to hit all of us in the line of fire with a slower economy and hurting demand. It's not good,"" said Fritz.

2022-12-06,"As of Monday, the negative impact of China's Covid controls on its economy fell to 19.3% of China's total GDP — down from 25.1% a week ago, Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu and a team said in a report.The figure was far lower, near 4%, in early October.In the last several days, local governments have relaxed some virus testing requirements, allowing people in cities such as Beijing and Zhengzhou to take public transportation without having to show proof of a negative test result. BEIJING — China's Covid lockdowns are having a lessening impact on the economy for the first time since early October, according to Nomura.However, analysts at the Japanese bank warned that the road ahead will be challenging as China doesn't appear to be ready for a spike in infections.As of Monday, the negative impact of China's Covid controls on its economy fell to 19.3% of China's total GDP — down from 25.1% a week ago, Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu and a team said in a report.Last week's 25.1% figure was higher than that seen during the two-month Shanghai lockdown in the spring, according to Nomura's model. In early October, the figure was far lower, near 4%.In the last several days, local governments have relaxed some virus testing requirements, allowing people in cities such as Beijing and Zhengzhou to take public transportation without having to show proof of a negative test result. If they test positive for Covid-19, Beijing residents at least are increasingly being quarantined at home instead of being made to do so at a centralized facility.As of Tuesday morning, Beijing city said proof of a negative Covid test from within two or three days was no longer required to enter public areas such as malls. But the level of initial implementation varied.China has shown signs that gradual easing of its stringent Covid controls could be on its way. The country trimmed quarantine times in mid-November. Last week, a vice premier downplayed the severity of the Omicron variant. However, the country also reported a surge in virus infections which reached daily record highs in the last few weeks. The case count has subsided in recent days, amid a decline in mandatory virus testing.""Ending zero Covid is encouraging and should be quite positive for markets, but we caution that the road to reopening may be gradual, painful and bumpy,"" the Nomura analysts said.""Despite﻿ the substantial resources devoted to the heavy-handed ZCS over the past two years, China does not appear to be well prepared for a massive wave of Covid infections, and it may have to pay for its procrastination on embracing a 'living with Covid' approach.""

2022-12-06,"The United States has just about 90 million planted acres of corn, and there's a reason people refer to the crop as yellow gold.In 2021, U.S. corn was worth over $86 billion, according to calculations from FarmDoc and the United States Department of Agriculture.According to the USDA, the U.S. is the largest consumer, producer and exporter of corn in the world.""We're really good at [corn production],"" Seth Meyer, chief economist at the USDA, told CNBC. ""And that's why you see big acres, big demand, export competitiveness.""It's not just what we eat.""We turbocharged the value of corn through the application of science,"" Scott Irwin, agricultural economist and professor at the University of Illinois, told CNBC.Corn is in what we buy, including medications and textiles, and corn is turned into ethanol, which helps to fuel cars across the nation.The rest of the world relies on U.S. corn, too. At $2.2 billion in 2019, corn is the most heavily subsidized of all crops in the country.""A lot of these subsidies ... do get embedded into the cost of farmland and they essentially bid up the price of farmland marginally,"" Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute and former USDA chief economist, told CNBC.

After big losses Monday, stocks tumbled again Tuesday: The Nasdaq lost 2%, the S&P 500 fell 1.4%, and the Dow slid more than 1%. Even with China relaxing its Covid restrictions, which should bolster that country's economy, investors have become increasingly worried that the Federal Reserve may keep up its inflation-fighting rate hikes for longer than hoped for.

The potential for a recession next year, particularly as the Fed works to cool the economy. Several of America's top CEOs appeared on CNBC Tuesday to weigh in on the possibility of a slowdown. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said a number of factors, including geopolitical crises and sustained rate hikes, ""may well derail the economy and cause this mild to hard recession that people are worried about."" Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, meanwhile, said a recession might be necessary to take down inflation. And while GM CEO Mary Barra said she wouldn't call whether there would be a recession, she said the automaker plans to be ""fairly conservative"" in 2023. Sen. Raphael Warnock made history Tuesday night by becoming the first full-term Black U.S. senator elected by Georgia. His victory in a runoff against Republican candidate and former football star Herschel Walker – who had the backing of former President Donald Trump – also gave Democrats a 51-49 edge in the Senate, giving them more leverage and putting an exclamation point on a much-better-than-expected midterm election cycle for the party. While Democrats lost the House, narrowly, they actually gained a seat in the Senate. Usually, an incumbent president's party suffers big losses during the midterms. Now, while President Joe Biden likely won't be able to advance his legislative agenda for the next two years, he will now likely have an easier time confirming judges and any Cabinet appointments he may have to make.Read more: Trump Organization found guilty in criminal tax fraud case It's a first for the United Auto Workers.

2022-12-08,"The Biden administration's fix to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has benefited hundreds of thousands of borrowers. More relief is on the way. In October 2021, the Biden administration announced a one-year opportunity for student loan borrowers pursuing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness to get closer to being debt-free.Signed into law by then-President George W. Bush in 2007, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program allows certain nonprofit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years, or 120 payments. However, the program has been plagued by problems, making people who actually get the relief a rarity.Thanks to the policy fix known as the Limited PSLF waiver, close to 360,000 borrowers have now qualified for $24 billion in loan forgiveness, according to U.S. Department of Education data analyzed by higher-education expert Mark Kantrowitz.More from Personal Finance:Biden's student loan forgiveness plan is on holdInflation-adjusted college costs declineThese colleges promise no student debtThe average borrower got more than $67,000 in student debt cleared.""These borrowers previously faced obstacles based on frustrating technicalities despite having worked in a qualifying public service job,"" Kantrowitz said.The reforms under the Biden administration included reassessing borrowers' timelines and counting some payments that were previously ineligible because of a borrower's loan type or repayment plan.Although the opportunity ended this October, borrowers still have options if they didn't benefit from the one-year fix. The Education Department has said that some borrowers in the public service sector will be eligible for a one-time adjustment of their payment count, even if they missed out on the Limited PSLF waiver. The adjustment will occur next July.This could result in borrowers getting credit for certain payments that were previously disqualified toward their needed 120 payments, including partial and late payments, and those not counted because of a borrowers' loan type or repayment plan.Months during which a borrower was enrolled in a deferment of their payments or a forbearance may also count toward their timeline. To qualify for the one-time relief, though, you need to have Direct loans. If you have either a Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) or a Federal Perkins Loan, you should consolidate those into Direct loans with your servicer by May 1, 2023.There are also some permanent changes coming to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, starting next July 1, which also include allowing borrowers to get credit for late payments or months in certain types of deferments. There are typically three primary requirements for public service loan forgiveness, although the recent changes provide some more wiggle room in certain cases:Your employer must be a government organization at any level, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization or some other type of not-for-profit organization that provides public service.Your loans must be federal Direct loansTo reach forgiveness, you need to have made 120 qualifying, on-time payments in an income-driven repayment plan or the standard repayment plan. (There are some 14 plan options to repay your student loans, but to qualify for public service loan forgiveness, you need to be enrolled in one of these four income-based repayment plans: income-contingent repayment, income-based repayment, pay-as-you-earn repayment or revised pay-as-you-earn repayment.The best way to find out if your job qualifies as public service is to fill out the so-called employer certification form.Many people think they need to fill out this form; in reality, it's optional, Kantrowitz said. (In theory, you could wait until you've made the 120 payments, then apply, ""but, it may be easier if you've been filing the employer certification forms all along, especially if one of your previous employers no longer exists,"" he said.)Try to fill out this form at least once a year, he added, and keep records of your confirmed qualifying payments. Borrowers pursuing PSLF should also know that their servicer has recently changed from FedLoan to MOHELA.In addition, all months during the pandemic-era payment pause that's been in effect since March 2020 count toward your 120 needed payments, whether or not you've been making payments on your loans.Student loan bills are scheduled to resume some 60 days after the litigation involving the Biden administration's broad student loan forgiveness plan resolves. If the lawsuits are still pending by the end of June, the payments will pick back up 60 days after that, at the end of August."

2022-12-09,"From 2010 to 2020, Americans moved into regions where climate change is making wildfires and extreme heat more common, according to an analysis from the University of Vermont published Thursday.Americans migrated to the cities and suburbs in the Pacific Northwest, parts of the Southwest (in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah), Texas, Florida, and parts of the Southeast (including Nashville, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.), according to the research.Homebuyers need to be doing their due diligence on the climate risks associated with the location where they are considering buying a new home. Over the last decade, there was an influx of Americans into regions where climate change is making wildfires and extreme heat more common, according to an analysis of multiple data sets done at the University of Vermont (UVM).Broadly speaking, Americans migrated to the cities and suburbs in the Pacific Northwest, parts of the Southwest (in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah), Texas, Florida, and parts of the Southeast (including Nashville, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.), according to the research.People moved away from the Midwest, the Great Plains, and from some of the counties that were hardest hit by hurricanes along the Mississippi River, according to the research.""Our main finding is that people seem to be moving to counties with the highest wildfire risks, and cities and suburbs with relatively hot summers. This is concerning because wildfire and heat are only expected to become more dangerous with climate change,"" Mahalia Clark, the lead author of the study, told CNBC. ""We hope our study will increase people's awareness of wildfire and other climate risks when moving or buying a house, since many people might be unaware of these dangers,"" Clark told CNBC. ""People tend to think of wildfire as something that affects the West, but it also affects large areas of the South and even Midwest.""For the research, Clark used multiple data sets, including net migration estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, the gridded surface Meteorological (gridMET) dataset hosted on the Google Earth Engine Data Catalog, and cloud cover data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The study was published on Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Human Dynamics.Making decisions about where to live may be one of the first times that the ramifications of climate change impact people's personal lives.""People also tend to think of climate change as something that will affect our grandchildren, but its effects are already being seen in the form of more frequent and severe heat waves, hurricanes, and wildfires, and it's important to take these effects into account when we plan for the future, both as individuals and as a society,"" Clark told CNBC.Deciding where to move and what home to buy is a complicated decision, and people have to weigh their own personal decisions based on job, family and culture, but Clark urges people to understand the trade-offs.""It could be that wildfire-prone areas happen to be very attractive for other reasons (strong economy, pleasant climate, dramatic scenery with opportunities for outdoor recreation), and the perceived risks of wildfire are not sufficient to outweigh these other benefits,"" Clark told CNBC. ""People moving in from out of state may also be unaware of the risks. On the other hand, sometimes high risk areas are more affordable, creating an unfortunate incentive for people to move there."" Local authorities can play a part, too, Clark said.""Development in wildfire prone areas can actually exacerbate risks, since increased human activity can spark more fires, so one implication of our work is that city planners may need to consider discouraging new development where fires are most likely or are difficult to fight,"" Clark told CNBC. ""At a minimum, policymakers should work to increase public awareness and preparedness and plan for sufficient fire prevention and response resources in high-risk areas with high population growth.""The findings out of University of Vermont are ""pretty consistent with what we've seen for the past 20 years with the two cycles of the census in terms of population growth in the Pacific Northwest"" Jesse M. Keenan, a professor of sustainable real estate at Tulane University, told CNBC.Climate change plays a role in the increased number of forest fires in the Pacific Northwest because the area is getting increasingly arid and dry.""Basically, when it heats up in the atmosphere, you pull moisture, water out of the atmosphere, and that pulls it out of the biomass. So things basically just get dry, and therefore you have more fuel,"" Keenan said.Insurance companies are wising up to this and are pricing fire risk into the Pacific Northwest in ways that they hadn't in the past, Keenan said.But homebuyers also need to be doing their due diligence on the climate risks associated with the location where they are considering buying a new home. Keenan is an advisor to a company called ClimateCheck that helps identify these kinds of risks, but real estate websites now include ""climate risk"" factors like flood factor, storm risk, drought risk, heat risk and fire risk on listing pages.These kinds of tools are helpful, but not perfect, Keenan said. Some of it comes down to common sense.""If you live where there's a fair amount of tree canopy near you, anywhere in the Pacific Northwest, you are at risk for forest fire,"" Keenan said."
2022-12-09,"  On Main Street, many business owners expect the U.S. economy to enter a recession, but more say we are not experiencing one now.That's according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, which finds more small businesses pushing out their recession forecast to next year.The CNBC|SurveyMonkey data finds that a majority of entrepreneurs say they are prepared for an economic downturn.  With just a few weeks left before the new year begins, we're no closer to solving one of the great economic debates of 2022: are we in a recession? Signals from the economy are mixed, but the answer from small business owners has changed significantly from three months ago. In the latest quarterly CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, just under half of small business owners (49%) say we're currently experiencing a recession and another 9% expect a recession to occur before the end of the year. Those numbers are down from last quarter, when 57% of small business owners said the economy was already in a recession and another 14% expected a recession to begin by the end of the year. Large-scale signs of widespread economic disruption haven't materialized and that has led Main Street to push further out in time its recession expectations: 39% now say the U.S. economy will go into a recession in 2023, up from 26% last quarter, with most expecting the recession to hit in the first half of the new year. Data from the general public shows a similar, if muted, trend: 47% say a recession will begin before the end of the year if it hasn't already arrived, down from 58% who said the same in Q3. The new survey, which polled more than 2,500 small business owners and another 11,000 adults in the general U.S. population from November 9-16, is the first to show a decline or delay in recession fears. Throughout the past few months, several polls have found a majority of the public claiming the economy was already in a recession, but given differences in the way the question is asked and various polling methodologies, it's hard to compare one poll to another and impossible to pinpoint exactly when a recession might have begun – or concluded. At least three other surveys conducted in Q3 of this year, an August 2022 NBC News poll, a September NPR/PBS NewsHour poll, and a July USA Today poll all found a majority of Americans believed the country to be in a recession at that time, though their estimates range from 50% to 68%.  Partisanship drives perceptions of a recessionThe shift in our CNBC|SurveyMonkey data is notable, given the drastic change in a short window of time, but it coincides with several economic and political events that could very well be shaping public opinion. In both Q3 and Q4, small business owners who are Republicans have been more than twice as likely as those who are Democrats to say we're currently living through a recession. In the most recent data, 58% of Republicans, 48% of independents, and 31% of Democrats who are small business owners say ""we're already in a recession."" In Q3, those numbers were 69% among Republicans, 56% among independents, and 34% among Democrats. That quarter-over-quarter drop was more significant for those who identify with the GOP than those who lean blue, which means partisanship is driving much of the negative perceptions of the economy overall. Over the same time period, gas prices fell and President Biden's approval rating rose. Economic concerns, which were predicted to swing the midterm elections in favor of a Republican ""red wave,"" were overshadowed by social concerns — especially abortion. Small businesses prepared for downturnSmall business owners are realistic about the current economic prospects. Almost no one — just 3% — rates the current state of the economy as ""excellent,"" while a full 80% describe it as ""fair"" or ""poor."" Those ratings barely budged between the third and fourth quarters of this year. More important than whether a recession is occurring — or occurred, or will occur soon – is whether small businesses are prepared. On that measure, not much has changed over the past several months, even as so much of the economic and political climate has been shaken. Most small business owners (61%) say their business is prepared to withstand a recession if one were to occur. Across all industries, business types, and business sizes, every subgroup we examined is more optimistic than pessimistic about its survival chances. That optimism on Main Street exceeds the optimism among the general public. Just 52% of individuals in the U.S. say they're personally prepared to withstand a looming recession, with women less likely than men (46% vs. 59%) and younger adults less likely than older adults to feel prepared. The technical question of whether a recession has begun is less important than the more existential one: are small businesses prepared? So far, their answer is a yes. "
2022-12-09,"Oil price settled lower in volatile trading on Friday, with both benchmarks recording their biggest weekly declines in months, as growing recession fears negated any supply woes after weak economic data from China, Europe and the United States.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled 44 cents lower at $71.02 a barrel, a new low for 2022. Brent crude settled 5 cents lower at $76.10 per barrel.""Any concerns about supply are secondary to worries about the economy,"" Mizuho analyst Robert Yawger said.Oil prices had found some support and risen more than 1% earlier in the session after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the world's biggest energy exporter could cut output in response to a price cap on its crude oil exports.However, a slightly higher-than-expected rise in U.S. producer prices in November, and news of a partial restart on the Keystone Pipeline undid those gains and pushed the benchmarks more than a dollar lower. Keystone shut earlier this week after a 14,000 barrel oil leak in Kansas.The U.S. producer prices index (PPI) rose slightly more than expected in November amid a jump in the costs of services, according to a report from the U.S. Labor Department.The increase may make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will ""step on the accelerator"" on interest rate hikes, furthering fears of a looming recession, Yawger said.Both crude benchmarks posted weekly losses of around 10% each. It was the biggest weekly decline since April for the U.S. WTI futures, and since early August for Brent.Both Yawger and Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at ICAP, warned that if U.S. crude falls below $70 per barrel, it could enter a freefall and hit the low $60s range over the upcoming sessions.The market structure for WTI contracts switched to trade in contango over the next year for the first time since Nov. 2020, with contracts for near-term delivery cheaper than one year later . Brent contracts have also switched to trade in contango over the next six months.A market in contango suggests less worry about the current supply situation due to weakened demand, and encourages traders to put barrels in storage.In China, surging COVID-19 infections will likely depress economic growth in the next few months despite some restrictions being eased, economists said.Economists polled by Reuters forecast the U.S. economy will hit a short and shallow recession in the coming year.

The index subsequently rebounded 10%, buoyed by hopes of China reopening and a pivot from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The index measures large and mid-cap stock performance across four emerging markets, one developed market and one frontier market. In total, it comprises 170 constituents across Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Fed interest rates are expected to reach 5% by May, and a U.S. recession is expected at the end of the year.But ""contrary to investors' belief, the equity market has failed to fully price in a recession until it happens,"" the report said.Trade-oriented economies like Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia will be especially affected by the slower global growth to come and weaker demand for durable consumer goods. On top of that, China's expected relaxation of Covid restrictions is unlikely to offset the forecast plunge.The Thai economy, for example, is expected to be hit by a ""significant decline"" in exports, private investments and manufacturing, with JPMorgan analysts downgrading their 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast from 3.3% to 2.7%. Singapore is also expected to face more challenging macroeconomic conditions.

But China's reopening to international travel, if it happens, would be a ""positive catalyst"" for Singapore's economy. Chinese tourists accounted for around 20% of Singapore's tourist arrivals in 2019, whose return could also ""generate knock-on impacts on [Singapore's] consumption and travel-related services sector.""Nevertheless, JPMorgan estimates that the uptick will still likely be limited by the aforementioned global recessionary conditions and external demand challenges that the country faces.A full border reopening from China would also add ""potential upside"" for Thailand's tourism recovery, and that could be inflationary, according to the report.""There is an argument that China's earlier-than-expected border reopening is inflationary,"" JPMorgan said. Nevertheless, while tourism may stimulate wage gains and consumption, it is not tightly correlated with inflation in countries like Thailand, where the nature of inflation is primarily supply-driven, the analysts added."

The Russian leader was represented by First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov at the leaders' meeting hosted by Thailand last month."
2022-12-12,"To combat stubborn inflation, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce its seventh interest rate increase of the year.Another rate hike will impact borrowing costs across the board.Here's what that means for you. The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to raise interest rates for the seventh time this year to combat stubborn inflation. The U.S. central bank will likely approve a 0.5 percentage point hike, a more typical pace compared with the super-size 75 basis point moves at each of the last four meetings.This would push benchmark borrowing rates to a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's moves still affect the rates consumers see every day. By raising rates, the Fed makes it costlier to take out a loan, causing people to borrow and spend less, effectively pumping the brakes on the economy and slowing down the pace of price increases. ""For most people this is pretty good news because prices are starting to stabilize,"" said Laura Veldkamp, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University Business School. ""That's going to bring a lot of reassurance to households.""However, ""there are some households that will be hurt by this,"" she added — particularly those with variable rate debt.For example, most credit cards come with a variable rate, which means there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark rate.But it doesn't stop there.More from Personal Finance:Just 12% of adults, and 29% of millionaires, feel 'wealthy'35% of millionaires say they won't have enough to retireInflation boosts U.S. household spending by $433 a month Another increase in the prime rate will send financing costs even higher for many other forms of consumer debt. On the flip side, higher interest rates also mean savers will earn more money on their deposits.""Credit card rates are at a record high and still increasing,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. ""Auto loan rates are at an 11-year high, home equity lines of credit are at a 15-year high, and online savings account and CD [certificate of deposit] yields haven't been this high since 2008.""Here's a breakdown of how increases in the benchmark interest rate have impacted everything from mortgages and credit cards to car loans, student debt and savings: Although 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates are fixed and tied to Treasury yields and the economy, anyone shopping for a new home has lost considerable purchasing power, partly because of inflation and the Fed's policy moves.""Though they are falling, mortgage rates are still at a more than 10-year high,"" said Jacob Channel, senior economic analyst at LendingTree.The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage currently sits at 6.33%, down from mid-November, when it peaked at 7.08%.For would-be buyers, a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage on a $300,000 loan would cost about $1,283 a month at last year's 3.11% rate. If you paid today's 6.33% instead, that would cost an extra $580 a month or $6,960 more a year and another $208,800 over the lifetime of the loan, Channel calculated.Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, and home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs, are pegged to the prime rate. As the federal funds rate rises, the prime rate does, as well, and these rates follow suit. Most ARMs adjust once a year, but a HELOC adjusts right away. Already, the average rate for a HELOC is up to 7.3% from 4.24% earlier in the year. Credit card annual percentage rates are now more than 19%, on average, up from 16.3% at the beginning of the year, according to Bankrate.""Even those with the best credit card can expect to be offered APRs of 18% and higher,"" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief credit analyst.But ""rates aren't just going up on new cards,"" he added. ""The rate you're paying on your current credit card is likely going up, too.""Further, households are increasingly leaning on credit cards to afford basic necessities since incomes have not kept pace with inflation, making it even harder for those carrying a balance from month to month.If the Fed announces a 50 basis point hike as expected, the cost of existing credit card debt will increase by an additional $3.2 billion in the next year alone, according to a new analysis by WalletHub.3. Auto loansEven though auto loans are fixed, payments are getting bigger because the price for all cars is rising along with the interest rates on new loans. So if you are planning to buy a car, you'll shell out more in the months ahead.The average interest rate on a five-year new car loan is currently 6.05%, up from 3.86% at the beginning of the year, although consumers with higher credit scores may be able to secure better loan terms.Paying an annual percentage rate of 6.05% instead of 3.86% could cost consumers roughly $5,731 more in interest over the course of a $40,000, 72-month car loan, according to data from Edmunds.Still, it's not the interest rate but the sticker price of the vehicle that's primarily causing an affordability crunch, McBride said.4. Student loansThe interest rate on federal student loans taken out for the 2022-23 academic year already rose to 4.99%, up from 3.73% last year and 2.75% in 2020-21. It won't budge until next summer: Congress sets the rate for federal student loans each May for the upcoming academic year based on the 10-year Treasury rate. That new rate goes into effect in July.Private student loans tend to have a variable rate tied to the Libor, prime or Treasury bill rates — and that means that, as the Fed raises rates, those borrowers are also paying more in interest. How much more, however, will vary with the benchmark.Currently, average private student loan fixed rates can range from 2.99% to 14.96%, and 2.99% to 14.86% for variable rates, according to Bankrate. As with auto loans, they vary widely based on your credit score.5. Savings accountsOn the upside, the interest rates on some savings accounts are also higher after consecutive rate hikes.While the Fed has no direct influence on deposit rates, the rates tend to be correlated to changes in the target federal funds rate. The savings account rates at some of the largest retail banks, which were near rock bottom during most of the Covid pandemic, are currently up to 0.24%, on average.Thanks, in part, to lower overhead expenses, top-yielding online savings account rates are as high as 4%, much higher than the average rate from a traditional, brick-and-mortar bank, according to Bankrate.""Interest rates can vary substantially, especially in today's interest rate environment in which the Fed has raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in more than a decade,"" said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com.""Banks make money off of customers who don't monitor their interest rates,"" Tumin said.With balances of $1,000 to $25,000, the difference between the lowest and highest annual percentage yield can result in an additional $51 to $965 in a year and $646 to $11,685 in 10 years, according to an analysis by DepositAccounts.Still, any money earning less than the rate of inflation loses purchasing power over time. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday outlined what needs to happen for the Federal Reserve to finally beat inflation after the monthly consumer price index report showed that prices rose less than expected in November.""Without a well-deserved crash in crypto and a sign of higher unemployment acknowledged by [Federal Reserve Chair] Jay Powell, this CPI reading has to be treated as a one-off number,"" he said.Cramer said that while the CPI data is a good sign for the Fed, the central bank needs to tamp down inflation in more areas of the economy, specifically in wages. This means that there needs to be much more wreckage in the job market, which is yet to be seen, he added.Yet another obstacle for the Fed is that speculative assets have managed to stay afloat, according to Cramer. Bitcoin jumped to its highest level in over a month on Tuesday after the cooler-than-expected CPI reading – despite the spectacle of crypto exchange FTX's collapse. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday charged former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried with misappropriating funds.""Today should have been a huge victory for Jay Powell on a speculation front because part of beating inflation is draining out the speculative juices in the economy. Yet, there's still a ton of juice left to be drained from crypto,"" Cramer said.Both high wages and the resilience in crypto suggest that the Fed still has a long way to go, he concluded.""The Fed has to start somewhere in the fight against inflation and today's a good beginning, but … [Powell's] got to crush inflation for good,"" he said.

2022-12-13,"The stock market initially soared Tuesday after a softer-than-expected report on November consumer prices gave investors hope that the worst of the decades-high inflation might be behind us.

It's the smallest monthly increase in over a year.The report marks the fifth month in a row where the rate of inflation has declined in the United States, Biden said.Biden said he hopes prices will return to normal by the end of next year, if not sooner, but stressed he cannot make that prediction. President Joe Biden on Tuesday celebrated the positive consumer price index report that showed inflation easing in the United States ahead of the holiday season.""We learned last month that the inflation rate came down, down more than experts expected,"" Biden said, speaking from the White House. ""In a world where inflation is rising in double digits in many major economies around the world, inflation is coming down in America.""The core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy costs and which economists view as a primary indicator of inflation, rose only 0.2% in November. It's the smallest monthly increase in over a year. The report released by the Labor Department on Tuesday found core CPI costs up 6% from a year ago.Overall CPI, which includes food and energy, rose 0.1% from the previous month and 7.1% over the last year.The easing suggests the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases could be working as intended and the Fed may be able to achieve the ""soft landing"" it wants, avoiding a large-scale economic recession.The report is likely to be reassuring to the Fed and the central bank's Chair Jerome Powell. When it concludes its meeting on Wednesday, the Fed is expected to only increase interest rates by a half-point — as opposed to the three-quarter point hikes it has deployed throughout the year.The report marks the fifth month in a row where the rate of inflation has declined in the United States, Biden said.""I want to be clear it's going to take time to get inflation back to normal levels as we make the transition to a more stable and steady growth,"" Biden said.Biden, standing beside Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, said he hopes prices will return to normal by the end of next year, if not sooner. But he stressed he cannot make that prediction.""I'm just convinced they're not going to go up. I'm convinced they're going to continue to go down,"" he said.The president acknowledged that many Americans are currently struggling. But he said the positive economic news confirms that his economic policies are working, and urged Americans to stay the course.""What is clear is my economic plan is working and we're just getting started,"" Biden said.

2022-12-14,"The CDC found that long Covid played a role in the deaths of 3,544 people from January 2020 through June 2022. Seniors ages 75 and older were the most heavily impacted. The CDC examined death certificates listing Covid-19 as a contributing or underlying cause and then looked closer for long Covid terms. The report may underestimate long Covid deaths because clinical guidance on how to identify the condition has changed over time. Long Covid has contributed to the deaths of more than 3,500 people since the pandemic began, according to a report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday.This is the first official U.S. estimate of how many people have died from the mysterious array of conditions that afflict people months after their initial Covid infection. Long Covid played a role in less than 1% of the more than 1 million Covid-19 deaths recorded from January 2020 through June 2022, according to the report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.CDC analysts examined death certificates from January 2020 through June 2022 that listed Covid as a contributing or underlying cause of death. The analysts then looked more closely at these death certificates to identify language indicating long Covid played a role in the death.The U.S. had not implemented an official diagnostic code for long Covid at the time of the study. As a result, the analysts chose common terms for the condition including ""chronic Covid,"" ""long Covid,"" ""long haul Covid,"" ""long hauler Covid"" and ""post Covid"" among others.The authors said the report may underestimate the true number of deaths from long Covid because clinical guidance on how to identify and report the condition has changed over time. This means the study may have missed other key terms used on death certificates that indicate long Covid played a role.Long Covid deaths peaked at 3.8% of all Covid fatalities in April 2022, according to the report. Seniors ages 75 and older accounted for about 57% of the 2,490 long Covid deaths with detailed demographic information.The death rate for long Covid was highest among American Indians and Native Alaskans at 14.8 per 100,000. Overall, most people who died from long Covid, 78.5%, were white, according to the report. Ten percent were Black and 7.8% were Hispanic.Scientists still do not fully understand what causes long Covid, and public health experts are still trying to find out exactly how many people are impacted in the U.S. There's no official medical definition of long Covid in the U.S. yet, though it generally refers to a diverse array of symptoms that can persist for months after infection.Long Covid can range widely from mild to debilitating symptoms impacting multiple organ systems that prevent people from returning to work.

The benchmark 10-year yield moved higher to 3.53%.According to Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the big issue that makes the Fed's forecast hawkish is that central bank officials now sees their rate hikes stopping at a higher level of about 5.1%, versus its forecast of 4.6% at the September meeting.Strategists also noted the Fed did not mention the better than expected consumer inflation report for November. CPI was up 7.1% on an annual basis, below expectations and well below the 7.7% in October. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, in his remarks, did give a nod to the inflation report. While he said there was a welcome reduction in the pace of inflation, he said the Fed needs substantially more evidence that inflation is being tamed. ""The fact that there was no text in the statement on the recent declines in inflation, the Fed is acknowledging inflation is much too elevated and they still have a hawkish stance,"" said Mark Cabana of Bank of America.--Patti Domm  Wed, Dec 14 20222:40 PM EST Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday the recent positive signs for inflation aren't enough for the central bank to ease back on interest rate increases.""It will take substantially more evidence to have confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward"" path, Powell said during his post-meeting news conference.The comments came as the Fed raised its benchmark rate another half percentage point and indicated at least another three-quarters of a point in hikes are coming. The decision also occurs a day after November's consumer price index reading was up just 0.1%, an indication that inflation may have peaked.However, Powell said inflation remains a problem.""Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services,"" Powell added.—Jeff Cox  Wed, Dec 14 20222:36 PM EST The updated Fed projections should be seen as a signal that the Fed will maintain high rates for an extended period of time rather than an accurate projection of where they may stop, according to Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer for Bleakley Financial Group.""Bottom line, we're now splitting hairs here on whether the fed funds rate ends up at 5-5.25% or 4.5-4.75% as previously forecasted, especially after such a dramatic rise already.

Besides boosting the terminal rate forecast above 5%, just two Fed officials in their forecast were below 5%. ""That's a hawkish surprise. It's not like it's a disperse group. I think we're seeing a delayed reaction. We need to see how Powell characterizes it.""

At that point, officials are likely to pause to allow the impact of the monetary policy tightening make its way through the economy.The consensus then pointed to a full percentage point worth of rate cuts in 2024, taking the funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year. That is followed by another percentage point of cuts in 2025 to a rate of 3.1%, before the benchmark settles into a longer-run neutral level of 2.5%.— Jeff Cox  Wed, Dec 14 20222:00 PM EST In its final meeting of 2022, the Federal Reserve hiked rates by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point.

Chair Jerome Powell is also slated to hold a news conference after the Fed's announcement, and investors will look for clues on what the central bank will do next — especially after the latest consumer price index report showed signs of inflation slowing. Additionally, the Fed is set to release it latest ""dot plot,"" which shows where central bank officials expect rates to be over the next few years. Investors will comb through that data to gauge where the so-called terminal rate — the high water mark for rates — will be. — Fred Imbert, Jeff Cox "

The firm had previously set its growth forecast for next year at 5%.""Investor positioning in China's assets is still low and this recovery is not fully priced in equity and FX markets,"" the note said, adding the revision reflects a rebound in activity predicted to come earlier than expected.""We had previously expected a rebound in activity to materialize from late 2Q23. Now we are projecting mobility to improve from early March,"" it said.The report said further easing of restrictions will likely lead to a significant rise in Covid cases, though the firm says the impact of the surge will be short-lived.— Jihye Lee  Tue, Dec 13 20229:06 PM EST The New Zealand Treasury is expecting the economy to enter a technical recession within 2023, according to its Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update report.The report predicted three consecutive quarters of contraction in 2023, slightly longer than a technical recession, which is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of declines.""While the precise timing is uncertain, our base case is that real GDP growth is forecast to slow materially through 2023, with a contraction of 0.8% over the three quarters to end 2023 before a slow, gradual recovery in 2024 and beyond,"" it said.Separately, the nation's budget statement for 2023 specified that the recession will likely be a shallow one.""The Government will carefully manage fiscal policy to take pressure off inflation, and return spending to normal levels following the emergency pandemic response,"" it said, adding that such budget proposals must be balanced with ""preparations to support Kiwis through a shallow 'speedbump' recession forecast for 2023.""The country's fiscal policy through its 2023 budget will maintain a contractionary stance, the release said.— Jihye Lee  Tue, Dec 13 20228:34 PM EST Sentiment at Japan's large manufacturers worsened in the fourth quarter, according to the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey.The headline index for large manufacturers' sentiment came in at 7, a decline from the previous quarter's reading of 8.

2022-12-15,"Retail sales for November declined 0.6%, even worse than the Dow Jones estimate for a 0.3% drop.Weekly jobless claims fell to 211,000, a decline of 20,000 from the previous period and well below the Dow Jones estimate for 232,000.Fed surveys from the New York and Philadelphia regions showed contraction in manufacturing activity in December. Consumers pulled back on spending in November, failing to keep up with even a muted level of inflation for the month, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.Retail sales for the month declined 0.6%, even worse than the Dow Jones estimate for a 0.3% drop. The number is not adjusted for inflation as gauged by the Labor Department's consumer price index, which increased 0.1% in November, which also was below expectations.Measures that exclude autos and both autos and gas sales both showed 0.2% declines.Stocks fell sharply following a mostly disappointing round of economic data released Thursday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off nearly 500 points in early trading.The pullback was widespread across categories. Furniture and home furnishings stores reported a decrease of 2.6%, building materials and garden centers were off 2.5%, and motor vehicle and parts dealers dropped 2.3%.Even with declining gas prices, service stations sales were down just 0.1%.Online sales also decreased, falling 0.9%, while bars and restaurants increased 0.9%, and food and beverage stores rose 0.8%.On a year-over-year basis, retail sales increased 6.5%, compared with a CPI inflation rate of 7.1%.""With weak global growth and the strong dollar compounding the domestic drag from higher interest rates, we suspect this weakness is a sign of things to come,"" Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote of the retail report.In other economic news Thursday, the Labor Department said weekly jobless claims fell to 211,000, a decline of 20,000 from the previous period and well below the Dow Jones estimate for 232,000. Continuing claims, which run a week behind, nudged higher to 1.671 million.Also, separate surveys from regional Federal Reserve districts showed contraction in manufacturing activity in December.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey, which measures activity in the New York region, posted a reading of -11.2, against the estimate of -0.5.That represents the percentage difference between companies reporting expansion against contraction. This month's reading represented a drop of some 16 points into contraction territory, owed in good part to a slide in the general business conditions index. Inventories in the region also fell, though price indexes were little changed.Similarly, the Philadelphia Fed survey rose 6 points but was still negative at -13.8, against the -12 estimate. Sharp negative readings for new orders, unfilled orders and delivery times weighed on the index. However, prices eased considerably for the region, with both the prices paid and received measures falling.""With exports now suffering from the strong dollar, and a global recession looming, we expect that further weakness in manufacturing lies in store,"" Hunter said."
2022-12-15,"Curtis S. Chin, a former U.S. ambassador to the Asian Development Bank, is managing director of advisory firm RiverPeak Group. Jose B. Collazo is an analyst focusing on the Indo-Pacific region. Follow them on Twitter at @CurtisSChin and @JoseBCollazo.As the new year approaches, we turn again to our annual look at Asia's winners and losers. Government and business leaders in every major economy — China now included — may well hope 2023 is the year when draconian pandemic-related lockdowns become a matter of history.In our 2021 annual review, we awarded ""worst year in Asia"" to Afghan women and girls — a consequence of the U.S. and its allies' chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the return of Taliban rule. ""Best year"" went to Asia's Cold War warriors, as social media, ""wolf warriors"" and politicians helped spark a return to Cold War rhetoric amid worsening U.S.-China relations.Now, with hopes that Covid is in retreat and that inflation will moderate in the year ahead, we take a last look at who had it good and who had it bad in 2022. Perseverance proved a winner in 2022 as the year ended with Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. of the Philippines and Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia becoming leaders of their respective countries. One salvaged a family legacy, the other moved from prison to power — storylines befitting a Netflix series.In the Philippines, Marcos — the namesake son of his authoritarian father — won a landslide election in May for president, despite what detractors see as a family legacy of corruption and impunity. More than 35 years ago, in February 1986, the senior Marcos and his wife Imelda fled to Hawaii in exile, driven out by a People Power Revolution and a loss of U.S. support. And in Malaysia, Anwar finally proved a winner in November, shedding the long-held descriptor of ""prime-minister-in-waiting"" to become his nation's 10th prime minister. That followed decades marked by smear campaigns, imprisonment and backroom intrigue as the onetime deputy prime minister challenged vested interests with his vows to combat corruption.The two now face the challenge of governing and moving their respective countries forward. Stay tuned for the next episode. In a year that saw tensions between the U.S and China reach a feverish peak when U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei, the island's sophisticated semiconductor industry ends the year in a good position. Taiwan's chipmakers are more essential than ever.  Semiconductor chips lie at the heart of everything from computers to cars to smartphones. Underscoring the Taiwanese tech industry's critical role, a Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)/Boston Consulting Group 2021 study found that 92% of the world's most advanced semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located in Taiwan. The other 8% was in South Korea.  A rare bipartisan U.S. Congress has taken notice, passing in July 2022 the CHIPS and Science Act, which allocates $52 billion in federal funding to spur further domestic production of semiconductor chips. In December, the world's dominant chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), announced plans for a second semiconductor chip plant in Arizona, raising to $40 billion what is already one of the largest foreign investments in U.S. history. With numbers like those, Taiwan's semiconductor industry ends the year on the move, still building ties and winning growing support from business and government in the United States and elsewhere. As in much of the world, investors in Asia — once bedazzled if not bewitched by the crypto industry — end the year in a mixed mood. Industry meltdowns have left many, including in government, wondering if the message of caveat emptor — buyer beware — is sufficient, and new regulations loom. The crypto exchange FTX's billions-dollar implosion set off alarm bells throughout the region. Singapore's Temasek Holdings, which has written off its entire $275 million investment in the now-collapsed FTX cryptocurrency business, has suffered ""reputational damage,"" Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said. The crypto skeptics of 2022 point to companies ranging from Terraform Labs, the Singapore-based company behind cryptocurrency TerraUSD, to the now bankrupt Singapore-based hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. The year also saw Bitfront, a crypto exchange backed by Line, one of Japan's largest social media players, close its doors.  Still, hope springs eternal that in Asia and elsewhere, a crypto spring will come as part of the ongoing embrace of a ""digital asset economy"" and ""all things fintech."" Even amid food insecurity and economic worries across much of Asia, the images of angry citizens storming the official residence of Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the Presidential Secretariat stand out in what was most decidedly a bad year for this one-time ""pearl of South Asia.""Sri Lanka continues to face a multidimensional crisis. A broken economy, depleted foreign currency reserves, high inflation — at one point reaching more than 70% — and power, fuel and food shortages made worse by the impact of the war in Ukraine, a growing ""brain drain"" and meager tourism numbers characterize this south Asian nation today. By September, nearly 200,000 Sri Lankans had left the island nation, and thousands of would-be emigrants were planning to do the same in search of a brighter future elsewhere. An IMF deal to restructure Sri Lanka's debt could provide much needed cash and economic stability, but negotiations remain complicated by large amounts of Sri Lankan debt held by China, India and Japan. While China has taken pride in an extraordinarily low number of (officially reported) Covid-related deaths, the nation has also become a showcase for the negative consequences of efforts to contain the virus. In what should have been a good year for Chinese President Xi Jinping, he has seen the year close with a wave of Chinese discontent. By year-end, anti-lockdown protests were reported in numerous cities, including at the world's largest iPhone assembly factory in Zhengzhou, as China's zero-Covid policy took its toll on the economy and everyday people's mental health. ""We want freedom, not Covid tests,"" became a common chant of some protesters, according to Reuters, as individuals ""pushed the boundaries by speaking for change in a country where space for dissent has narrowed dramatically.""The spark that set off the rare protests was news of the deaths of 10 people, including several children, in an apartment building fire in Urumqi in China's Xinjiang province — in an area that had been locked down for several months. A storyline on social media that resonated across the country focused on the role that Covid controls might have played in those deaths.Chinese citizens can take heart that those protests may well have had an impact. The Chinese government has begun to relax zero-Covid restrictions. Still, the nation continues to lag the world in opening and moving forward, and worries continue about the nation's rate of vaccination among the elderly.And so, even as hope has returned for a better year ahead, China's beleaguered, locked-down citizens take the dubious honors of worst year in Asia 2022."
2022-12-15,"The 10-year Treasury yield fell Thursday, as markets digested a disappointing retail sales report that added to concerns the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hiking campaign could lead to a recession. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down by 5 basis points at 3.452%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped nearly 4 basis points at 3.503%. The 2-year yield declined about 2 basis points at 4.232%. Yields move inversely to prices.Retail sales came in weaker than expected, falling 0.6% in November, according to the Commerce Department. That was below Dow Jones estimates of a 0.3% decline.The Fed's hike on Wednesday marked a slowdown from the previous four increases of 75 basis points. The central bank indicated that rates will remain higher throughout 2023, with cuts unlikely until 2024. It also projected that the ""terminal rate"" will rise to 5.1% before the end of the hiking cycle.""The Fed remains willing to risk a recession in the labor market in order to bring inflation down and, if anything, the December projections suggest that risk has risen, not diminished.

That's according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese. BEIJING — Mainland China's swift rollback of many Covid-related restrictions has been unexpectedly sudden, revealing a new set of economic challenges.In the last two weeks, local and central government authorities relaxed several measures that had forced many people to stay home and businesses to operate mostly remotely. Notably, the central government said last week negative virus tests and health code checks were no longer needed to travel domestically.Meanwhile, reports of locals falling ill have surged. Beijing city said that on Sunday, its fever clinics saw 22,000 visits — up 16 times from a week ago.""This reopening has come rather suddenly, and rather resolutely. It's exceeded our expectations,"" said Gang Yu, co-founder and executive chairman of 111, an online seller of medicines and health-care services. That's according to a CNBC translation of his comments in Mandarin. Since late November, orders for fever-reducing products and related medicines have surged tenfold, Yu said in a phone interview Thursday. He said there's an ""extraordinary shortage"" of medicines that factories can't keep up with, a situation he expects will last for at least another three or four weeks.On top of the high demand, tens of workers at 111's warehouses or offices in different parts of China have tested positive for Covid, creating an ""extraordinary shortage"" of staff, Yu said.That's a different challenge from earlier this year, when widespread Covid lockdowns meant thousands of new orders were getting stranded at different distribution points each day, Yu said. Delivery is still slower than normal in parts of the country.Even as of Sunday, China's postal agency said more than 400 distribution points in Beijing and other parts of the country remained closed for Covid-related reasons.For a sense of scale, the postal service said Tuesday it was collecting more than 360 million parcels a day — that's more than one package per person in the U.S. JD.com announced Wednesday that more than 1,000 couriers from other parts of the country had arrived in the capital city of Beijing. Anecdotally, in the last few days in Beijing, app-based food and grocery services that typically deliver within an hour were only doing so at far longer intervals, or a next-day basis. ""Over the past two weeks, the Chinese government did a sudden 180-degree turn on ending its zero Covid policies, with most of the domestic prevention measures completely ditched,“ Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu and a team said in a report Thursday.“Surging Covid infections may offset the positive impact of the easing in the near term.""""The rapid surge of infections in big cities might be only the beginning of a massive wave of Covid infections,"" the analysts said.""We expect major activity indices to remain weak or even to drop further in December. We reckon that the incoming migration around the Chinese New Year holiday in late January could bring about an unprecedented spread of Covid and severe disruptions to the economy.""China reported Thursday a worse-than-expected drop in retail sales in November, as well as slower growth in industrial production and fixed asset investment.

2022-12-16,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that despite recent indications that inflation may have peaked, the fight to wrestle it back to manageable levels is far from over.On Thursday, the European Central Bank followed suit, also opting for a smaller hike but suggesting it would need to raise rates ""significantly"" further to tame inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank all raised interest rates by 50 basis points this week, in line with expectations, but markets are honing in on their shifting tones.Markets reacted negatively after the Fed on Wednesday hiked its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to its highest level in 15 years. This marked a slowdown from the previous four meetings, at which the central bank implemented 75 basis point hikes.However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that despite recent indications that inflation may have peaked, the fight to wrestle it back to manageable levels is far from over.""There's an expectation really that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so we'll have to stay at it,"" Powell said in Wednesday's press conference.""We may have to raise rates higher to get where we want to go.""On Thursday, the European Central Bank followed suit, also opting for a smaller hike but suggesting it would need to raise rates ""significantly"" further to tame inflation.The Bank of England also implemented a half-point hike, adding that it would ""respond forcefully"" if inflationary pressures begin to look more persistent. George Saravelos, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said the major central banks had given the markets a ""clear message"" that ""financial conditions need to stay tight.""""We wrote at the start of 2022 that the year was all about one thing: rising real rates. Now that central banks have achieved this, the 2023 theme is different: preventing the market from doing the opposite,"" Saravelos said.""Buying risky assets on the premise of weak inflation is a contradiction in terms: the easing in financial conditions that it entails undermines the very argument of weakening inflation.""Within that context, Saravelos said, the ECB and the Fed's explicit shift in focus from the consumer price index (CPI) to the labor market is notable, as it implies that supply-side movements in goods are not sufficient to declare ""mission accomplished.""""The overall message for 2023 seems clear: central banks will push back on higher risky assets until the labour market starts to turn,"" Saravelos concluded.Economic outlook tweaksThe hawkish messaging from the Fed and the ECB surprised the market somewhat, even though the policy decisions themselves were in line with expectations.Berenberg on Friday adjusted its terminal rate forecasts in accordance with the developments of the last 48 hours, adding an additional 25 basis point rate hike for the Fed in 2023, taking the peak to a range between 5% and 5.25% over the course of the first three meetings of the year.""We still think that a decline in inflation to c3% and a rise in unemployment to well above 4.5% by the end of 2023 will eventually trigger a pivot to a less restrictive stance, but for now, the Fed clearly intends to go higher,"" Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding said. The bank also upped its projections for the ECB, which it now sees raising rates to ""restrictive levels"" at a steady pace for more than one meeting to come. Berenberg added a further 50 basis point move on March 16 to its existing anticipation of 50 basis points on Feb. 2. This takes the ECB's main refinancing rate to 3.5%.""From such a high level, however, the ECB will likely need to reduce rates again once inflation has fallen to close to 2% in 2024,"" Schmieding said.""We now look for two cuts of 25bp each in mid-2024, leaving our call for the ECB main refi rate at end-2024 unchanged at 3.0%.""The Bank of England was slightly more dovish than the Fed and the ECB and future decisions will likely be heavily dependent on how the expected U.K. recession unfolds. However, the Monetary Policy Committee has repeatedly flagged caution over labor market tightness.Berenberg expects an additional 25 basis point hike in February to take the bank rate to a peak of 3.75%, with 50 basis points of cuts in the second half of 2023 and a further 25 basis points by the end of 2024.""But against a backdrop of positive surprises in recent economic data, the extra 25bp rate hikes from the Fed and the BoE do not make a material difference to our economic outlook,"" Schmieding explained. ""We still expect the U.S. economy to contract by 0.1% in 2023 followed by 1.2% growth in 2024 whereas the U.K. will likely suffer a recession with a 1.1% drop in GDP in 2023 followed by a 1.8% rebound in 2024.""For the ECB, though, Berenberg does see the extra 50 basis points expected from the ECB to have a visible impact, restraining growth most evidently in late 2023 and early 2024.""While we leave our real GDP call for next year unchanged at -0.3%, we lower our call for the pace of economic recovery in 2024 from 2.0% to 1.8%,"" Schmieding said.He noted, however, that over the course of 2022, central banks' forward guidance and shifts in tone have not proven themselves to be a reliable guide to future policy action.""We see the risks to our new forecasts for the Fed and the BoE as balanced both ways, but as the winter recession in the euro zone will likely be deeper than the ECB projects, and as inflation will probably fall substantially from March onwards, we see a good chance that the ECB's final rate increase in March 2023 will be by 25bp rather than 50bp,"" he said."
2022-12-16,"The 10-year Treasury yield rose as investors considered what is next for the U.S. economy.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up about 4 basis points at 3.49%, after climbing back above the 3.5% level earlier in the day. The 2-year Treasury yield last fell about 5 basis points at 4.193%.Yields and prices have an inverted relationship. One basis point equals 0.01%. Investors mulled over the outlook for the U.S. economy after retail sales figures for November came in weaker than expected on Thursday. Fears about a looming recession related to the Fed's aggressive rate hikes throughout 2022 have mounted in recent weeks.On Wednesday, the central bank had announced a 50 basis point increase to interest rates, a slight decline from the 75 basis point hikes implemented at the previous four Fed meetings.The central bank also indicated that rates would stay elevated for longer, with Chairman Jerome Powell reiterating that the battle against inflation must be continued."

2022-12-19,"Amazon shares have given up all of their gains from the pandemic.The company's stock skyrocketed in 2020 and held up in 2021 as shoppers flocked to the e-retailer for goods.Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has been battered this year by a broader market sell-off tied to soaring inflation, a worsening economy and rising interest rates. Amazon's stock price has lost all of its pandemic-fueled gains, falling back to where it was trading when Covid-19 started shutting down the U.S. economy.On Monday, the e-retailer's shares dropped 3.4% to $84.92, the lowest close since March 16, 2020.Amazon has fallen sharply this year amid a broader tech sell-off tied to soaring inflation, a worsening economy and rising interest rates. For the first time in nearly two decades, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is set to lose to the S&P 500 in consecutive years. Trillions of dollars have been wiped from tech stocks.Shares of Amazon have tumbled 49% in 2022 and are on pace for their worst year since the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value. Among the highest-valued tech companies, Meta has had the worst year, down 66%, followed by Tesla at 57% and then Amazon.It's a marked reversal from 2020, when Amazon stock rallied amid unprecedented online demand. Amazon saw a rush of orders from consumers at the height of the pandemic, as many avoided trips to physical stores and turned to the web for essential and nonessential goods.Last year, the story began to change, as e-commerce companies reckoned with tough year-over-year comparisons and the economy started to reopen, leading many people to return to physical stores. By early 2022, higher costs tied to inflation, supply chain constraints and the war in Ukraine generated further pressure on Amazon and other tech companies.For Amazon, the challenges go deeper. It's also contending with slowing growth in its core retail business, and the company has been forced to scale back after its historic expansion during the pandemic. CEO Andy Jassy has embarked on a wide-ranging review of the company's expenses, resulting in some programs being shuttered and a hiring freeze across its corporate workforce. Last month, the company began laying off thousands of employees as part of a wave of job cuts that are expected to extend into next year.The pain isn't likely to let up soon. Amazon spooked investors in October when it projected sales between $140 billion and $148 billion for the current quarter, representing growth of just 2% to 8%. That was far below analysts' average forecast of $155.15 billion, according to Refinitiv.WATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on shifting consumer spending habits"
2022-12-19,"— This is the script of CNBC's financial news report for China's CCTV on December 19, 2022.As many people watched the World Cup final in the early hours of the morning, what kind of economic impact does winning the tournament have on the country that wins it? It has been found that countries that win the World Cup tend to benefit from a boost in their economies following the event, according to recent research by Marco Mello, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Surrey.Mello's study examined data from 1961 through the present and found that countries winning the World Cup tend to gain an additional 0.25 percentage points of economic growth in the two quarters following the tournament.An improved export growth and an improved trade balance may account for this effect, which may result in a greater international appeal for the country after winning the most prestigious football competition. Brazil is a typical example. Brazil's exports increased following its victory at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.Before the final began, Mello stated that Argentina would benefit more from winning the title than France. A reason for this may be that Argentina has a more similar image as an exporter to Brazil, and another may be that France is the previous champion, and if it successfully defends its title, it will not have as much of a surprise and thus will not have a significant impact on exports.The winning country's economic problems can, however, limit the benefits derived from a World Cup victory. As an example, Spain, in 2010, faced a sovereign debt crisis, a cost-of-living crisis, and a possible recession, all of which overshadowed Spain's World Cup victory.Currently, Argentina is experiencing a difficult economic situation. November's inflation figures for Argentina were as high as 92.4% from a year earlier, the highest increase in 30 years, and according to an expectation survey released by Argentina's central bank, its annual inflation will reach 99% in 2022. Further, Argentina has also suffered from a drought, which may result in a reduction in crop exports next year.Mello's study also found that being the host country of the FIFA World Cup does not bring any significant economic benefit, at least in the short and medium term. In an interview with CNBC, Andrew Zimbalist, Professor of Economics at Smith College, also discussed the impact of the World Cup on Qatar. Qatar's large investment in this year's World Cup may enable it to enhance its soft power in the Middle East world, but some negative news has still adversely affected its reputation outside the Middle East.Andrew ZimbalistSmith College, Professor of Economics""I think they did well, in terms of Middle East standards. I don't think they did well, in terms of the non Muslim world, though. There's just a tremendous amount of negative news.""It's not just the World Cup. He also points out that the Olympics are also difficult for host countries to benefit from as an expert on the economic impact of sporting events.Andrew ZimbalistSmith College, Professor of Economics""If you look at some of the Olympic games over the last 20 or 30 years, it's very hard, I think, to make the claim that countries have benefited economically or politically from hosting.""Considering the current economic situation in Argentina, it remains to be seen whether Mello's conclusion regarding the ""World Cup effect"" will hold true for Argentina. What will happen to Qatar's economy after the World Cup? We will also keep a close eye on it for you."

It's been another rough year for China's tech stocks. Billions have been wiped off the value of the country's internet giants including Alibaba and Tencent and companies have posted their slowest growth rates on record.A Covid resurgence in China, which the government countered with its strict ""zero-Covid"" policy of swift and harsh lockdowns in major cities, has hurt the world's second-largest economy. Chinese internet firms have seen a slowdown as consumer spending was hit and advertising dollars were cut back.related investing newsHere's what to expect when Club apparel retailers TJX and Foot Locker report this weekPaulina Likosa day agoInvestors are treading with caution into next year with regard to Chinese tech stocks and analysts are broadly expecting regulation to be more predictable and growth to accelerate. But uncertainty around China's economic outlook is creating risks.Still, signs that China could be thinking about opening its economy again have given investors hope of a turnaround.""We are positive on 2023 internet sector outlook in light of reopening story and improving consumer sentiment,"" analysts at investment bank Jefferies said in a research note last month. Since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, China has adopted the so-called zero-Covid policy which attempts to use strict lockdowns and mass testing to control the virus outbreak. But that policy has weighed on the economy and taken a toll on businesses.Internet giants Tencent and Alibaba posted their slowest revenue growth rates on record in 2022, while electric vehicle makers like Xpeng saw lackluster sales as consumer sentiment took a hit.But there are signs that China's Covid policy may be reversing. This month, Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is less severe than previous versions, a shift in tone from the government ahead of announcements on relaxing Covid control measures.On Dec. 7, Chinese authorities formalized a slew of easing measures which included allowing some people infected with Covid to isolate at home rather than at government facilities, and removing the need for a virus test for those travelling across the country. How the exit from zero-Covid is handled could ultimately determine the extent of the rebound for China tech.""I will argue the prospect of a tech rebound next year depends primarily on the extent to which macroeconomy and especially consumption could recover,"" Xin Sun, senior lecturer in Chinese and East Asian business at King's College London, told CNBC via email.""Given the current extremely suppressed level of consumption, largely due to COVID restrictions and also the lack of confidence among consumers, a tech rebound is indeed likely if China could smoothly exit from zero-COVID and reopen the economy."" Analysts broadly see growth for Chinese tech names reaccelerating in 2023 as the Chinese economy prepares to reopen — but growth won't likely be on levels seen in the past, where quarterly revenue jumped 30% to 40%.Alibaba is forecast to see a 2% year-on-year jump in revenue in the fourth quarter of this year, before accelerating to just over 6% in the March quarter of 2023 and 12% in the June quarter, according to analysts' consensus estimates from Refinitiv.

That could benefit companies like e-commerce giant Alibaba and rival JD.com.Analysts at the investment bank said they expect online advertising industry growth to rebound in 2023 but warned that growth will be ""highly dependent on macro environment."" China's strict Covid policy was a major headwind for its tech sector this year, but investors were already spooked since late 2020 when Beijing ramped up regulatory tightening.The regulatory crackdown has been a big factor in giants posting slower growth rates and has hammered their stocks.Since the start of 2021, the Hang Seng tech index in Hong Kong, which includes most of China's tech giants, has fallen more than 50%.Over the past two years, Beijing has introduced a range of policies from new antiturst rules to data protection laws and an unprecedented law governing the use of algorithms by tech companies. Firms that fell foul of antitrust rules were punished with large fines, including Alibaba and food delivery company Meituan, as Beijing moved to reign in the power of its internet giants which had, until recently, grown largely unencumbered.The gaming sector has been badly hit. In 2021, regulators froze approvals for the release of new video games and brought in rules that capped the amount of time kids under the age of 18 could play online.The rules spooked investors who were largely caught unaware by China's regulatory assault on its tech sector.However, there are signs that some of the regulatory pressure may be easing. Regulators restarted the approval of games this year, which will benefit Tencent and NetEase, China's two biggest online gaming companies. The government has also on multiple occasions this year pledged to support the technology sector.""Beijing's top priority this year is economic growth. The crackdown-style governance is over because Beijing has recognized that it's a bad idea to spook markets and undermine business confidence,"" Linghao Bao, analyst at Trivium China, told CNBC.""We've already seen some recent attempts to relax Covid measures and rescue the property markets. That said, regulations will be here to stay. That means the focus has shifted toward a more measured, predictable approach to regulating big tech."" From diversification to selling off stakes in other businesses, the impact of regulation and a slowing economy is changing the way Chinese technology giants are running their companies.Firstly, Chinese tech firms have been cutting costs and exiting non-core businesses in order to boost profitability.In addition to running China's most popular messaging service WeChat, Tencent is also a prolific investor in other firms.But the company has recently started divesting stakes in some of China's biggest companies. As scrutiny on the tech sector increased, Tencent sold off stakes in some investees including JD.com and Meituan.Tencent is also focusing on other areas including it fledgling cloud computing business and an international push as gaming sales, one of its biggest drivers of revenue, remains under pressure. Alibaba, whose China retail business makes up the bulk of its revenue, is trying to ramp up sales from areas such as cloud computing to diversify its business.Beijing has also looked to separate some financially-linked businesses related to tech firms.Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba, was ordered in 2021 by China's central bank to become a financial holding company after its initial public offering was pulled in November 2020. Tencent said earlier this year that it is exploring whether regulations will require its WeChat Pay mobile payments service to also fall under a separate financial holding company.""The crackdowns have fundamentally changed the business logic these firms need to follow ... in the past Chinese tech giants strived to build the so-called 'ecosystem', which, by aggressively acquiring and integrating different lines of business, increased customer stickiness and engagement,"" said Sun from King's College.""Now they have to scale back to focus on their main business lines and seek revenue growth from optimised operation and innovation."" While some investors have reasons to be optimistic about China's tech industry next year, they are certainly treading with caution.Uncertainty about the path of China's exit from its zero-Covid policy and the trajectory of the economy in 2023. Several investment banks have cut their China economic growth forecasts over the past few months amid a slump in exports and a drag from the real estate sector, two important drivers of growth in the world's second-largest economy. ""In my view, the biggest challenge faced by tech firms next year is probably still COVID and, as a result, the weak and uncertain economic outlook,"" Sun said.Tariq Dennison, wealth manager at Hong Kong-based GFM Asset Management, told CNBC there are also a number of geopolitical risks including American investors being blocked from buying Chinese tech stocks to companies being nationalized.However, he clarified that these risks are present but unlikely.""I don't think many of those scenarios are that likely,"" he said, adding that geopolitical risks are the ""biggest collective threat."" A number of analysts and investors told CNBC over the last few months that the plunge in Chinese technology stocks has left some of them looking ""cheap"" or undervalued.That's because stock prices have fallen faster than what analysts believe could be the earnings potential for some of these Chinese technology companies.""I'm more bullish than I was 6 months ago simply because I think the prices have fallen much further than future earnings estimates have had to be revised downward,"" Dennison said.

Analysts have an average price target of 386.91 Hong Kong dollars on Tencent's stock, or about 20% upside from the Monday close of HK$320.40."
2022-12-20,"Last week, the Federal Reserve announced a 0.50 percentage point interest rate increase, bringing the target range to 4.25% to 4.5%.The move was the latest in a series of boosts to rates meant to curb inflation. But while rate hikes will ideally get inflation under control, they could also slow the economy to the point that it tips into recession.The good news: looking into next year, many experts believe the Fed can avoid a recession. ""We believe there's a very good chance of at least a 'soft-ish' landing happening,"" says Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.  Here's what market experts say that could mean for the economy and your portfolio. A ""soft landing"" would mean averting a recession, which is loosely defined as a sustained period of economic decline and typically characterized by steep job losses, high unemployment and widespread financial hardship.For now, that looks avoidable in 2023, says Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. ""We don't see a recession. When we look at consumers, whose spending makes up about 70% of [gross domestic product], they're still extremely strong and healthy.""The labor market remains strong as well, with a miniscule 3.7% unemployment rate. While a slowing economy could theoretically force businesses to lay off workers, firms are currently posting a wealth of openings, Hooper says.""The idea that unemployment has to go up by X amount for inflation to come down is overly simplistic,"" she says. ""If you were to see companies focus on slashing job openings rather than jobs, you could achieve the same result without a significant rise in unemployment.""There are also indications that inflation is slowing and the dollar is weakening, both signs that the Fed's regime is, broadly, working.But that doesn't mean the economy is out of the proverbial woods. While year-over-year inflation was lower in November than it was in October, it was still high at 7.1%.Inflated prices combined with more expensive borrowing could eventually put consumers in a bind, says Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.""It's pretty clear the general expectation is the economy has to have a massive slowdown for inflation to come back into balance,"" he says. ""Consumers are starting to tap into credit and savings, which isn't surprising."" Should inflation to continue to force consumers into racking up debt, it's only a matter of time before recession strikes, he adds.Roach believes a recession will materialize in 2023, but because of the economy's other areas of strength, he doesn't expect things to be too bad for too long.""I don't think [the economic decline] would be as deep as if we had, say, a fundamentally flawed credit market,"" Roach says. ""The average recession lasts 10 months. I think it will be shorter than average. Short and shallow is my expectation."" Overall, the Fed planning to ease interest rate hikes should come as good news to investors — even relatively pessimistic ones. ""Once the Fed stops tightening, and moves to a watch and wait policy, we know that markets respond favorably to those conditions,"" says Roach. ""2023 could be a fairly decent year for capital markets.""History also bodes well for stocks coming out of a tough year. ""The S&P 500 is rarely down two years in a row,"" says Detrick. ""If you think the economy could avoid a recession, there could be a good sized snapback in stocks.""If there is an uptick in stock prices, a few types of investments in particular would tend to benefit, investing pros say.Mutual funds and hedge funds, which account for $4.8 trillion, are taking bigger-than-average positions in companies that stand to benefit from avoiding a hard landing, say analysts at Goldman Sachs.Those include firms in the industrial, materials and energy sectors, which all tend to be sensitive to economic swings. These types of stock sectors, known as ""cyclicals,"" ""are likely to perform better in the early stages of a new bull market,"" says Hooper.Other potential beneficiaries of a soft landing: emerging markets stocks, which Hooper says should reap an outsize benefit from a weakening U.S. dollar, and small and midsize company stocks, which ""are likely to be more attractive than large-cap firms.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: 60% of Americans see crypto investing as highly risky—but millennials are still its biggest fans"

Job openings continue to outstrip the number of workers available to fill them, layoffs remain historically low and the latest unemployment rate is hovering at a healthy 3.7%, close to where it was at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. While no job is completely immune to economic headwinds, certain roles are posed to fare better than others during a potential economic downturn in 2023, according to a new report from Payscale.Here are 10 of the most ""recession-proof"" occupations that offer strong job security during economic downturns, per Payscale's research:   To determine the ranking, Payscale looked at salary data for more than 1.1 million U.S. workers on its website posted between October 2021 and October 2022, as well as the hiring and quit rates for dozens of occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These jobs can be considered ""recession-proof"" primarily because of their double-digit wage growth over the last 12 months, says Lexi Clarke, vice president of people at Payscale. Some positions are earning up to 30% more than last year. Companies are spending more to fill these roles due to labor scarcity and increased competition, Clarke says. She expects these jobs will ""continue to be high-demand"" even if a recession occurs in 2023.The list includes a mix of essential service jobs and office roles still reeling from the aftermath of the pandemic, with waiter/waitress claiming the top spot. This is because restaurants are still struggling to regenerate their workforce, Clarke says. A lack of labor supply has driven up wages for servers. Other positions, including dock workers and emergency dispatchers, are also in high demand as it has been tougher to attract and retain people for these jobs, the report says. Yet the services they provide are essential even during a downturn. Even though these jobs might be as close to a sure thing as you can expect in a volatile market, if you're thinking of switching jobs soon, you should exercise extreme caution in your search, Peter C. Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, warns. ""Do not leave, or take, a job unless you're absolutely sure you have something secure waiting for you on the other side,"" he says.

2022-12-21,"Remote workers are the most likely in the U.S. labor force to worry about being laid off and struggling to find a new job quickly, according to a CNBC|Momentive Workforce Survey.The tech industry, where layoffs have been concentrated, is part of the data story, due to its broader embrace of remote work relative to other industries.But remote workers across sectors of the economy are expressing this employment fear at an elevated rate. For the majority of workers, even in a slowing economy with recession headlines published on a daily basis and stocks in a bear market, layoffs remain in the abstract.Fifty-nine percent of American workers are not concerned they or someone in their household will lose a job in the next few months, according to a new survey of the labor force from CNBC and Momentive. And even more (80%) are confident they would find a new job in six months or less if they lost one today.This worker confidence makes sense in a labor market still running exceptionally hot, but there are some notable exceptions, starting with the niche of workers that have been the envy of the rest of the working world during Covid.Remote workers are less confident in their ability to find a new job quickly, according to the CNBC|Momentive Workforce Survey for Q4 2022. Specifically, 24% of those working remotely say they could find a new job in one month if they lost their current job, versus 41% of fully in-office workers who say the same. And 24% of those working remotely say it could take more than six months to find a new job, versus 16% of fully in-office workers. ""Remote workers are the most fearful of layoffs, because they know they have had a sweet deal: they may have suffered through the early dysfunction of Covid, but they've since reaped the benefits and relative autonomy created by working from home. That power dynamic will naturally swing back to employers if the economy weakens,"" said Laura Wronski, senior manager of research science at Momentive.Momentive conducted the survey for CNBC from Nov. 28-Dec. 5 among more than 10,000 American workers.Overall, the survey finds worker morale higher now than at any point in the past three years. Nearly three-quarters of workers (72%) say morale is ""excellent"" or ""good"" at their workplace right now, up from 64% year over year. Morale is even higher for younger workers, but according to Momentive ""morale is up among nearly all workers regardless of gender, race or job level."" Recent job market data shows a level of open positions that even if down from a peak remained above 10 million in the latest government data. And workers are demanding more money than ever before to move to a new job, according to New York Fed data released this week.""Businesses have been loathe to resort to layoffs since the very early days of the pandemic,"" Wronski said. ""If you have a job where you are able to work remotely some or all of the time, you have it pretty good right now — but it might not last. If the economy shows signs of further weakness, the flexibility and perks that many workers have grown accustomed to over the past few years will likely dissipate.""How traditional job security fears are rising — in two chartsWhen it comes to layoffs, certain long-time labor market fears are holding true, even at lower levels.Workers in food & beverage (45%) and transportation (45%), sectors where turnover is historically high and jobs are often lower-paying and where seasonal work related to the holidays is more common — are even more concerned than tech workers (44%) about their job security.Income level is a big factor in rising fear about layoffs. Race and ethnicity continue to play a significant role in job security sentiment, too. But it's as notable, albeit not surprising in the current economy, that the high-paying tech sector is right there with food & beverage and transportation, with almost half of its workers worried about losing their jobs.Tech layoffs and work-from-home job security fearsThe role of tech sector workers in the negative workforce sentiment reading is significant.Layoffs and quit rates are still very low relative to history, and compared to the recession of 2008-2009, layoffs are way below that level, said Lightcast senior economy Layla O'Kane. The labor economy research firm expects layoffs to remain low through the next quarter.""Until we start to see job opening rates come down more, [workers] won't have to be concerned about layoffs,"" O'Kane said.Even in food and beverage, she said, though a high turnover industry, the level of job openings remains high and there has been a lot of wage growth over the past year.That brought her back to tech workers as a key to this remote work story. ""People working remotely are more likely to be in technology, while people working in person are more likely to be in hospitality or health care,"" O'Kane said. ""People who are working remotely are more likely to be in industries facing layoffs.""She also noted that for professional services workers, it can take longer to find a job because they often have more savings and are able to take their time in moving to a new position. Remote positions are more likely to be offered in jobs that require a Bachelor's degree and the growth in remote work is heavily in college-degree occupations.There are logical reasons for remote workers to worry more, too. They may have moved to places where there are less, if any, positions available. And they may fear less employers on the open market are offering the same work flexibility as their current job. They may also fear being far away from a headquarters will make them more likely to be higher up on a layoffs planning doc.But looking at another key factor where professional fears have been linked to remote work, the survey finds the broader workforce more concerned than remote workers themselves: that's on the issue of career advancement. The workforce as a whole expects in-person workers to have better career advancement opportunities (53%); few think remote workers will fare the best (14%). But among remote workers themselves, these fears are not elevated. Just about half of ""mostly"" remote workers (49%) and exactly half of fully remote worker says opportunities for advancement are equal regardless of work location. Less than one-third of mostly remote workers (29%) and even fewer fully remote workers (22%) say in-person workers will have better career opportunities. Lightcast says the data on remote work opportunities remains positive, with no weakening in the overall remote work marketplace. As of November 2022, the three-month rolling average of the share of jobs postings allowing for remote work was 15.8% for occupations that require a college degree and 4.9% for those that do not require a college degree. This is likely to undercount the actual number of jobs that would allow for remote work since employers are committing up-front in the posting to remote work (rather than discussing it as part of the interview process).""By and large we continue to see remote work opportunities stabilize and grow,"" O'Kane said.But the CNBC|Momentive data shows that the tech worker influence, while notable in the remote work trend, is a subset of a larger phenomenon.Tech workers are less likely than other workers to think it would take them less than one month to find a new job (27% vs. 37%, respectively). Tech workers who work remotely are less likely than tech workers who work in-person to think they could find another job within one month (20% vs. 35%, respectively).But the same is true among non-tech workers who are remote: 27% versus 39% of non-tech workers in-person who say they could find another job within a month. This data also shows that tech workers who work remotely are less likely than non-tech workers who work remotely to think they can get another job within a month if they lost theirs.""The layoffs in tech are clearly affecting the sentiment among tech workers, driving up fears that they wouldn't be able to find another job in a short time frame if they were laid off. Remote tech workers are more fearful than in-person tech workers, just like remote workers overall are more fearful than in-person workers,"" Wronski said.It's a notable negative tech effort, but doesn't change the story much. And the story the data is telling about the latest remote work trend is: the less a person works in-office, the more likely they are to say it'll take longer to find a new job if they lose theirs. To join the CNBC Workforce Executive Council, apply at cnbccouncils.com/wec.This story has been updated to add a survey response on career advancement opportunities among in-person and remote workers."
2022-12-21,"Howell said that many corporations, particularly high growth companies, are in ""pretty decent shape.""He suggested that a central bank shift in 2023 was likely to have an effect on markets, but policymakers would pivot on liquidity before they turn dovish on interest rates. LONDON — As fundamentals hold up and tight financial conditions weigh on stock markets, corporate debt and gold could be strong investment options in 2023, according to Michael Howell, managing director at CrossBorder Capital.A slowing economy, tightening financial conditions and rising yields might typically prompt greater stress in the corporate debt markets and a higher rate of delinquencies. But corporations have so far managed to refinance with comparative ease through the current cycle.Howell acknowledged that things may get slightly more difficult for some areas of the market, but said that many corporations, particularly high growth companies, are in ""pretty decent shape.""""Balance sheets are good, so far revenues seem to be holding up, and they [companies] can access borrowing from the banks,"" Howell said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""""If you go back to 2008, remember the banks' financing tap turned off very quickly, and that was where there was a real problem. So, this time, corporate debt markets are actually in a reasonably good shape, so that is an area that I would suggest is not a bad area for 2023."" Market participants have in recent months been on the lookout for a ""pivot"" from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks, after a year of aggressive interest rate hikes to combat sky-high inflation.Howell said a potential such pivot in 2023 would likely impact markets. He suggested central banks will move to provide greater liquidity to markets and protect against the downside risk of a weakening economy before they will give up their hawkish stance on interest rates. He drew a comparison with the U.S. economic recession of March-November 2001, when the Fed began cutting rates early in the year.""The economy didn't turn until the end of 2001...the corporate debt market picked up prior to that, around about Q2, Q3 [second, third quarter] of 2001. Equity markets, I'd say it was much more of a 2002 event. The government bond markets did pretty much nothing through the year, they probably delivered maybe a decent mid-single figure return,"" Howell explained.""Where you want to be positioned next year is good quality corporate debt and gold.""At face value, expectations of additional liquidity from central banks in 2023 seem at odds with the hawkish signals sent in recent weeks by the Fed and the European Central Bank. This messaging surprised markets and added pressure on stocks and other risk assets. Howell argued that, while the ECB may be the last to do so, the Fed and the People's Bank of China (PBoC) have already begun introducing liquidity.""The PBoC is already putting in more liquidity than they have done in 18 months — this is a clear turnaround. China needs to boost the economy and the People's Bank is the way to do that,"" he said.""The Federal Reserve is adding liquidity. You've got oil prices which are below $80 a barrel — that will release liquidity into the system. The dollar is down almost 10% from its peak — that will boost the FX swap market, which is a key area of shadow banking. So all these things are beginning to pick up.""Howell stressed that the market is currently at ""maximum tightness"" and that its liquidity position can only improve in 2023 — but that this does not mean a ""green light for equities just yet."""

Facebook parent Meta has agreed to pay $725 million to settle a class action lawsuit that claimed the social media giant gave third parties access to user data without their consent.It is the ""largest recovery ever achieved in a data privacy class action and the most Facebook has ever paid to resolve a private class action,"" Keller Rohrback L.L.P, the law firm representing the plaintiffs, said in a court filing late Thursday announcing the settlement.The class action lawsuit was prompted in 2018 after Facebook disclosed that the information of 87 million users was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, a consultancy firm linked to former President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.The case was broadened to focus on Facebook's overall data-sharing practices. Plaintiffs alleged that Facebook ""granted numerous third parties access to their Facebook content and information without their consent, and that Facebook failed to adequately monitor the third parties' access to, and use of, that information,"" according to the law firm behind the lawsuit.Judges overseeing the case in the Northern District of California will now have to approve the settlement.""We pursued a settlement as it's in the best interest of our community and shareholders. Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy program,"" a Meta spokesperson told CNBC. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The Cambridge Analytica scandal prompted global outrage and a flurry of regulators worldwide to scrutinize Facebook's data practices.After the revelations, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission opened a probe into Facebook over concerns that the social media firm had violated the terms of a previous agreement with the agency, which required it to give users clear notifications when their data was being shared with third parties.Facebook in 2019 agreed to a record $5 billion settlement with the FTC. Facebook also agreed to pay $100 million to settle a case around the same time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations the company made misleading disclosures about the risk of misuse of user data.Cambridge Analytica, which shut down after the allegations in 2018, was controversial because the data it harvested from Facebook was used to inform political campaigns.In 2018, Britain's Channel 4 News filmed Cambridge Analytica executives suggesting that the firm would use sex workers, bribes, ex-spies and fake news to help candidates win votes around the world.Since the scandal, Facebook changed its name to Meta to reflect its growing ambitions to become a leader in the metaverse, a term used to refer to virtual worlds. Facebook, still one of the world's biggest social media firms, is run by Meta.But Facebook has seen a slowdown in growth due to a slowing in the advertising market, changes to Apple's iOS privacy rules and rising competition from TikTok."

Hart also said interactions with government groups indicated their offices were being infected and implementing work-from-home at a similar pace to what businesses had seen."
2022-12-23,"Maybe this is a temporary respite from ever-higher prices or just maybe — as some of us have forecast all along — the economy hasn't been going through a 1970s style inflation spiral.Instead, it was going through a pandemic and war-related disruption that boosted inflation for a limited time before the economic world edged back toward normal.Certainly, Friday's inflation data, included in the personal income and spending report, showed a marked deceleration in so-called personal consumption expenditure inflation.Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, noted that core PCE is annualizing at a less than 3% rate. That's below where most forecasters expected it to be at this point in the cycle.Over the past five months, many measures of inflation have fallen more quickly than forecast, including those most closely watched by the Federal Reserve. Reviewing rent data, whether from the Cleveland Federal Reserve and Bureau of Labor Statistics' new measurement system or from Redfin, rents and housing prices are falling rapidly which will further pressure both headline and core inflation readings in the months ahead.Add to that a Wall Street report that confirms what some of us have been noticing for months — that the global supply chain is back to normal.Shipping rates are well below prepandemic levels, cargo backlogs have disappeared, and goods are traveling around the world to ports of call.This is all good news, irrespective of what many doomsayers continue to forecast: sticky inflation, slower growth (certainly not yet evident, though recession risk remains high in 2023) and the need for the Fed to continue tightening regardless of what they perceive as only temporary progress on inflation.I say, the Fed has done its job. It now risks doing too much and pushing the U.S. economy into an entirely unnecessary recession next year.Sadly, that clouds the visibility around next year's economic and market behavior.While it's rare to have consecutive annual declines in the stock market, it's not impossible if the Fed fails to consider the vast improvements in the inflation outlook and insists on raising rates further.That comes at a time when seasonal and historical patterns — like the presidential cycle — favor a positive stock market performance in 2023.U.S. investors have seen asset inflation disappear quite rapidly in 2022 as trillions of dollars have been hacked off U.S. equity market capitalization.Speculative sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, meme stocks, special purpose acquisition companies and IPOs is all but gone, reducing systemic financial risk and recreating value in long-dated assets.        The issue of wage inflation, which the Fed continues to fight, would be solved with more generous immigration reform, but absent that, it will be solved with technology.First, as was the case in 2021, U.S. population growth was abysmal this year, rising only 0.4%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.In 2021, the U.S. population grew at its slowest pace in the history of the U.S.Labor force and population growth are being adversely affected by slower-than-expected family formation and immigration constraints. Life expectancy has also been declining due to Covid, as well as opioid overdoses that totaled over 100,000 in 2021, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Millions are also facing long Covid, which is likely keeping many out of the labor force.Some in Congress, like Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, have tweeted their opposition to letting more immigrants into the U.S., saying that all open jobs should go to Americans first.Well, they have … all of them.There are roughly 5 million more open jobs than there are unemployed Americans, so unless we start delivering babies who are old enough to enter the workforce at birth, clone existing adults or find millions of people refusing to go to work, we need people — low, medium and highly skilled workers — in large quantities. On the technology front, entry-level jobs are being challenged by technological advances. McDonald's, for instance, is experimenting with a partially automated store in Texas.While humans still prepare the food, orders are taken by, essentially an A.I.-driven device, payment is made electronically and the food is delivered via conveyor belt, inside the store for takeout, or through the drive-thru window in the same manner.There is no interaction with humans in the process.If other quick-service restaurants were to follow this, it would be wildly disinflationary.China, of course, remains a wild card in questions about global inflation, disinflation or outright deflation.After abandoning its zero-Covid policy, as many as 248 million Chinese citizens have contracted Covid since the start of December with as many as 37 million getting sick in a single day, Bloomberg News reported.The much-heralded reopening of China has yet to materialize.There's more disinflation likely coming from China than growth and inflation.Given recession risk in Europe and the United Kingdom, a continued war in Ukraine and unfriendly central banks, 2023 could be as rough as 2022.All that makes for a very difficult outlook in the new year.Simply put, in the midst of a national bomb cyclone, 2023 policies, economic and market action, is ""cloudy with a chance of meatheads."" — Ron Insana is a CNBC contributor and a senior advisor at Schroders."
2022-12-26,"During the Monday morning rush hour, traffic in Beijing surged by about 90% from a week ago — to ""heavily congested"" levels, according to Baidu data.The rebound in social activity in Beijing over the last few days is an example of how long it might take for the country to shake off the economic impact of zero-Covid controls.The province of Zhejiang near Shanghai said Sunday that daily Covid infections in the region have surpassed 1 million, and will likely double to a peak of 2 million a day around New Year's. BEIJING — People are returning to the streets in China's capital city as it emerges from a wave of Covid infections.During the Monday morning rush hour, traffic in Beijing surged by about 90% from a week ago — to ""heavily congested"" levels, according to Baidu data.Over the weekend, ticket orders for Beijing city attractions doubled from the prior week, according to data cited by Chinese business news site 21st Century Business Herald. CNBC was unable to verify the figures.Anecdotally, foot traffic at malls and Universal Beijing Resort's CityWalk over the weekend was up significantly to modestly crowded levels. Not all stores have reopened yet. Christmas is not a public holiday in mainland China, but often celebrated by younger people.In contrast to the surge in Beijing city traffic, Shanghai and Shenzhen still saw very low levels of congestion Monday morning, the Baidu data showed. The two cities started to see a wave of Covid infections after Beijing did.The rebound in social activity in Beijing over the last few days is an example of how long it might take for the country to shake off the economic impact of zero-Covid controls. A month ago, Beijing residents were dealing with a surge in apartment lockdowns and subsequent public protests. In early December, municipal and central authorities abruptly ended many Covid controls amid a surge in infections.The city said visits to fever clinics soared by 16-fold in a week — to 22,000 on Dec. 11. Four days later, the daily number had climbed to 73,000 visits, but by Dec. 21, the figure had eased to 65,000 visits, according to an official report Saturday. The city has a population of about 22 million.The share of severe Covid cases and elderly patients has increased, the report said. It cited a director at a local hospital as saying the share of visits by the elderly had climbed from below 20% to nearly 50%.China's elderly have lower Covid vaccination rates and often have underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to the virus. Anecdotally, deaths have ticked up.However, there are fewer and fewer official disclosures. China's National Health Commission on Sunday stopped sharing daily figures on Covid infections and deaths, ending a practice of nearly three years.One of the official arguments for maintaining strict Covid controls was that the already stretched national health system would struggle to handle a surge in infections. Despite the lack of national-level public data, Zhejiang province — bordering Shanghai —shared Sunday some of the most detailed official numbers on Covid.The province said daily Covid infections in the region have surpassed 1 million, and will likely double to a peak of 2 million a day around New Year's. The province has a population of about 65.4 million, more than 70% of which live in cities such as Hangzhou, home to Alibaba.Zhejiang said fever clinics in the province have a maximum daily capacity of 600,000. Authorities said that among larger hospitals in the province, there were more than 12,000 intensive care unit beds, or 9.9% of open beds.Monday morning traffic in Hangzhou was very light, according to Baidu data. While people are staying home in some parts of China as infections surge, other areas in addition to Beijing are seeing a recovery in social activity.The southwestern cities of Chengdu and Chongqing saw large jumps in road traffic to congestion levels as heavy as Beijing's, Baidu data showed.

2022-12-26,"Finland, Iceland, Scotland, Wales and New Zealand are all members of the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership. The coalition, which is expected to expand in the coming months, aims to transform economies around the world to deliver shared well-being for people and the planet by 2040. ""The need for a new economic model has never been clearer,"" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told CNBC. LONDON — For a small but growing network of countries, the world's go-to metric of economic health is no longer fit for purpose.Mostly led by women, Finland, Iceland, Scotland, Wales and New Zealand are all members of the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership. The coalition, which is expected to expand in the coming months, aims to transform economies around the world to deliver shared well-being for people and the planet by 2040.That means abandoning the idea that the percentage change in gross domestic product is a good indicator of progress, and instead reframing economic policy to deliver quality of life for all people in harmony with the environment.""The need for a new economic model has never been clearer,"" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told CNBC. ""Which I think is why we're seeing such growing interest in the well-being economy approach, both here in Scotland and around the world.""Encouraging other policymakers to consider an economic approach centered on well-being, Sturgeon said multiple global crises, such as the climate emergency, biodiversity loss and the cost-of-living crisis, ""raise fundamental questions about what we value — and what our economies are actually for.""""Building a wellbeing economy is a huge challenge for any country, at any time, and the current crises we are facing make it harder — but they also underline why we need to make this transformation as a matter of urgency,"" Sturgeon said. ""We've made progress over the past five years, but we still have much more to do."" In just the last few months, New Zealand published its first national Wellbeing Report; the European Union recognized the need to shift to a well-being economy; and the World Health Organization launched an initiative that calls for well-being to be at the heart of economic recovery.Australia, Canada and Costa Rica are among some of the countries to have worked closely with the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership in recent months, and ""post-growth"" advocates believe it is just a matter of time before more countries embrace the well-being movement. A post-growth society is one that resists the demand for constant economic growth. Dominick Stephens, chief economic advisor at the Treasury in New Zealand, hailed the country's first well-being report as a ""landmark moment,"" saying it aims to provide lawmakers with a big-picture view of what life is like in the South Pacific nation.""We want to look beyond GDP to understand progress, but we don't have a singular measure of wellbeing — so we need to look across a range of indicators and evidence to understand progress in this broader sense,"" Stephens told CNBC.""This helps us all to understand where New Zealand is doing well, where we are lagging and how wellbeing is experienced differently for different people in our country.""Among the findings published on Nov. 24, the report highlighted the wide and growing gap between the well-being of older citizens and that of younger citizens, with older citizens faring better on a range of metrics. The Treasury identified three priority areas in need of improvement: mental health; educational achievement; and housing affordability and quality.Stephens said that while the report would not be the final word, it's now up to New Zealanders to decide on the extent to which they are concerned about those issues and the actions needed to address them.""We do not have a silver bullet in New Zealand on how to do Wellbeing Reporting well,"" Stephens said. ""Different countries have taken different approaches. We are, in some ways, building the plane as we fly it.""""More countries trying different approaches to integrating wellbeing analysis into policy means more opportunities for New Zealand, and other countries, to learn from the experiences of others,"" he added. The gathering momentum for a transformation of the current economic system comes half a century after the Club of Rome think tank published its groundbreaking ""Limits to Growth"" report.The 1972 book warned that the planet's resources would not be able to support the exponential rates of economic and population growth and would therefore collapse before the end of this century. Broadly speaking — and following a sharp backlash to its dire predictions at the time — the world has gone down the path that the book's authors predicted it would.Academics and economists told CNBC that an ultimatum from the world's top climate scientists about the dangers of exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius of global heating — a critically important temperature threshold beyond which dangerous tipping points become more likely — underscores the need to end an obsession with growth at all costs. ""If they hadn't realized it 50 years ago that we already needed to shift, I think now is the time because we are confronted with a polycrisis,"" Sandrine Dixson-Declève, co-president of the Club of Rome think tank, told CNBC via telephone.The term ""polycrisis"" refers to crises that occur in multiple global systems and become entangled in such a way that they produce harms greater than those crises would in aggregate.""Not only is our planet sick from continued growth scenarios, because we have gone way beyond a healthy use of natural resources, but our people are getting increasingly sick, and our young people are making less and less money,"" Dixson-Declève said.When asked whether that means she believes there is no alternative to a well-being strategy, Dixson-Declève replied, ""Yes, absolutely. I often say that we need to shift from power, profit and patriarchy to people, planet and prosperity."" U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy once said a country's GDP measures everything ""except that which makes life worthwhile.""Critics of GDP, which represents the total value of goods and services over a specific time period, argue that the indicator is misleading because it measures ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" of economic activity and calls it all good.GDP does not, for instance, take into account unpaid work, nor does it distinguish between economic activity which contributes positively or negatively to the health and well-being of people and the natural environment. In the U.K., Rishi Sunak said in his first speech as prime minister that his predecessor Liz Truss was not wrong to want to improve economic growth in the country. ""It is a noble aim,"" Sunak said outside Downing Street on Oct. 25.Three months earlier, opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said Britain needed three things to fix its broken social contract. ""Growth. Growth. And growth.""""I think it just shows our lack of imagination. We can't even imagine an economy that is better than growth,"" said Katherine Trebeck, co-founder of the Wellbeing Economy Alliance, a network of academics, businesses and social movements.""The best we can do is put some nice adjectives in front of growth — sustainable growth, green growth, inclusive growth, shared growth — but we are almost not allowed to entertain the prospect that a growing economy is a 20th-century recipe,"" she added.""High-income nations have got enough in overall terms but there are huge profound inequalities within the richest countries. So, what they need to do is think about how to share and cherish those resources,"" Trebeck said. ""I use the phrase that they need to recognize that they've arrived. The job of growth has been done and they need to now move to a second project which is about making themselves at home.""Trebeck described well-being economics as a ""picnic blanket term,"" which encompasses movements such as ""degrowth,"" ""doughnut"" economics or circular and regenerative models rather than an alternative policy.""I think there is a profound moral obligation [on high-income countries] because they are taking up more than their ecological fair share which is implicitly saying that countries around the world that don't have enough to meet the basic material needs of their citizens are effectively going to stay there,"" Trebeck said.""It is about really saying how do we live fairly on this one finite planet?"" The push to look beyond economic growth comes at a time of growing calls to end fossil fuel production worldwide.""Basically, with a growth commitment, you have a commitment to more energy and material use which then consequently results in environmental impacts — and it makes decarbonization harder,"" Julia Steinberger, ecological economist at the University of Lausanne, told CNBC via telephone.""What you need to do for decarbonization is you need to stop using all fossil fuels and replace energy demand with renewable or low or zero-carbon energy sources and that is harder to do [and] it is going to take longer to do if we have constantly growing energy demand,"" Steinberger said. ""That's the climate case for it.""The South Pacific island nation of Tuvalu last month became the first country to use the U.N.'s annual climate summit to push for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. The European Parliament, the Vatican and WHO have all backed the proposal.But only a handful of small countries have endorsed the initiative to date, and the fossil fuel industry has typically sought to underline the importance of energy security in the planned transition to renewables.The burning of fossil fuels — such as coal, oil and gas — is the chief driver of the climate emergency. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also recently joined a chorus of voices calling for GDP to be dropped as the world's go-to indicator of economic growth, pushing instead for policymakers to shift to a circular economy.This refers to an economic system that is based on the reuse and repair of materials to extend the life cycle of products for as long as possible and moves away from the world's current ""take, make, throw away"" model.""We need to change course — now — and end our senseless and suicidal war against nature,"" Guterres said at a major international environmental meeting in early June.""We must place true value on the environment and go beyond Gross Domestic Product as a measure of human progress and wellbeing,"" Guterres said. ""Let us not forget that when we destroy a forest, we are creating GDP. When we overfish, we are creating GDP. GDP is not a way to measure richness in the present situation in the world."""
2022-12-26,"Travelers entering China will still have to undergo PCR testing 48 hours before departure, however, the health authority said.China's management of Covid-19 will also be downgraded to the less strict Category B from the current top-level Category A. China will stop requiring inbound travelers to go into quarantine starting from Jan. 8, the National Health Commission said on Monday in a major step towards easing curbs on its borders, which have been largely shut since 2020.China's management of Covid-19 will also be downgraded to the less strict Category B from the current top-level Category A, the health authority said in a statement, as the disease has become less virulent and will gradually evolve into a common respiratory infection.Three years of zero-tolerance measures, from shuttered borders to frequent lockdowns, have battered China's economy, fueling last month the mainland's biggest show of public discontent since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.But China made an abrupt policy U-turn this month, dropping nearly all of its domestic Covid curbs in a move that has left hospitals across the country scrambling to cope with a nationwide wave of infections.Strict requirements on inbound travelers had remained in place, including five days of mandatory quarantine at a government-supervised facility and three more of isolation at home. That restriction and one on the number of passengers on international flights will be removed from Jan. 8. Travelers entering China will still have to undergo PCR testing 48 hours before departure, however, the health authority said.Arrangements for foreigners to come to China, such as for work and business will be improved and the necessary visas will also be facilitated, the authority said.But passenger entry and exit at sea and land ports will gradually resume, while the outbound travel of Chinese nationals will be restored ""in an orderly manner,"" it added.Since January 2020, China had classified Covid-19 as a Category B infectious disease but managed it under Category A protocols that cover diseases such as bubonic plague and cholera, giving local authorities the power to quarantine patients and their close contacts and lock down regions.While China downgrades its management of the new coronavirus, the National Health Commission said epidemic prevention and control protocols at key institutions such as elderly care institutions will be strengthened.

2022-12-27,"Forward Air CEO Tom Schmitt described fourth quarter demand as ""unusually slow"" in an interview with CNBC's Frank Holland.The logistics CEO says that weak demand may last a few quarters of 2023 as much inventory already has moved into warehouses domestically.With China's shift in some Covid policies, Lunar New Year and the overall economy should be moving back closer to the pre-pandemic normal, but ""we're not there yet,"" he said. Forward Air shares are delivering on something few companies have as the year draws to a close. The stock is beating the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter.The trucking and logistics company, which counts Home Depot and Delta Air Lines among its customers, receives 30% of its revenue from e-commerce, 40% from industrial trucking, and 30% from specialty trucking for high-value services including live events and health-care equipment.Forward Air CEO Tom Schmitt recently spoke with CNBC's Frank Holland about the holiday shipping season, the volume his customers are expecting for Lunar New Year, and the supply chain, trucking, and pricing outlook for 2023. Watch the video above for his predictions.Below are a few of the highlights from the conversation.Fourth quarter weakness will extend into 2023Schmitt described the fourth quarter as ""unusually slow,"" and he said that wasn't a surprise amid consensus view that it would not be a ""very pronounced"" peak season.The issue: amid weaker demand, a lot of inventory was already shipped from Asia to North America, and already sitting in warehouses closer to the consumer.This situation won't end with the close of 2022. ""The first few months of next year there is consensus there will be slowness,"" Schmitt said. ""It will be like that for the next quarter or two.""Shippers make less, Peloton helps explain whyForward Air is in a high-value niche, handling shipping for concert tours and medical equipment, and higher rates can be achieved in these areas with lower to no margin for error on delivery times, he said, but throughout the logistics space there is less profit right now as a function of overall shipment trends.He gave the example of heavy treadmills sold during the e-commerce boom, and which in recent history came in orders of seven but are now down to three ""because others are already sitting in warehouses,"" he said.All companies in the shipping sector will be dealing with margin pressure over next quarter or two, he said, simply because there are fewer pieces per shipment.The freight company is raising rates, with its annual increase set for 5.9% in February 2023. Schmitt said spot rates are down and that ""transactional softness"" will remain, but contract will continue to be strong.China trade outlookWhile China's trade economy will rebound, but it will take time, with inventories still adjusting downward from gluts already shipped and less coming in before the logistics industry will get to a more normalized rate, "" the seven treadmills vs. three starting to kick in again,"" Schmitt said.His outlook for Lunar New Year sales is similar, with signs that China will ""start living in a post-Covid economy,"" albeit with some forms of safety practices at an enhanced level. ""But I expect more normal ... closer to pre-pandemic with this year Lunar New Year, but we're not there yet,"" Schmitt said."
2022-12-27,"By all technical definitions, the U.S. is still in a pandemic. As of September, the World Health Organization has only declared the end of the pandemic ""in sight,"" but not here yet — especially as Covid cases rise and threaten another harsh winter wave. Some pandemic lifestyle changes like mask-wearing in the U.S. remain common, especially as the Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommends wearing masks in areas with high infection rates including New York and Los Angeles.America's money habits, however, have almost completely gone back to pre-pandemic trends. After nearly two years of significant disruption — for better or worse — these are three examples of how the pandemic economy ended in 2022:  Major retailers like Walmart and Target made headlines this year for excessive inventories hurting their bottom lines as consumers shifted their spending habits. After stocking up on electronics and other home goods for much of the last two years, consumers are back to spending on services including travel and entertainment.Consumer expenditures on durable goods were up about 6% in October from the previous year, compared with a more than 8% increase in services spending according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Two of the industries that suffered the most at the onset of the pandemic — travel and hospitality —  have made near-full recoveries. Consumers returned to the skies with global airline passenger traffic nearing 74% of September 2019 levels this past fall according to the International Air Transport Association.And whether in their hometowns or while they were traveling, Americans found themselves eating at restaurants even more than they did in 2019, data from reservation platform OpenTable shows. Though airlines and restaurants alike continue dealing with labor shortages amid an overwhelming surge in customer demand, the long lines and sold-out reservations that defined the industries this year reflect a return to normal leisure activities for much of the population.  Consumers may have been expecting to spend more this year in light of returning to working in person and going out for fun. But persistently high inflation and fears of a coming recession made it difficult for folks to keep their spending in check and maintain good saving habits.The government's financial aid that helped consumers meet those goals through the height of the pandemic didn't exist in 2022, changing the way people use their money again, according to Angeli Gianchandani, an expert in consumer behavior as a practitioner in residence for the brand marketing and executive MBA programs at the University of New Haven.""The stimulus checks and the unemployment benefits allowed people to spend — they were spending money, because they had it,"" she says. Those government subsidies allowed folks to spend more, but they were also saving money not commuting to work, shopping for clothes or getting their hair done.""The spending shifted, and now the pendulum has swung so far to the other side with inflation,"" she says. ""We're seeing this impact that's just such a change and creating a burden for people.""After paying off loads of credit card debt and saving at higher rates than ever before during the height of the pandemic, many consumers are back to relying on credit to cover everyday purchases. It wasn't just events like the GameStop frenzy that made the stock market exciting in 2021, but also the fact that the markets seemed to be fully recovered and poised to keep growing as the world continued to re-open. But that optimism began to slide at the end of last year and has continued its descent throughout 2022.Not only will the major stock indexes end the year on a sour note, but other major investments like buying a house got more painful this year as the Fed hiked interest rates to help curb inflation.A combination of pandemic-induced factors — more downtime at home, pent-up savings and low interest rates — allowed consumers to spend and invest more freely throughout the height of the pandemic. Now, with prices high, the economy's health uncertain and a number of other crises still bubbling (war in Ukraine, climate change, U.S. political tension), people are looking for stability.""This uncertainty we may be going through, you're gonna see again consumers are going to change habits,"" Gianchandani says. From where they shop to where they work and where they invest, she says folks are looking for companies to take a stand and show how they create value for their shareholders beyond just returns. ""Companies need to be able to speak to their customer be transparent and forthcoming, and help them build that trust to overcome any of these challenges.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Investing experts predict a 'soft-ish landing' for the economy in 2023—here's what that means for your money"
2022-12-28,"The Office for National Statistics reported that between June and August 2022, around 2.5 million people cited long-term sickness as the main reason for economic inactivity, an increase of around half a million since 2019.In its report last month, the ONS said a range of factors could be behind the recent spike, including National Health Service waiting lists that are at record highs, an aging population and the effects of long Covid.

Unlike other major economies, recent U.K. data shows no sign that these lost workers are returning to the labor market, even as inflation and energy costs exert huge pressure on household finances.The U.K. avoided mass job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic as the government's furlough program subsidized businesses to retain workers. But since lockdown measures were lifted, the country has seen a labor market exodus of unique proportions among advanced economies.In its report last month, the ONS said a range of factors could be behind the recent spike, including National Health Service waiting lists that are at record highs, an aging population and the effects of long Covid.""Younger people have also seen some of the largest relative increases, and some industries such as wholesale and retail are affected to a greater extent than others,"" the ONS said.Though the effects of the issues mentioned above haven't been quantified, the report suggested the increase has been driven by ""other health problems or disabilities,"" ""mental illness and nervous disorders,"" and ""problems connected with [the] back or neck."" Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King's College London, told CNBC the scale of the labor market depletion is likely a combination of long Covid; other pandemic-related health issues such as mental illness; and the current crisis in the NHS.On top of that, he noted that factors that hurt public health directly — such as increased waiting time for treatment — could have a knock-on effect: people may have to leave the workforce to care for sick relatives.""It's worth remembering the U.K. has been here before, arguably at least twice. In the early 1990s, the U.K. saw a sharp recovery, with falling unemployment, after 'Black Wednesday,' but it also saw a large, and lasting, rise in the number of people claiming incapacity-related benefits,"" Portes said, adding that not working is generally bad for both health and employability. ""The government clearly isn't doing very much about this. Apart from resolving the crisis in the NHS, the other key policy area is support for sick and disabled people to get back to work, and there's not nearly enough happening on this — instead the government is harassing people on Universal Credit with penalties and sanctions which we know don't help much.""In his recent Autumn Statement, Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt announced that the government will ask more than 600,000 people receiving Universal Credit — a means-tested social security payment to low-income or unemployed households — to meet with a ""work coach"" in order to establish plans to increase hours and earnings.Hunt also announced a review of the issues preventing reentry into the job market and committed £280 million ($340.3 million) to ""crack down on benefit fraud and errors"" over the next two years.Although the pandemic has greatly worsened the health crisis leaving a hole in the U.K. economy, the rise in long-term sickness claims actually began in 2019, and economists see several possible reasons why the country has been uniquely vulnerable. Portes suggested that the government's austerity policies — a decade of sweeping public spending cuts implemented after former Prime Minister David Cameron took office in 2010 and aimed at reining in the national debt — had a significant part to play in leaving the U.K. exposed.""The U.K. was particularly vulnerable because of austerity — NHS waiting lists were rising sharply, and performance/satisfaction was falling sharply, well before the pandemic,"" Portes said.""And support for those on incapacity and disability benefits was hollowed out in the early 2010s. More broadly, austerity has led to a sharper gradient in health outcomes by income/class."" That's borne out in the national data: The ONS estimates that between 2018 and 2020, males living in the most deprived areas of England on average live 9.7 years fewer than those in the least deprived areas, with the gap at 7.9 years for females.The ONS noted that both sexes saw ""statistically significant increases in the inequality in life expectancy at birth since 2015 to 2017.""In the aftermath of the pandemic, NHS waiting lists grew at the fastest rate since records began in August 2007, a recent House of Commons report highlighted, with more than 7 million patients on the waiting list for consultant-led hospital treatment in England as of September.However, the report noted that this isn't a recent phenomenon, and the waiting list has been growing rapidly since 2012. ""Before the pandemic, in December 2019, the waiting list was over 4.5 million – almost two million higher than it had been in December 2012, a 74% increase,"" it said.""In other words, while the rise in waiting lists has been accelerated by the pandemic, it was also taking place for several years before the pandemic.""Former Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders, now a senior policy advisor at Oxford Economics, also told CNBC that the U.K. has been particularly badly affected by Covid in terms of severity, and that some of this may have been the result of the country's higher rates of preexisting health conditions — such as obesity — which may have been exacerbated by Covid.""The U.K. is a relatively unequal country, so that may be part of the reason why even if we've had the same Covid wave as other countries, we might get a bigger effect on public health, because if you like you have a greater tail of people who would be worst affected by it,"" he added.Saunders suggested that any growth strategy from the government should include measures to address these health-care challenges, which are now inextricable from the labor participation rate and the wider economy.""It's not just a health issue, it's an economic issue. It's important in both ways. I think it's important enough as a health issue, but it merits extra importance because of the effects on potential output which then feed through to these other economic problems."""

Chalk that up to Tesla's latest bad day (see more below), although there are plenty of tech culprits for the Nasdaq's woeful performance this year. The index has lost more than 33% so far in 2022, and there are only three trading days left, including Wednesday.

Tesla shares are down about 69% so far this year, and they're off more than 70% since their all-time high in November 2021. CEO Elon Musk has sold multiple chunks of shares to help pay for his takeover of Twitter, and the electric vehicle maker's stock has declined more than 50% since the deal was completed in October. Musk, no longer the world's richest person, has also alienated Tesla's American customer base – affluent, left-leaning people who are environmentally conscious – with his embrace of extreme right-wing figures and conspiracy theories. Shares of Tesla, which fell another 11% Tuesday, are on a seven-day losing streak. Even if things get better in the next three days, and they may not, given new Covid problems for the company in China, Tesla is about to wrap its worst month, quarter and year on record.

""Without this data, it is becoming increasingly difficult for public health officials to ensure that they will be able to identify any potential new variants and take prompt measures to reduce the spread,"" officials said. With infections exploding in China, Japan said it would start requiring negative tests for travelers from mainland China at the end of this week. Taiwan will implement similar requirements. The Supreme Court on Tuesday left in place a rule that allows the U.S. to deport migrants at the Mexican border as a health precaution. More than 2 million migrants have been deported under the rule, called Title 42, since it went into effect in 2020, as the country struggled to respond to the spread of Covid. The justices also agreed to hear oral arguments on the rule in February. A ruling is expected in June. The policy will stick around at least until then. Read more from CNBC's Spencer Kimball.

Mainland China's reopening came sooner than expected for investors, and Goldman Sachs warns it will lead to short-term strains in the workforce and supply chains.According to mobility data analyzed by economists at Goldman Sachs, China is likely to see ""weaker growth momentum during the frontloaded 'exit wave' on the back of surging infections, a temporary labor shortage and increased supply chain disruptions,"" it said in a note Tuesday.""Amid the rapid reopening, the challenge to China's medical system may have been significantly escalated, especially for less developed inland and rural areas amid the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday,"" Goldman economists including Lisheng Wang and Hui Shan wrote, adding that they expect mainland China's daily new cases to reach a peak in late December or early January.On Saturday, Shanghai's Tesla factory reportedly suspended production as the company faced a fresh wave of Covid cases within its Chinese workforce.

2022-12-29,"With experts still debating whether or not 2023 will bring a recession, you might be wary of starting a new venture anytime soon.That's understandable. When the economy is in turmoil, new businesses can face greater hurdles than usual. A downturn could convince investors to hold back their funding. Potential customers could think twice about spending on new products.But, if history is any indicator, your business idea could still thrive even a recession occurs. Multiple high-profile startups that did just that after launching during the Great Recession, which ran from late-2007 to the summer of 2009.It's proof that even tough times aren't enough to prevent every great idea from growing into a flourishing business — especially if your idea can save other people money during tough times.Here are five such successful companies that launched during the Great Recession: Helping people trim down their expenses is typically a winning proposition no matter the economic climate. That's especially true in the midst of a recession.The idea led Tim Chen to found the popular personal finance website NerdWallet, after he was laid off from his hedge fund job around the 2008 holiday season. Losing his job at the time was ""super devastating"" for the now 39-year-old NerdWallet co-founder and CEO, he told CNBC Make It in 2018.But, he added, being unemployed also gave him the freedom to launch his own business.After fielding a question from his sister about how to find a credit card with lower fees, Chen said he was ""shocked I couldn't find anything on Google that wasn't basically marketing [or] promotional material.""He put together an Excel spreadsheet comparing different credit cards and sent it to his sister — and then decided to launch a website that could offer other people a similar service. Last year, NerdWallet went public in an IPO. Chen's company now has a market value of more than $700 million. When Uber first launched in early 2009, it was billed as a cheaper and more efficient alternative to hailing a taxi off the street. Unsurprisingly, the idea of saving money caught on with customers on the backside of a recession.The idea for Uber was inspired, in part, by co-founder Garrett Camp's $800 expenditure to hire a private driver for himself and friends on New Year's Eve. He and co-founder Travis Kalanick discussed how splitting the cost would have made the experience significantly cheaper, and together, they got to work building an app.The service won over users who were still accustomed to years of spending carefully. It's had some significant bumps in the road since then — from allegations of sexual harassment and a toxic work culture to a $20 million FTC fine over driver recruitment practices, all leading up to Kalanick's ouster in 2017.It also undeniably transformed the transportation industry, while inspiring rivals like Lyft. Today, Uber has a market value of roughly $50 billion. Saving money was the whole idea behind Groupon, the e-commerce marketplace aimed at helping users track down coupons and discounts for local retailers. Groupon started out as a website called The Point, which founder Andrew Mason built in 2007 as a platform where people could gather to further collective goals. Then, the recession hit, and users began organizing group purchases of products to save money through bulk discounts.Mason and co-founder Eric Lefkofsky spotted opportunity and rebranded the platform as Groupon, a portmanteau of the words ""group"" and ""coupon.""It hasn't all been smooth sailing over the past few years. In 2020, the company laid off or furloughed 2,800 employees, roughly 40% of its workforce, citing ""deteriorated"" business amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The company laid off another 500 workers earlier this year, as part of cost-cutting measures meant to generate positive cash flow by the end of 2022.Today, Groupon has more than 20 million active customers — a lot, but less than half of its 54 million customers in 2014.Still, the publicly-traded company's market value is more than $200 million. Mobile payments platform Venmo launched in 2009 at the tail end of the recession, inspired by a moment of forgetfulness from co-founder Iqram Magdon-Ismail: He left his wallet at home before visiting his college friend and future co-founder, Andrew Kortina.The two friends had already discussed how helpful it would be to transfer funds to acquaintances with a mobile app connected to your bank account. Magdon-Ismail's mishap cemented the idea in their minds.In 2013, PayPal acquired Venmo for $800 million. The app currently has more than 90 million users.Even today, the app is a tool associated with fiscal responsibility. In 2018, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman told CNBC that he's seen Venmo help people who grew up during the Great Recession become more thoughtful about taking care of their money.""It's very important to them if they have their own independence, and these apps like Venmo are incredibly powerful in helping and empowering them to take care of their financial health,"" Schulman said. When Brian Acton and Jan Koum founded popular messaging service WhatsApp in February 2009, they probably weren't inspired by the recession — but they were well aware of the ups and downs of the market.The two engineers had worked at Yahoo for nearly a decade, with Acton losing millions of dollars when the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. They left Yahoo in 2007, and traveled around South America before embarking on their next venture.In January 2009, six months after Apple debuted its iOS App Store, Koum bought an iPhone. The pair predicted a rush of new apps, and started thinking about business ideas to capitalize on it.Initially, WhatsApp gave you status updates for the people listed in your phone's contact list. Those early iterations of the app kept crashing and proved unpopular with their friends, so Koum and Acton remade WhatsApp as an instant-messaging service.In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, turning Koum and Acton into billionaires. The pair continued running WhatsApp until 2018, when they left amid disagreements with Facebook over digital advertising on the platform.In 2020, WhatsApp topped two billion users worldwide.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Self-made billionaire: 4 poker skills can help you become highly successful"
2022-12-29,"Amazon shares are about to wrap up their worst year since 2000 and second worst on record.The stock has plunged 51% this year, wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap.Among the most valuable tech companies, Amazon still performed better than Meta and Tesla.  It was a brutal year for mega-cap tech stocks across the board. But 2022 was especially rough for Amazon.Shares of the e-retailer are wrapping up their worst year since the dot-com crash. The stock has tumbled 51% in 2022, marking the biggest decline since 2000, when it plunged 80%. Only Tesla, down 68%, and Meta, off 66%, have had a worse year among the most valuable tech companies.Amazon's market cap has shrunk to about $834 billion from $1.7 trillion to start the year. The company fell out of the trillion-dollar club last month.Much of Amazon's misfortunes are tied to the economy and macro environment. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates have pushed investors away from growth and into companies with high profit margins, consistent cash flow and high dividend yields.But Amazon investors have had other reasons to exit the stock. The company is contending with slowing sales, as predictions of a sustained post-Covid e-commerce boom didn't pan out. At the height of the pandemic, consumers came to depend on online retailers like Amazon for goods ranging from toilet paper and face masks to patio furniture. That drove Amazon's stock to record highs as sales soared.As the economy reopened, consumers gradually returned to shopping in stores and spending on things like travel and restaurants, which caused Amazon's impressive revenue growth to fade. The situation only worsened at the start of this year, as the company confronted higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos at the helm in July 2021, admitted that the company hired too many workers and overbuilt its warehouse network as it raced to keep up with pandemic-era demand. It's since paused or abandoned plans to open some new facilities, and its head count shrank in the second quarter. Jassy has also embarked on a wide-ranging review of the company's expenses, resulting in some programs being shuttered and a hiring freeze across its corporate workforce. Last month, Amazon began making what's expected to be the largest corporate job cuts in its history, aiming to lay off as many as 10,000 employees.Even Amazon's cloud computing segment, typically a refuge for investors, recorded its weakest revenue growth to date in the third quarter.Looking to 2023, several analysts have reduced their estimates, citing persistent macro headwinds and continued softness in online retail and cloud computing.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney, in a Dec. 18 note, lowered his 2023 estimates for Amazon, predicting total retail sales growth for the year of 6%, down from 10%. He cut his forecast for annual Amazon Web Services revenue growth to 20% from 26%.Still, Mahaney said he remains bullish on Amazon's long-term prospects, calling it a ""buffet buy"" because of its assortment of businesses. He pointed to Amazon's growing share in retail, cloud and advertising, its apparent insulation from risks such as ad privacy changes, and its continued investment in areas like groceries, health care and logistics.""For those investors who utilize 2-3 year time horizons and are looking to take advantage of the recent dislocation in high quality 'Net stocks, we highly recommend AMZN,"" wrote Mahaney, who has an outperform rating on the stock. While recessionary concerns are real and earnings estimate will have to come down, ""AMZN remains arguably the highest quality asset we cover in terms of Revenue and Profit outlooks,"" Mahaney wrote.WATCH: Recession could mark end of headwinds for tech stocks like Amazon and Meta"
2022-12-30,"The Nasdaq closed out its worst year since 2008 and is mired in a downturn that's drawing many comparisons to the dot-com crash.""It's really hard to be positive on tech right now,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures.The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1% in the fourth quarter, wrapping up its first four-quarter losing streak since 2000-2001. A lot has changed in technology since the dot-com boom and bust.The internet went mobile. The data center went to the cloud. Cars are now driving themselves. Chatbots have gotten pretty smart.But one thing has remained. When the economy turns, investors rush for the exits. Despite a furious rally on Thursday, the tech-laden Nasdaq finished in the red for a fourth straight quarter, marking the longest such streak since the dot-bomb period of 2000 to 2001. The only other negative four-quarter stretch in the Nasdaq's five-decade history was in 1983-84, when the video game market crashed.This year marks the first time the Nasdaq has ever fallen all four quarters. It dropped 9.1% in the first three months of the year, followed by a second-quarter plunge of 22% and a third-quarter decline of 4.1%. It fell 1% in the fourth quarter because of an 8.7% drop in December.For the full year, the Nasdaq slid 33%, its steepest decline since 2008 and the third-worst year on record. The drop 14 years ago came during the financial meltdown caused by the housing crisis.""It's really hard to be positive on tech right now,"" Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, told CNBC's Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. ""You feel like you're missing something. You feel like you're not getting the joke."" Other than 2008, the only other year worse for the Nasdaq was 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst and the index sank 39%. Early dreams of the internet taking over the world were vaporized. Pets.com, infamous for the sock puppet, went public in February of that year and shut down nine months later. EToys, which held its IPO in 1999 and saw its market cap grow to almost $8 billion, sank in 2000, losing almost all its value before going bankrupt early the next year. Delivery company Kozmo.com never got its IPO off the ground, filing in March 2000 and withdrawing its offering in August.Amazon had its worst year ever in 2000, dropping 80%. Cisco fell 29% and then another 53% the next year. Microsoft plummeted by more than 60% and Apple by over 70%.The parallels to today are quite stark.In 2022, the company formerly known as Facebook lost roughly two-thirds of its value as investors balked at a future in the metaverse. Tesla fell by a similar amount, as the carmaker long valued like a tech company crashed into reality. Amazon dropped by half.The IPO market this year was non-existent, but many of the companies that went public last year at astronomical valuations lost 80% or more of their value.Perhaps the closest analogy to 2000 was the crypto market this year. Digital currencies Bitcoin and ether plunged by more than 60%. Over $2 trillion in value was wiped out as speculators fled crypto. Numerous companies went bankrupt, most notably crypto exchange FTX, which collapsed after reaching a $32 billion valuation earlier in the year. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried now faces criminal fraud charges.The only major crypto company traded on the Nasdaq is Coinbase, which went public last year. In 2022, its shares fell 86%, eliminating more than $45 billion in market cap. In total, Nasdaq companies have shed close to $9 trillion in value this year, according to FactSet.At its peak in 2000, Nasdaq companies were worth about $6.6 trillion in total, and proceeded to lose about $5 trillion of that by the time the market bottomed in October 2002. Despite the similarities, things are different today.For the most part, the collapse of 2022 was less about businesses vanishing overnight and had more to do with investors and executives waking up to reality.Companies are downsizing and getting revalued after a decade of growth fueled by cheap money. With the Fed raising rates to try and get inflation under control, investors have stopped putting a premium on rapid unprofitable growth and started demanding cash generation.""If you're looking solely at future cash flows without profitability, those are the companies that did really well in 2020, and those are not as defensible today,"" Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer of SVB Private, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell: Overtime"" on Tuesday. ""The tech is dead narrative is probably in place for the next couple of quarters,"" Saccocia said, adding that some parts of the sector ""will have light at the end of this tunnel."" The tunnel she's describing is the continuing rate increases by the Fed, which may only end if the economy enters a recession. Either scenario is troubling for much of technology, which tends to thrive when the economy is in growth mode.In mid-December, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest in 15 years, lifting it to a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The rate was anchored near zero through the pandemic as well as in the years that followed the financial crisis.Tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC in late October that more than a decade of zero interest rates ""perverted the market"" and ""allowed manias and asset bubbles to build in every single part of the economy.""Palihapitiya took as much advantage as anyone of the cheap money available, pioneering investments in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), blank-check entities that hunt for companies to take public through a reverse merger.With no yield available in fixed income and with tech attracting stratospheric valuations, SPACs took off, raising more than $160 billion on U.S. exchanges in 2021, nearly double the prior year, according to data from SPAC Research. That number sank to $13.4 billion this year. CNBC's Post-SPAC index, comprised of the largest companies that have debuted via SPACs in the last two years, lost two-thirds of its value in 2022. Predicting a bottom, as all investors know, is a fool's errand. No two crises are alike, and the economy has changed dramatically since the 2008 housing collapse and even more since the 2000 dot-com crash.But few market prognosticators are expecting much of a bounce back in 2023. Loup's Munster said his fund is holding 50% cash, adding that, ""if we thought we were at the bottom we'd be deploying today.""Duncan Davidson, founding partner of venture firm Bullpen Capital, expects more pain ahead as well. He looks at the dot-com era, when it took two years and seven months to go from peak to trough. As of Friday, it's been just over 13 months since the Nasdaq hit its record price.For private equity investors, in 2023, ""I think we're going to see a lot of bargain basement snarfing up of companies,"" said Davidson, who got started in tech investing in the 1980s. To get to the market bottom, ""we may have two years to go,"" he said.WATCH: The IPO market is as bad as it was in 2001"
2022-12-30,"What lies ahead for Iran and its overseas activities will have significant consequences not only for millions of Iranians but also for Ukraine, Russia, much of the Middle East, and the foreign policy of Western governments. The country of 85 million is in the throes of a protest movement that's been described as the biggest challenge to the Islamic Republic government in decades.Meanwhile, Iran's ties with Russia are growing, and it is the closest it has ever been to reaching nuclear bomb-making capability.  It's been a turbulent year for Iran.A year that some hoped would see the revival of the Iranian nuclear deal and successful diplomacy with the West instead saw Iran strengthening its ties with Russia and violently cracking down on a popular protest movement led by women. What lies ahead for the country and its overseas activities will have significant consequences not only for millions of Iranians but also for Ukraine, Russia, much of the Middle East, and the foreign policy of Western governments. The Biden administration went from encouraging negotiations on reviving the Iranian nuclear deal to levying more sanctions on Tehran and condemning it for providing lethal weapons and training to Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. Iran's Foreign Ministry denies knowing about Iranian weapons transfers to Russia, despite evidence of Iranian-made drones wreaking havoc on Ukrainian cities.And the country of 85 million is in the throes of a protest movement that's been described as the biggest challenge to the Islamic Republic government in decades. Meanwhile, its economy is spiraling and it is currently enriching uranium at its highest level ever — meaning Iran has never been closer to reaching nuclear bomb-making capability.  ""2023 is going to be a pivotal year for Iran,"" Ali Vaez, Iran project director at non-profit Crisis Group, told CNBC. ""The economy is in more trouble than ever; the society is more disgruntled than ever; and the country is more isolated than ever."" ""The Islamic Republic is where the Soviet Union was in the early, not late, 1980s,"" Vaez said. ""It's a regime that is ideologically bankrupt, economically broken, and politically paralyzed."" ""However,"" he added, ""it still has a will to fight.""  Already in 2021, the chief of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, told reporters that ""only countries making bombs"" are enriching uranium at Iran's level of 60% — that's just one technical step away from weapons grade, which is 90% purity.Under the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal — which involved the U.S. and other powers and lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program — Iran's uranium enrichment was limited to 3.67%, enough for a civilian nuclear energy program.  ""The prospects for the revival of JCPOA are dim for 2023,"" said Henry Rome, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, referring to the deal by its official acronym, which stands for Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.Rather than call it off entirely in response to Iran's apparent support for Russia and brutal crackdown on protesters, ""an 'extend and pretend' attitude toward the nuclear deal will probably continue for some time,"" Rome added. Negotiations have been stalled since September. The Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018, reimposing severe sanctions on Iran that both damaged its economy and spurred its government to ramp up nuclear development. And prospects of the Biden administration reviving the accord are shrinking fast.What's more, time is running out for anything to be salvaged at all — key nuclear restrictions in the deal will expire in late 2023 as ""sunset clauses"" set in.    ""The actual JCPOA will be increasingly in obsolescence in 2023,"" said Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at Rane. And, he added, ""neither Europe nor the United States wants to offer sanctions relief to a regime actively cracking down on protesters.""Negotiators may have to start from scratch, and Western signatories to the deal will likely want to see a resolution to the protest movement first, some analysts say. In the meantime, the West is announcing new sanctions while Iran keeps pushing ahead with its nuclear development, creating a larger and larger chasm between the two sides.""Iran is likely going to continue making quantitative and qualitative advances on its nuclear program while reducing international monitoring,"" warned Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Beyond stockpiling more uranium for a bomb and developing the machines needed to enrich uranium with a lesser footprint and greater rates,"" he said, ""Iran is likely to move closer to being a threshold nuclear power."" Nationwide protests that began in mid-September and quickly spread to scores of cities across Iran were triggered by the death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish Iranian woman who died in police custody after being arrested for allegedly breaking Iran's strict headscarf rules. The unrest ballooned into a full-blown movement demanding the removal of the Islamic Republic, Iran's hardline theocratic government. But after nearly four months and a campaign of bloody crackdowns and executions by the state, the question remains: How long will the protests last? ""The four forces to keep your eyes peeled on in 2023 on Iranian protests are streets, strikes, sanctions, and security forces,"" said ben Taleblu. He expects there will be sustained protests in 2023 against the Islamic Republic, despite the government having an overwhelming advantage when it comes to the use of force. ""The regime retains all the tools of repression and will increasingly use them,"" he said, but added that Iranians' demands for political change inevitably mean more domestic instability. Most Iran analysts interviewed by CNBC expect the demonstrations to continue in some form, but predictions on their intensity and effectiveness vary.While the protests may still take unexpected turns, ""the demonstrators have not yet mustered sizable, sustained support in key economic sectors or attracted defections from the security services,"" Rome noted. As for Rane's Ryan Bohl, the most likely outcome is that the protests ""are eventually suppressed and dissipate."" The second outcome, he said, is that the movement becomes institutionalized, turns into a viable opposition movement and is able to extract concessions from the regime. The third and ""least likely"" — but still not impossible — outcome in the next year is that ""the protest movement escalates to include other sections of Iranian society and causes splits within the regime that might actually threaten its survival,"" Bohl said. The latest conflict between Iran and the West came amid the Russia-Ukraine war in the form of lethal Iranian drones used by Russian forces to attack Ukraine. That has already prompted more U.S. and EU sanctions on Iran — but that's unlikely to stop the growing collaboration between the two increasingly isolated countries. ""Iran can't afford to alienate Russia,"" Crisis Group's Vaez said. ""The West will have to be creative in finding a way"" to slow and limit the kinds of weapons it can transfer to Russia, he said — something already underway, as the Biden administration is reportedly working to choke off Iran's access to foreign components for the weapons.  Still, ""more drones and missiles and technical cooperation on military matters seems likely,"" Bohl said, in addition to deeper trade links to create a ""sanctions proof trade network.""That will have diplomatic costs, which Tehran appears willing to weather, though it's unclear what it will get in return — cash, weapons, technology or a combination of those.Either way, ""Iran is likely to continue playing hardball in 2023,"" Ben Taleblu said, adding, ""I fully expect Russia and Iran to continue tightening security, political, and economic ties in 2023.""  ""An increasingly risk tolerant political elite may feel unstoppable abroad as they face challenges at home,"" he said. ""Should Iran proliferate ballistic missiles and not just drones to Russia for use in Ukraine, it would represent more proof of this perception."""
2022-12-30,"And this culinary boost for the the UAE's travel sector, leaders have announced plans to supercharge the tourism sector.Michelin chiefs say that the UAE is now on par with the big global gourmet destinations such as Paris, New York, Singapore, and London. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — While the economic outlook for much of the world is predicted to be rocky over 2023, in the Gulf there's a buoyant mood.This is partly after the lucrative soccer frenzy in Qatar, but also because the region's tourism sector has never had it so good.This is especially true for the United Arab Emirates, with the country's economy growing by more than 6% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.For the UAE hospitality sector there's a lot on the table — literally, if the rising number of posh new fine dining restaurants is anything to go by. Licensed eateries in the country must be part of a hotel — with a few exceptions in the finance district of DIFC — so this is a vital business tie-in.And as ever in this part of the world, the competition to be the most extravagant and lauded is already high — as illustrated by the competitive spirit on display in the UAE's inaugural Michelin Guide Dubai awards a few months back.The capital Abu Dhabi saw three of its restaurants recognized with one star — Talea by Antonio Guida, for its ""Cucina di Famiglia"" or family style Italian cuisine; Hakkasan, a restaurant celebrating traditional Cantonese flavors; and ultra-trendy Japanese restaurant 99 Sushi Bar — notable for creations such as whole king crab leg au gratin, with wasabi, tobiko and yuzu mayonnaise.Down the road in Dubai — Abu Dhabi's boisterous neighbor and unofficial rival — an impressive eleven restaurants were served Michelin stars, including upmarket Italian eatery Armani Ristorante located at the base of the city's most famous landmark, the soaring Burj Khalifa.Chef Giovanni Papi confirmed to CNBC that accolades this year from the likes of Michelin have been pulling in well-to-do foodies, both locals and tourists alike. ""Since our latest recognitions and awards, we have seen an increase in gourmet guests,"" he said.The kitchen at Armani Ristorante is currently showcasing an ambitious truffle-themed degustation menu starting at 949 dirhams ($258) a head — or 1,559 dirhams with wine pairing. It includes intricate dishes such as Bottoni Ripieni, composed of button-shaped ravioli filled with braised lamb and artichoke, Castelmagno cheese fondue, and lamb ragout.While there are officially no three-star Michelin restaurants yet in the UAE, November did see three Michelin-starred chef Pierre Gagnaire swing by his restaurant Pierre's TT at the InterContinental Dubai. The French maestro is a regular visitor to Dubai and has been one of the more serious global chefs setting the gastronomic agenda in the emirate.For a few nights only, well-heeled guests sampled creations such as pan-fried squid with black garlic, Paris mushrooms and rocket.Gagnaire commented at the event: ""The food scene here is fast developing … this visit put me in awe to see the remarkable achievements that the country has achieved in developing the food craft so exquisitely and there can be no more inspiring location than Dubai for a restaurant.""Michelin chiefs agree, saying that the UAE is now on par with the big global gourmet destinations such as Paris, New York, Singapore, and London.""The selection criteria for all Michelin Guide restaurants are the same as per our global standard review process, where anonymous inspectors review all cuisines and evaluate only the quality of the dishes,"" Gwendal Poullennec, international director of the Michelin Guides, told CNBC.""We would say the restaurants in the Michelin Guide selection in the UAE are equal to the big cities."" However, for some local gastronomists there is a fly in the consommé — the fact that although this year's Michelin selection encompassed cuisines from across the European and Asian continents, no UAE restaurant specializing in Middle Eastern cuisine was awarded a star.Speaking to CNBC, Samantha Wood, founder of popular impartial restaurant review website FooDiva.net commented: ""The UAE's heavy reliance on imported produce, despite a growing choice of local ingredients is a detriment — which ties into the high price tag attached to restaurants here. However, what's more disappointing, is that some restaurants that do maximize our local bounty are not recognized in the Michelin guide.""Wood added: ""Of the 11 one and two star restaurants in the Dubai guide, only two are independent, chef-led concepts — despite the huge pool of talent here. It's these restaurants who Michelin should be recognizing at the highest level, rather than focusing on imported celeb chef concepts available anywhere in the world."" There was recognition for Middle Eastern cooking among the Michelin Bib Gourmand awardees — a category for restaurants that offer a three-course gourmet experience priced at an average of 250 dirhams. Winners include home-style Levantine restaurant Bait Maryam, and Al Khayma, featuring rustic Emirati cooking.Interestingly, restaurants with the Bib Gourmand distinction have carved out a successful niche for themselves. Far from being sub-Michelin venues, they're being enjoyed as Instagrammable spaces for a special dining experience — perhaps without the austerity of the Michelin star tag.A nice example is Fi'lia on the 70th floor of the glamourous new SLS Dubai hotel. This trendy eatery offers ""fresh ingredients from the firewood oven and grill, handmade breads and pasta"" with a distinctly upmarket twist. Think gnocci and caviar with rosemary butter, and 1kg salt crusted branzino.The management at Fi'lia appear more than happy with their foodie ranking.""Our objective was never to aim towards a Michelin star, and we are quite realistic about it,"" Claudio Cardoso, culinary director at SLS Dubai Hotel, told CNBC.""Having a Bib Gourmand on the other hand really reflects on what was always the aim of Fi'lia, affordable dishes with good quality ingredients. It's all about good food that people can relate to … like our mothers used to make.""And with this culinary boost for the UAE's travel sector, leaders have announced plans to supercharge the tourism sector and increase its contribution to the national GDP from the current 177 billion UAE dirhams to a whopping 450 billion dirhams by 2031.According to Abdullah bin Touq Al Marri, minister of the economy, the strategy plans to attract investments worth 100 billion dirhams and bring 40 million hotel guests to the region.  "

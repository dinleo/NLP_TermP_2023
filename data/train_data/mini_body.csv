2022-01-04,"The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a protocol that sells nonfungible tokens (NFTs) of domains representing wallet addresses, generated buzz within the crypto community in November after it airdropped tokens to its users. Those who claimed the tokens earned governance rights over the ENS and can vote on future decisions regarding the protocol.It was so well received that it prompted other Ethereum projects to airdrop tokens too. Though airdrops aren't new, they've recently become increasingly common.In an airdrop, projects distribute tokens to specific investors' wallets. In some situations, like with the ENS, projects airdrop tokens to those who have used their product. Other times, projects airdrop tokens to potential investors in hopes of marketing their product.The process of receiving the airdropped tokens can differ too. Sometimes, investors must choose to accept the tokens by claiming them, while other times, investors cannot reject the airdrop and tokens are automatically dropped in their wallets.The ENS airdrop seems legitimate, as the ENS has existed for years and it required investors to vote on a ""foundational ENS governance constitution"" that detailed the authority of holders before claiming their tokens. But airdrops are often used by crypto scammers. In some cases, they may try to airdrop fictitious tokens to an investor's wallet to prompt them to visit a phishing website.It can be difficult to tell whether an airdrop is safe or not, and investors should be cautious. Before claiming airdropped tokens or interacting with any that may have landed in your wallet, there are a few things to do first. If you have the option to claim airdropped tokens, you should first look into the project distributing and see whether it has a viable product.Even if the airdropped token is safe to claim, its project may be designed to benefit a select few founders or core contributors. Details about a drop and its project can be found in its code, on its website or via its social media. Look into a project's fundamentals and what it proposes before connecting your wallet to its website.Both the OpenDAO and Gas DAO, two Ethereum-based projects, recently airdropped tokens, which quickly surged in value before declining. While the airdrops garnered excitement from some, others expressed concern, saying the projects behind the tokens lacked product development, utility and had security risks. This isn't uncommon.If tokens land in your wallet through an airdrop you didn't initiate, it's best to wait before engaging. Some airdrops may prompt you to visit a website to sell or swap the tokens, but there's a possibility it's a phishing attempt to access your wallet and funds. When researching, there are a few common red flags to be aware of, many of which can be seen when analyzing a project's smart contract, which are collections of code that carry out a set of instructions on the blockchain.For one, if a project lacks on-chain security to protect funds, its founders or developers might be able to control the movement of funds. This commonly happens in ""pump and dump"" or ""rug pull"" schemes, where developers abandon a project and leave with investors' funds.In addition, it might be a bad sign if a project airdropping tokens doesn't have a product, plan, governance outline or other things of that nature. Claiming tokens now with the promise of being told details later can be dangerous. While this can sometimes also be the case for early crypto projects, where there isn't any malice, it's worth keeping in mind.Project founders should be somewhat receptive to answering questions on Discord or Twitter, especially if people are calling out potential issues or concerns. If they aren't, that can be a red flag as well.Another is if a project charges a fee when you try to swap or sell the tokens, or simply doesn't allow you to swap or sell at all. Smart contracts are essential for most crypto-based projects to run. Although they can be quite technical, it's worth checking out the smart contract behind a project, or asking someone knowledgeable about the space to do so. If there is an issue with a developer's code, intentionally or not, then there could potentially be weaknesses within the project.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:You could be leaving your crypto wallet open to hackers—here's how to protect it'People have been participating without understanding the risks': Here's what to know about cryptocurrency-based DeFiElon Musk continues to tweet about altcoins like baby dogecoin—but investors should tread very carefully"

China's central bank has launched a pilot version of a wallet app for the digital yuan in a push to expand its usage to more people.The app is available on China's Android app stores and Apple's app store. It allows users to open a digital yuan wallet and spend the currency.The digital yuan or e-CNY is a digital version of China's sovereign currency and has been in the works since 2014. It is not a cryptocurrency like bitcoin but is instead issued and controlled by the People's Bank of China.So far, China has done a number of trials around the country in the form of lotteries where users in certain cities have been given a small amount of digital currency to spend. Some retailers, such as e-commerce company JD.com, have accepted it as payment in the past year.But the digital yuan has not yet officially been rolled out nationally and there is no timeline for this.The new app allows users in 10 areas including major cities Shanghai and Beijing to use it. Previously, only select users could use the app on an invitation basis. But now everyone can download the app, highlighting how China is trying to get more people to use the digital currency. The ""Beijing Winter Olympics areas"" is one of the places that the digital yuan can be used, according to a notice on the app. The Winter Olympics, which takes place this year in the Chinese capital, has been one of the events that the People's Bank of China has been targeting bringing the digital yuan to.Still, the e-CNY app will face stiff competition from China's two dominant digital payment apps — Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat."
2022-01-04,"Bitcoin could see further upside and reach $100,000 by the middle of this year, claims Antoni Trenchev of crypto lender Nexo.Bitcoin has been a winner in the pandemic era, rising more than 80% in 2021 despite being far off record highs hit earlier that year.However, some experts have warned that bitcoin may be poised for a steep drop in the coming months. Bitcoin could see further upside and surge as high as $100,000 by the middle of 2022, according to Antoni Trenchev of cryptocurrency lender Nexo.The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $46,170.43 as of 8:42 p.m. ET Monday, according to data from Coin Metrics.""I think [bitcoin's] going to reach $100,000 this year, probably by … the middle of it,"" Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at Nexo, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Monday. The firm claims to be the world's largest lending institution in the digital finance industry, according to its website. The company has issued more than $6 billion in credit and manages assets for more than 2.5 million users globally, it said.Bitcoin has largely been a winner in the pandemic era, rising more than 60% in 2021 despite being far off its record high of around $69,000 earlier that year. In comparison, the S&P 500 rose nearly 27% during the same period, while the Dow and Nasdaq gained 18.73% and 21.39% for the year, respectively.But not everyone is as bullish as Trenchev.Some experts have warned that bitcoin may be poised for a steep drop in the coming months. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, said she sees bitcoin tanking as low as $10,000 in 2022, virtually wiping out all of its gains in the past year and a half. Lingering regulatory scrutiny on the sector and wild price swings could also weigh on the outlook for bitcoin.On his part, Trenchev said there were ""two simple reasons"" why he sees big gains ahead for bitcoin.One is that institutions are ""building out their treasuries"" and filling it with the cryptocurrency, he said, without providing any examples. Firms such as MicroStrategy and Square are among known examples of companies that have bought massive amounts of bitcoin.Another reason is his prediction that ""cheap money"" is here to stay — which will be a boon for cryptocurrencies.

2022-01-05,"After a record-breaking year for cryptocurrency in 2021, many investors may soon face a hefty tax bill for their good fortune.But it can be difficult to calculate digital asset balances without Form 1099-B, summarizing profits and losses.  After a record-breaking year for cryptocurrency in 2021, many investors may soon face a hefty tax bill for their good fortune. The digital asset market value soared past $2 trillion, with bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $69,000 in November and ether surging to nearly $5,000 during the same period.While prices dipped in December, many investors still saw sizable year-over-year growth.

Loading chart... Since cryptocurrency is considered property, it may be subject to capital gains when exchanged or sold at a profit.    If you exchange digital coins, cash out to U.S. dollars or make a purchase, it may be a taxable event, said Matt Metras, an enrolled agent and cryptocurrency tax specialist at MDM Financial Services in Rochester, New York.The gain or loss is the difference between your purchase price, known as the basis, and value upon sale or exchange, and tax rates depend on how long you have owned the coin.  You may qualify for long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on taxable income, if you hold the currency for more than one year. However, selling or exchanging assets after less than one year triggers short-term capital gains, with regular income tax rates, up to 37% for top earners.And many crypto investors trade digital coins frequently, according to a CNBC survey, with roughly one-third trading weekly or monthly, and nearly a quarter trading daily.   One of the biggest crypto tax challenges is many investors don't keep records of transactions, and it's difficult for exchanges to track assets moving between wallets and brokers. For example, if you bought bitcoin on Coinbase, transferred it to your wallet and then moved it to Gemini, the second exchange wouldn't know the original purchase price, Metras said.  While the deadline for Form 1099-B, which brokers use to report an investor's profits and losses, is Jan. 31, it's unclear which crypto exchanges, if any, will send these forms for 2021.Despite limited reporting, the IRS still expects you to report crypto transactions, Markowitz said. If exchanges don't provide Form 1099-B, you may be left with each broker's spreadsheet of transactions or other reporting options, which may still be difficult to reconcile.""The best thing to do is try to reverse-engineer it,"" said Metras.You can reconstruct records by importing each exchange's files into crypto tax reporting software. ""It is overwhelming when it's a big mess,"" Metras said. ""But everything adds up eventually.""There are several companies that can provide Form 8949 to summarize crypto activity and file your returns, Markowitz said.However, errors may be possible, and the reporting may not be sufficient for an IRS audit, he added."
2022-01-05,"NFTs could become ""a much bigger, more fluid market"" than bitcoin, ""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary predicted.His belief in NFTs stems from the idea that can they prove ownership of real-world items, such as designer watches or flash cars.""We'll see what happens but I'm making that bet and I'm investing on both sides of that equation,"" O'Leary told CNBC. ""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary is a big believer in non-fungible tokens — he even thinks they have a shot at becoming bigger than bitcoin.O'Leary, the chairman of O'Shares Investment Advisers, said his belief in NFTs stems from the idea that can they prove ownership of real-world items, such as designer watches or flash cars, digitally rather than with paper records.NFTs are one-of-a-kind crypto tokens that serve to track the provenance and authenticity of rare virtual collectible items such as art and sports memorabilia. There have also been efforts to bring NFTs to physical assets.""You're going to see a lot of movement in terms of doing authentication and insurance policies and real estate transfer taxes all online over the next few years, making NFTs a much bigger, more fluid market potentially than just bitcoin alone,"" O'Leary told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" Wednesday.""We'll see what happens but I'm making that bet and I'm investing on both sides of that equation.""Barely anyone had heard of NFTs in 2020, but they became a huge phenomenon the following year. More than $20 billion worth of the tokens changed hands throughout 2021, according to some estimates. The trend gained particular public attention after a collage by the digital artist Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, was sold for a record $69 million. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of the market. Some have compared it to the initial coin offering frenzy of 2017, which saw several investors get defrauded by betting on start-ups through unregulated token sales. Meanwhile, there have been a number of scams and instances of stolen art, raising red flags for some traders. The millionaire Canadian investor has changed his tune on crypto over the years, having previously called bitcoin ""garbage.""""It is a useless currency,"" O'Leary told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in May 2019. ""It's worthless.""More recently, O'Leary has warmed to the space, viewing it as a way of diversifying from other assets such as real estate amid rising inflation. He is particularly bullish on ""decentralized finance,"" a trend that aims to replicate traditional financial products using blockchain.O'Leary recently disclosed that his largest position is in ether, while he also owns some polygon, solana and bitcoin.Around 40% of new checks O'Leary has written in the last six months were for crypto and blockchain-related ventures. O'Leary stressed the importance of ensuring crypto becomes regulated. Regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere are racing to catch up with developments in the market to prevent potential money laundering and protect consumers from financial harm.""Different geographies have different policy regarding crypto,"" O'Leary said. ""You have to go and find jurisdictions that are more progressive."" He cited Canada, his home country, as an example of a jurisdiction that is more progressive than others on the issue of crypto.Canada was the first to approve an exchange-traded fund that gives investors exposure to bitcoin. Though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has since greenlit a bitcoin-linked ETF, the product tracks futures contracts instead of investing in bitcoin directly.O'Leary also cited the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland as other countries that are opening up to crypto.""You have to be optimistic and constructive,"" O'Leary said. ""The floodgate of capital will come in through sovereign and pension plans that doesn't exist yet.""Of particular concern to regulators are stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to the value of sovereign currencies like the dollar. Economists worry notable stablecoins like tether and USD Coin may not have the appropriate reserves available to justify their claims of being backed by dollars.""I think [stablecoins] will also get a chance to shine in the sun as a great way to get yield when you can't get any yield on cash,"" O'Leary said."

He said it can be compared to gold, because, by design, there is a limited supply of bitcoin.""I think over time, inflation-hedge assets are probably likely to do better,"" Dalio told Green. ""That's why I'm not favorable to cash and those types of things.""Diversification is extremely important, Dalio told Green. But even when it comes to bitcoin, ""one wonders, when does somebody take the money they made in bitcoin and then diversify that?

2022-01-06,"The second-biggest country for bitcoin mining lost its internet access, taking as much as 15% of the network offline.Kazakhstan is home to coal mines that provide a cheap and abundant supply of energy, which is a major incentive to miners who compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy.Bitcoin fell below $43,000 for the first time since September in trade on Thursday, falling over 8% at one point. As the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan plunged into chaos this week, an internet shutdown hit the world's second-biggest bitcoin mining hub, in yet another blow to miners searching for a permanent and stable home.Less than a year ago, China banished all of its cryptocurrency miners, many of whom sought refuge in neighboring Kazakhstan. But months after these crypto migrants set up shop, protests over surging fuel prices have morphed into the worst unrest the country has seen in decades, leaving crypto miners caught in the middle.After sacking his government and requesting the aid of Russian paratroopers to contain the fatal violence, president Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev ordered the nation's telecom provider to shutter internet service. That shutdown took an estimated 15% of the world's bitcoin miners offline, according to Kevin Zhang of digital currency company Foundry, which helped bring over $400 million of mining equipment into North America.As Kazakh miner Didar Bekbau put it, ""No internet, so no mining.""Bitcoin dropped below $43,000 for the first time since September in trade on Thursday, falling over 8% at one point. The price move followed the release of hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting. Castle Island Ventures' Nic Carter thinks the supply delta from changing the pace of mining is minimal and that the falling price of bitcoin is more a function of the Fed and ""general risk-off behavior.""Internet service was briefly restored in the country, but data from monitoring group NetBlocks Internet Observatory shows that connectivity levels continue to flatline at just 5% of ordinary levels across the country.""It's now Friday morning in Kazakhstan where internet has been shut down for some 36 hours, placing public safety at risk and leaving friends and family cut off,"" NetBlocks wrote in a tweet.The entire episode lays bare two significant facts about the state of the bitcoin mining industry. For one, the bitcoin network is resilient to the point that it doesn't skip a beat, even when a substantial portion of miners are unexpectedly taken offline. Second, the U.S. may soon see a fresh influx of crypto miners looking to avoid future disruptions. The question now is whether the U.S., which eclipsed China as the planet's largest bitcoin mining hub in 2021, has the room to take in any more miners.""What's concerning is that previous congestion and bottlenecks around hosting capacity (readily available space to plug machines into) will be squeezed that much tighter,"" explained Zhang.""There's a tremendous amount of pressure and demand for hosting capacity,"" he said. When Beijing kicked out all its bitcoin miners in May 2021, Kazakhstan seemed like a logical destination. Beyond the fact that it was right next door, the country is also a major energy producer.Mining is the energy-intensive computing process used to create new coins and maintain a log of all transactions. Kazakhstan is home to coal mines that provide a cheap and abundant supply of energy, which is a major incentive to miners who compete in a low-margin industry where their only variable cost is typically energy.It also helps that the Kazakh government typically has a more lax attitude about building, which is good for for miners who need to construct physical installations in a short period of time.  Bekbau runs Xive, a company that provides hosting services to international miners and sells the specialized equipment needed for mining. In the last several months, he's fielded countless inbounds from Chinese miners looking for a safe place to plug in their gear.Kazakhstan is just behind the U.S. in terms of its share of the global bitcoin mining market, with 18.1% of all crypto mining, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.But the government hasn't exactly been thrilled about its burgeoning crypto mining industry.For months, Kazakh lawmakers have been setting down new rules to discourage mining, including a law that will introduce extra taxes for crypto miners starting in 2022. Experts expect the move will significantly change the incentives for people looking to deploy capital inside Kazakhstan.""The internet outage comes at the heels of efforts to impose a de facto ban on new mining in the country, so miners will have been well aware of the political risk there,"" said Carter.""These bans just underscore why miners are increasingly locating themselves in politically stable jurisdictions,"" continued Carter. Several mining experts also tell CNBC they think that Kazakhstan was always intended to be a temporary stopover on a longer migration west.Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners, said that large miners were going to Kazakhstan in the short-term with older equipment.""But as older-generation machines reach the end of their service lives, those companies will likely deploy new machines into more stable and energy efficient and renewable jurisdictions,"" Brammer said.The U.S. has fast become a mecca for crypto mining, in part because it is home to some of the cheapest sources of energy on the planet, many of which tend to be renewable.If miners do make their way west, it could bode well for the larger debate around bitcoin's carbon footprint.Carter points out that Kazakh energy is carbon-intensive, so just like the Chinese ban, a prolonged outage in the Central Asian country would likely have the net effect of further decarbonizing bitcoin mining.But not all are convinced of an imminent crypto mining exodus from Kazakhstan. Alan Dorjiyev is president of the National Association of Blockchain and Data Centers Industry in Kazakhstan, whose membership is mostly comprised of mining companies. Dorjiyev tells CNBC that after speaking to owners of mining farms across the country, it is his understanding that most data centers are safe, because they are located in regions where there are no protests.Bekbau also remains optimistic, tweeting that he hopes by next week, ""everything will be okay.""Whether miners make the move out of Central Asia or not, industry experts tell CNBC that the biggest takeaway of this entire ordeal is the fact that bitcoin mining has yet again survived another stress test with little drama.""As we saw with China, when a country demonstrates it's unstable for mining bitcoin, miners in that country will move elsewhere,"" said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi, who now runs Meow, a company that enables corporate treasury participation in crypto markets.""This is how the bitcoin network gets more resilient over time. Miners migrate towards the most favorable jurisdictions, making disruptions less and less frequent."""

2022-01-06,"Scammers around the world took home a record $14 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021, thanks in large part to the rise of DeFi.Losses from crypto-related crime rose 79% from 2020.Cryptocurrency theft increased 516% from 2020, to $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Of this total, 72% of stolen funds were taken from DeFi protocols. Scammers took home a record $14 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021, thanks in large part to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, according to new data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.Losses from crypto-related crime rose 79% from a year earlier, driven by a spike in theft and scams.Scamming was the greatest form of cryptocurrency-based crime in 2021, followed by theft — most of which occurred through hacking of cryptocurrency businesses. The firm says that DeFi is a big part of the story for both, in yet another warning for those dabbling in this emerging segment of the crypto industry.""DeFi is one of the most exciting areas of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, presenting huge opportunities to entrepreneurs and cryptocurrency users alike,"" Chainalysis wrote in its annual Crypto Crime report.""But DeFi is unlikely to realize its full potential if the same decentralization that makes it so dynamic also allows for widespread scamming and theft."" DeFi is a rapidly growing sector of the crypto market that aims to cut out middlemen, such as banks, from traditional financial transactions, like securing a loan.With DeFi, banks and lawyers are replaced by a programmable piece of code called a smart contract. This contract is written on a public blockchain, like ethereum or solana, and it executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary. ""The financial system is basically sending money around with various terms and conditions attached to it,"" said Joey Krug, chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, a cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused asset manager. DeFi transaction volume grew 912% in 2021, according to Chainalysis stats. Impressive returns on decentralized tokens like shiba inu also spurred a feeding frenzy among DeFi tokens.But there are a lot of red flags when it comes to dealing in this nascent crypto ecosystem.One problem with DeFi, according to Kim Grauer, Chainalysis' head of research, is that many of the new protocols being launched have code vulnerabilities that hackers are able to exploit. Twenty-one percent of all hacks in 2021 took advantage of these code exploits.Grauer tells CNBC that while there are third-party firms that perform code audits and publicly designate which protocols are secure, many users still opt to work with risky platforms that bypass this step if they think they can get a large return.Cryptocurrency theft rose 516% from 2020, to $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Of this total, 72% of stolen funds were taken from DeFi protocols.Losses from scams climbed 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency.More than $2.8 billion of this total came from a relatively new but very popular type of scheme known as a ""rug pull,"" in which developers build what appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency projects, before ultimately taking investors' money and disappearing.""Given the hype around DeFi, people may have been more OK with using less secure platforms due to a fear of missing out on potential gains,"" explained Grauer. Crypto-related crime may be at an all-time high, but researchers note that the growth of legitimate cryptocurrency usage far outstrips the growth of criminal usage.Transactions involving illicit addresses represented an all-time low of just 0.15% of the $15.8 trillion in total crypto trade volume in 2021.The research firm identifies illicit funds based on their connection to confirmed illicit activity. For example, funds would be considered illicit if they were sent to or from a darknet market, or were known to have been stolen in a hack.""The fact that the increase was just 79% — nearly an order of magnitude lower than overall adoption — might be the biggest surprise of all,"" Chainalysis wrote.""Crime is becoming a smaller and smaller part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem,"" continued the report.Researchers partly credit the curbed growth of crypto-based crime to the evolving toolkit of law enforcement, as well as the inherit transparency of blockchain technologies.Crime is becoming a smaller and smaller part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Chainalysis2021 Crypto Crime ReportUnlike cash and other traditional forms of value transfer, every transaction is recorded in a publicly visible ledger, and with the right tools, Grauer says that it is possible to see how much of all cryptocurrency activity is associated with crime.""Authorities have been enormously successful in leveraging the transparency of blockchains to investigate and shut down illicit activity,"" said Grauer.In November, for example, the IRS Criminal Investigation agency said that it had seized more than $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2021 — all from nontax investigations — representing 93% of all funds seized by the division during that time period.Other wins for law enforcement in 2021 included the Department of Justice's $56 million seizure in a cryptocurrency scam investigation, $2.3 million seized from the ransomware group behind the Colonial Pipeline attack, as well as an undisclosed amount seized by Israel's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing in a case related to terrorism financing."

It was built by Nile Niami, a Hollywood-producer-turned-developer, who promoted it as the ""biggest and most expensive modern home in America,"" with an eventual asking price of $500 million. As costs soared, Niami's debt on the house grew to more than $180 million. The megamansion was placed into receivership last year. As part of a bankruptcy agreement struck last month, it was scheduled to be sold at an auction, beginning Feb. 7. People involved in the court process said ""The One"" would have to sell for around $200 million just to pay back the debt, including the auction fees and other costs. If it sells for less, the lenders may have to take a loss, or the property could wind up in further foreclosure litigation. Yet lenders and brokers hope the property is coming to market at an ideal time. Luxury real estate in Los Angeles is breaking records. Sales of properties priced at $10 million or more doubled in 2021 compared with 2019, before the pandemic, with a total of 312 sales, according to Miller Samuel. Marc Andreesen just set a record in California after he paid $177 million for a compound in Malibu, while Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong paid $133 million for a modern mansion, located near ""The One"" in Bel Air.Brokers say interest in ""The One"" has already been strong. Williams said he has two offers on the table — one from a Saudi royal and one from a wealthy Chinese buyer. He said more offers are expected soon from crypto buyers who are ""looking at this house as their own space station."" ""There is going to be huge demand for this property,"" he said. ""Demand for U.S. real estate is through the roof because the dollar is weak and people want real tangible assets.""Kirman added that the property is more than a house — it's a full-scale private resort for ""the billionaire buyer who wants all-inclusive living."" The home sits on 3.8 acres and features 21 bedrooms and 42 bathrooms. Built on a leveled mountain, it has views of the Pacific Ocean, downtown Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Mountains. It has seven water features, including a massive moat that runs around the property. It has a nightclub, a full-service beauty salon, a wellness spa, a home theater that seats 40, a bowling alley, a 10,000-bottle wine cellar, 30-car garage and a 400-foot private outdoor running track. For guests or staff, it has a three-bedroom guest house with its own infinity pool.Still, any buyer of ""The One"" will also have to contend with a thicket of financial and legal issues. According to the receiver's report and an engineering study, the house has cracks in and around many of the pools and stonework, as well as signs of mold. It has several outstanding building and occupancy permits, and a local homeowner's association is challenging its construction. In part because of ""The One"" and other megamansions built nearby, local building laws were changed in recent years to prevent other supersized homes from ever being built again — which brokers say only adds to the value of ""The One."" The lenders also continue to battle each other in bankruptcy court over procedures and priority. Niami weighed in with his own last-ditch effort last month, releasing a video saying he hoped to turn the home into a crypto investment, selling a new token to investors called ""The One Coin"" that would be backed by the property. ""Hopefully, there's someone out there that is going to want to walk hand in hand with me into the stratosphere,"" Niami said in a video. He declined further comment, and lenders and lawyers have dismissed Niami's plans.Ultimately, Kirman said, the 10 years of drama around the house won't deter buyers once they tour the property. ""Its controversial history is no secret,"" he said. ""But when a potential buyer walks the site they'll see the opportunity is so extraordinary that the past won't really matter anymore.""The auction, held by Concierge Auctions, is scheduled to run Feb. 7-10. Bidders would have to wire $250,000 and show proof of funds to qualify for bidding."
2022-01-07,"Victims of the $200 million BitMart hack say that five weeks have passed since the crypto exchange vowed to return their money.In early December, BitMart wrote in an official statement that it would use its own money to reimburse victims of the large-scale security breach, which the exchange blamed on a stolen private key.Many BitMart customers say they haven't received any form of reimbursement. Victims of the $200 million BitMart hack say that five weeks have passed since the crypto exchange vowed to return their money, but many still haven't seen a dime.""I'm not one to bitch and moan a lot,"" said Paul DeLong, a business owner in Austin. ""BitMart, from a communication perspective, they said that they were going to give us more updates. We have not received any updates at all.""DeLong says he has reached out to the exchange multiple times, and each time, he's received a canned response from a bot to inform him that BitMart and their attorneys are ""working on it.""In early December, BitMart wrote in an official statement that it would use its own money to reimburse victims of the large-scale security breach, which the exchange blamed on a stolen private key.But users are getting restless waiting for BitMart to make good on its promise.CNBC spoke to multiple BitMart users who were targets of the attack, some of whom face total financial ruin if their funds aren't retrieved.""Whether it's $20, $500, $10,000, it doesn't matter, just communicate back to us, and let us know,"" said DeLong.Many of the victims lost a particular token known as safemoon, which is a cryptocurrency token built on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. The coin saw a massive run-up in the second quarter of 2021 after a slew of celebrity endorsements from the likes of rapper Lil Yachty and YouTuber Jake Paul.CNBC reached out to ask whether BitMart still planned to make good on its promise to reimburse victims. The email address of BitMart CEO Sheldon Xia, which he lists on his unverified Twitter profile, bounced back, just as it did when CNBC first reached out to Xia in early December.A spokesperson replied, ""We will support all user withdrawals. We're also talking to multiple project teams to confirm the most reasonable solutions such as token swaps. Any further updates will be announced on our official website."" The company did not respond to more detailed questions. CNBC talked to more than a dozen BitMart users personally affected by the breach. One common theme across many of these conversations was a desire for transparency. The shared feeling was that bad news was better than no news.One BitMart user, who said he felt his tokens were ""being held hostage,"" sent CNBC a screenshot of his exchange with the admin who runs BitMart's Telegram account. When he asked Thursday evening whether there was any further guidance on when he would be receiving his safemoon tokens back, the reply read, ""We'll announce when there's an update.""Toronto-based Mohamad, who asked that CNBC just refer to him by his first name, said he feels close to committing suicide because of his experience with BitMart.The Iranian refugee has $53,000 worth of the safemoon token stored on his BitMart wallet, $40,000 of which came from a loan that he has to pay back with 4% interest.The 38-year-old tells CNBC that from 7 A.M. until 10 P.M., seven days a week, he works as a tow truck driver for a road side assistance company. He says he has to work long hours because his employer pays him a per-job commission rather than an hourly wage. He gets $20 per job, but he has to pay for his own diesel fuel.He began to invest in cryptocurrencies to try to carve out a future for himself in Canada.""I just was thinking I can grow my money, then I can go to school to learn English and go to college,"" Mohamad shared with CNBC. ""I don't have any savings.""Another BitMart user tells CNBC that it is not just his money at stake. His mother and mother-in-law pooled together $30,000 and asked him to invest the cash in BitMart on their behalf.""After I put it in, the freaking hack happened, so I was going crazy, because I didn't have anything to give them,"" he said.New York-based ""Mr. Blik,"" who also asked not to use his real name, tells CNBC the timing couldn't have been worse.""This happened close to the holidays...People sometimes have to liquidate some of their positions to cover expenses, to buy things for kids for Christmas. Their inability to make people whole really created an environment where that freedom that we all strive for was taken away from us,"" Mr. Blik said.One Kansas-based crypto investor, who has around $35,000 stuck in BitMart, told CNBC he wasn't terribly worried until recently.""There was some general understanding, even patience, from holders that BitMart was merely waiting until after the first of the year to re-purchase the stolen hot wallet tokens for tax reasons,"" he said.This same BitMart customer now says he is in touch with around 6,800 holders who are considering filing a class-action suit against the exchange. They are giving it about a week until they take action. The company's vagueness has helped fire up the so-called ""Safemoon Army"" — a term given to the community of safemoon token holders, who have historically proven to be a formidable force when they coalesce around a cause.The BitMart hackers made off with a mix of more than 45 coins, but safemoon tokens accounted for a hefty portion of the spoils. While some BitMart users have reported reimbursements for tokens like saitama, safemoon holders remain in limbo.Safemoon investors using BitMart also say they haven't received their ""reflection"" payments — a dividend-like perk distributed to existing holders of the token — since November. BitMart's safemoon investors are therefore feeling doubly burned.Even safemoon holders who have never used BitMart feel they've been indirectly burned by the breach.One United States Air Force veteran made the point that when the hacker stole the safemoon coins and sold them all on the open market, it dropped the price of the entire project. ""We're all affected by this,"" he said.The Safemoon Army is pressuring BitMart through a Twitter campaign designed to shame the exchange into following through on paying back victims of the hack. The safemoon contingent is pushing the Twitter hashtag #WenBitMart, which began trending on Monday night.Although BitMart told CNBC it would support token exchanges, victims say that could cost them money.One person said that if he liquidates his tokens on BitMart to USDT (a popular stablecoin pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar), he would do so at a market position that is one-third of where his safemoon tokens trade today. He would also face a 10% fee for making the trade because of safemoon's trading requirements. (This 10% transaction tax serves as an incentive for users to keep holding the token, which helps put a floor under its price. They also fund dividends that the token creators pay holders as an added incentive.)Even if BitMart does make good and pay everyone back, it remains to be seen whether the exchange will repurchase the equivalent assets lost at their current prices, which in some cases, could be significantly higher.Safemoon's global head of products is himself a BitMart customer. Ryan Arriaga says that 15% of his safemoon stash is on BitMart. But he believes the exchange will do the right thing.""It's not like it was four or five years ago, where a lot of these people who were involved are anonymous...People are wisening up to the space, they understand it more, they can read contracts better,"" said Arriaga.""We've come such a long way now that I believe that BitMart will keep their promise and do the right thing...Especially with the safemoon army, we have such a great support for what we're trying to achieve that it wouldn't die down. It won't only add more fuel to the fire."" As BitMart customers wait for answers, some are biding the time by going deep on the crypto exchange itself. CNBC participated in a Twitter Spaces chat on Wednesday night in which nearly 700 people discussed the situation.BitMart closed a $13.7 million Series B funding round at the end of 2021 at a $300 million valuation, giving pause to some who wonder how the exchange is equipped to self-fund reimbursements of $200 million to customers.Others have asked why BitMart isn't going through insurance to reimburse stolen funds. CNBC put that question to BitMart, and the exchange declined to respond.CNBC also asked if the exchange was running an internal audit to gauge whether anything ran afoul within its own ranks, and again, BitMart opted not to respond to that question.The December hack affected two of BitMart's ""hot wallets,"" but other assets were apparently ""safe and unharmed.""Cryptocurrency can be stored ""hot,"" ""cold,"" or some combination of the two. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and allows owners relatively easy access to their coins so that they can access and spend their crypto. The trade-off for convenience is potential exposure to bad actors.The final and resounding concern among many BitMart users is that instead of halting trading of the affected and non-collateralized tokens, BitMart only stopped withdrawals. CNBC has seen a video in which one person purchased safemoon tokens on the exchange on Jan. 5, well after the hack."

Here's how the pros are playing itJoshua Natolia day agoThe world's largest cryptocurrency began falling earlier this week after the minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting hinted the U.S. central bank would dial back its pandemic-era stimulus.The hawkish comments triggered a sell-off in global stock markets which spilled over into cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin bulls often describe it as an asset that is uncorrelated to traditional financial markets, however experts have noticed growing parallels in the price movements of bitcoin and stocks.Other digital currencies continued to slide Friday, with ethereum shedding 6.8% and solana falling 7.7%. Another piece of news weighing on crypto prices is the Kazakhstan president's move to shutter internet service following deadly protests against the government.The Central Asian country accounts for 18% of the bitcoin network's processing power, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. Many crypto miners fled China for neighboring Kazakhstan over Beijing's ban on virtual currency mining.Kazakhstan's internet shutdown took as much as 15% of the network offline, according to some estimates.Bitcoin's computing power ""is not directly correlated to the price of Bitcoin, but it gives an indication of the network's security, so a fall can spook investors in the short term,"" Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in a note Thursday. - CNBC's Mackenzie Sigalos contributed to this report"
2022-01-10,"The price of bitcoin fell at one point Monday to its lowest level since September, as rising rates continued leading investors to shed positions in risky, growth-oriented assets.Bitcoin fell as much as 6% to touch a low of $39,771.91, according to Coin Metrics, reclaiming most of its losses. It traded about 1.3% lower at $41,904.87 around 4 p.m. ET. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, also took back losses. It tumbled as low as $2,940 in the morning and last traded 3.4% lower at $3,090.67.Declines across the cryptocurrency market follow a week of rough trading for equities, particularly momentum stocks. As the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield spiked to start 2022, investors have been rotating into more cyclical and value names. On Monday, the 10-year climbed as high as 1.8%, after ending 2021 at 1.5%.""We've seen bitcoin behave like a risk asset on numerous occasions over the past few months,"" said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis. ""When the market gets jittery, bitcoin tumbles. We've seen various indications that market sentiment is somewhat spooked by the spike in the 10-year — that's not good for any asset that has high volatility in cash flows. Unlike many assets that are tainted by this brush, bitcoin is liquid and therefore can take more selling pressure without a heavy hit.""Bitcoin hit a record high near $69,000 in November, after a hot inflation reading that at the time showed the biggest jump in consumer prices in 30 years. That reading caused investors to jump into inflation hedges, including bitcoin and gold.Because of the way the cryptocurrency has traded in tandem with equities, investors more than ever are split on whether bitcoin serves as a sound inflation hedge. Last week, Goldman Sachs said it sees bitcoin taking market share from gold and potentially climbing to $100,000.Cryptocurrency prices have fallen steadily since November, however, with bitcoin dropping about 40%. Bitcoin added to its losses last week, after the Federal Reserve indicated its intentions to begin reducing its balance sheet, in addition to what investors have already been preparing for — its tapering of bonds and raising interest rates.""The crypto market looks to be moving in line with the broader macro environment right now, most likely due to increasing overlapping institutional investor base, such as macro funds that allocate to crypto as well,"" said Juthica Chou, head of over-the-counter options trading at Kraken.Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman noted that bitcoin has been diverging from other crypto assets and suggested its moves reflect more about the macro environment and equities than they do about decentralized finance, Ethereum-alternative protocols, NFTs and the metaverse and other crypto sectors and altcoins.""The market dynamic of bitcoin has changed a lot in the last two years,"" he said. ""It went from being largely, you know, crypto native ... now, it really just trades as a 24/7 levered VIX. It's much more important to those who care about the S&P and the big Treasurys, and you're seeing that every day in the price action.""Crypto stocks also fell Monday. Coinbase fell about 3.2%. Crypto banks Silvergate and Signature lost 4% and 3%, respectively."
2022-01-10,"Tech firms will benefit from the metaverse, Web 3.0, cryptocurrencies and quantum computing if they operate in those areas, according to Cyrus Mewawalla, head of thematic research at GlobalData. ""If you're in that space, you're going to benefit almost regardless of macroeconomic issues,"" he said. Apple saw its share price rise to $3 trillion last week but the iPhone maker may not grow as quickly as some of its rivals this year, according to Mewawalla.  Large U.S. tech stocks will shrug off inflation and keep on rising this year thanks to several emerging technologies, according to Cyrus Mewawalla, head of thematic research at data analytics and consultancy firm GlobalData.Tech firms will benefit from the metaverse, Web 3.0, cryptocurrencies and quantum computing if they operate in those areas, Mewawalla told CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe"" Monday.""If you're in that space, you're going to benefit almost regardless of macroeconomic issues,"" he said.On Monday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped nearly 1%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are coming off four straight days of losses. The rough start to the year for stocks has come as interest rates have spiked.Big Tech firms are investing billions into new technologies that have the potential to fundamentally change the way we live and work.At the end of last year, Facebook changed its name to Meta to reflect its focus on the so-called metaverse: a virtual world where humans would interact with one another through digital avatars that can be controlled through virtual reality headsets like Oculus. Elsewhere, firms like Google and Microsoft have also developed VR headsets, while Apple is rumored to be working on one.Several of the tech giants are researching commercial applications for quantum computers, while Meta is planning to launch a cryptocurrency called Diem. So far, most of them have remained quiet on Web 3.0, which is being hailed as the next version of the internet. Last week, Apple saw its valuation rise to more than $3 trillion, making it the most valuable U.S. stock ever and the biggest tech company in the world by some margin. But the iPhone maker's share price may not grow as much as some of the other Big Tech firms this year, according to Mewawalla.""Apple is probably the least likely to grow from here in terms of maintaining its valuation,"" he said. ""It's got a very, very strong ecosystem with very strong execution. So I see very little downside risk. But the upside potential I see more in other big tech stocks."" Asked if there are going to be more surprises to the upside this year with Apple, Mewawalla said CEO Tim Cook has been ""absolutely phenomenal"" over the last 10 years, taking its market cap from around $350 billion to $3 trillion.""But in that time, there's been almost no innovation apart from possibly the Apple Watch, whose operating system operating system is an extension really of iOS,"" he said. ""The Apple TV was a bit of a flop in terms of there wasn't a real new big blockbuster product. Now there's talk of new blockbuster products like an electric car. It may be an autonomous car. Smart glasses, something to do with the metaverse perhaps. But until we see more evidence of that, and of course Apple is notoriously secretive, it's very hard to say.""Meanwhile, Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet are the most exposed in terms of regulation, Mewawalla said, adding that they face a wide range of issues including data, privacy, antitrust and copyright. That said, he doesn't see anything ""major"" happening in the near term.On acquisitions, Mewawalla said they will become ""highly restricted"" in the future, adding that the U.K. and other countries are introducing new M&A laws to prevent companies from becoming too big and powerful.""I think acquisition strategy is going to have to change and it's going to have to take account of greater regulatory scrutiny,"" he said."

Former aides to Sen. Joe Manchin who are now lobbyists are scoring big, influential clients as their ex-boss battles President Biden's agenda.Three of Manchin's previous advisors have recently registered to lobby for at least five new clients: gas and oil giant Hess, media juggernaut Comcast, a nonprofit founded by a former campaign manager for Mike Bloomberg, a group with ties to former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, and an organization partially funded by crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried. The billionaire gave $5 million to a pro-Biden political action committee during the 2020 election.The former aides – including former chiefs of staff to Manchin – registered to lobby for some of these new clients starting in October, while registering for others as recently as December, according to disclosure reports reviewed by CNBC. The lobbying registrations came as Manchin's own influence grew. Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, opposed key elements of President Joe Biden's proposals during the October-December period. Several of the issues listed on the lobbying disclosure forms are related to the Democratic Party's agenda, such as the child tax credit, income tax and greater access to broadband.

Manchin's vote is critical for Democrats in a 50-50 Senate. The West Virginia lawmaker has since said he's had no talks with top Democrats about revisiting the plan.Several of the Manchin-linked lobbyists have previously engaged people on Capitol Hill on behalf of power players in industries such as coal, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, tobacco and finance.A spokeswoman for Comcast declined to comment. The lobbyists and representatives for the new clients did not return requests for comment. Comcast hired Larry Puccio, who counts himself as a friend of Manchin's, to lobby on what's described on the registration form as ""telecommunications – broadband deployment and adoption."" Puccio registered to lobby for Comcast in late November and was Manchin's chief of staff when he was governor of West Virginia.Biden recently signed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that includes $550 billion in new money that is targeted toward transportation, broadband and utilities.In a 2020 interview with a local news outlet in West Virginia, Puccio, a longtime lobbyist, discussed his friendship with Manchin. ""Joe and I are very close. I think the world of Joe. I hope you print that. I've always been supportive of Joe Manchin. Joe knows me and I know Joe,"" Puccio said at the time.Hess recently hired Patrick Hayes, who was Manchin's chief of staff until 2019. Hayes registered to lobby for the oil and gas giant in December.

The lobbying firm says Hayes and his colleagues registered to lobby for Tusk Philanthropies in October with a focus on ""initiatives related to ending childhood hunger including the Community Eligibility Provision.""Records show that Tusk Philanthropies has hired lobbyists in the past to try to fight for their priorities. The group's website lists fighting child hunger as one of its goals. The site says the group has been ""able to help pass legislation in Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Arizona, California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington state.""Former presidential contender and New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang launched a nonprofit called Humanity Forward after he dropped out of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. The 501(c)(4) recently hired Puccio to focus on the child tax credit, according to the registration form. Puccio registered to lobby for the Yang backed group in early December.The expansion of the child tax credit was a major feature of Biden's social spending proposal that has since stalled largely due to Manchin's opposition.The group's website says that the organization has been actively working to expand the provision as it is set to expire.""Humanity Forward worked with partner organizations and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to pass the expanded monthly Child Tax Credit payments as part of the American Rescue Plan Act and is actively advancing efforts to prevent its expiration in December 2021,"" the website says.

Borg, Alabama Securities Commission Director.The annual survey of North American securities regulators urged investors to exercise caution before purchasing popular and volatile unregulated investments, especially those involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.""The most common telltale sign of an investment scam is an offer of guaranteed high returns with no risk. It is important for investors to understand what they are investing in and with whom they are investing,"" said Melanie Senter Lubin, NASAA President and Maryland Securities Commissioner.""Education and information are an investor's best defense against investment fraud,"" continued Lubin.The report added that digital assets ""do not fall neatly into the existing investor regulatory framework,"" so it may be easier for promoters of these products ""to fleece the public."" ""Before you jump into the crypto craze, be mindful that cryptocurrencies and related financial products may be nothing more than public facing fronts for Ponzi schemes and other frauds,"" said Enforcement Section Committee Vice-Chair Joseph Rotunda.Rotunda added that investments in cryptocurrency trading programs, interests in crypto mining pools, crypto depository accounts and securitized tokens should ""be seen for what they are: extremely risky speculation with a high risk of loss.""Scammers took home a record $14 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021, thanks in large part to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.DeFi is a rapidly growing sector of the crypto market that aims to cut out middlemen, such as banks, from traditional financial transactions, like securing a loan, by using blockchain technology.Losses from crypto-related crime rose 79% from a year earlier, driven by a spike in theft and scams.Scamming was the greatest form of cryptocurrency-based crime in 2021, followed by theft — most of which occurred through hacking of cryptocurrency businesses. Chainalysis says that DeFi is a big part of the story for both, in yet another warning for those dabbling in this emerging segment of the crypto industry.NASAA noted that many of the fraud threats facing investors today involve private offerings, which are exempted from federal law registration requirements. States are also preempted from enforcing investor protection laws related to these private securities.""Unregistered private offerings generally are high-risk investments and don't have the same investor protection requirements as those sold through public markets,"" said Borg.Ultimately, state securities regulators say that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.Some DeFi platforms, for example, offer users huge returns, such as high-interest rate savings and lending products.Bad actors often entice new investors by promising the payment of safe, lucrative, guaranteed returns over relatively short terms – ""sometimes measured in hours or days instead of months or years,"" according to NASAA, which says these kinds of promises are a red flag for fraud.Fraud offerings tied to promissory notes, money scams offered online and via social media, as well as financial schemes connected to self-directed Individual Retirement Accounts rounded out the survey's list of the top threats to retail investors."
2022-01-12,"New documents show that in 2019 Jared Kushner was quietly advocating for a U.S. digital dollar, according to a 250-page dump of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's crypto-related e-mail correspondence from his four years in the job.Kushner's apparent affinity for digital currencies is one of many revelations gleaned from this newly released document that was obtained by CoinDesk through a Freedom of Information Act request.Other insights include details surrounding the fight between the crypto lobby and Mnuchin over the Treasury Department’s last-minute attempt at rolling out new rules pertaining to user-controlled digital wallets. New documents show that one of former President Donald Trump's most trusted and senior advisors was secretly pushing the White House to lean into crypto, well before skyrocketing crypto prices reignited mainstream interest in the space.In 2019, when crypto was in the midst of a multiyear bear market, Jared Kushner — Trump's son-in-law and a senior adviser — was quietly advocating for a U.S. digital dollar, in which the Fed would launch its own central bank currency.The information was gleaned from a 250-page dump of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's crypto-related e-mail correspondence from his four years in the job, which was was obtained by CoinDesk through a Freedom of Information Act request.Other insights include details surrounding the fight between the crypto lobby and Mnuchin over the Treasury Department's last-minute attempt at rolling out new rules pertaining to user-controlled digital wallets.Neither Mnuchin nor Kushner immediately responded to CNBC's request for comment about their crypto-related email exchanges. On May 29, 2019, Kushner, who was more known for his work on the administration's foreign-policy efforts rather than fiscal matters, sent an e-mail to Mnuchin to suggest that a group be assembled to ""have a brainstorm"" about the topic of a U.S. digital currency.The note included a link to a blog post by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in which Altman argues that while the U.S. government cannot stop cryptocurrency, it can ""create the winner."" In the post, Altman riffed on a hypothetical U.S. digital currency, or USDC, which would function as a second legal currency. He goes on to say that if the U.S. was the first superpower government to launch a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, it would have an ""enviable position in the future of the world"" and exercise some degree of power over a worldwide currency.""My sense is it could make sense and also be something that could ultimately change the way we pay out entitlements as well saving us a ton in waste fraud and also in transaction costs,"" Kushner wrote.There was no reply from Mnuchin among the documents, so it is unclear whether the Treasury secretary took any action.Kushner's view on the CBDC phenomenon ultimately proved prescient.Few countries were seriously dabbling in national digital currencies in mid-2019, but today, at least 87 countries representing over 90% of global GDP are exploring a CBDC, according to research from the Atlantic Council.China is miles ahead of the rest of the world, having spent years developing and piloting its digital yuan. Beijing is currently in the process of ramping up efforts to roll out the so-called e-CNY to the broader population, with the ultimate goal of replacing cash and coins already in circulation.In the years since Kushner floated the idea of a digital dollar, talk of a CBDC in the U.S. has circulated among regulators and lawmakers, though with few tangible steps toward implementation.During a two-day congressional hearing in July, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the main incentive for the U.S. to launch its own CBDC would be to eliminate the case for crypto coins in America.""You wouldn't need stablecoins; you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies, if you had a digital U.S. currency,"" Powell said. ""I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""America's most likely path on CBDC would be to create a digital twin of the dollar, observers say. It would be fully regulated, under a central authority, and with the full faith and backing of the country's central bank.""A dollar in CBDC form is a liability of the central bank. The Federal Reserve has to pay you back,"" explained Ronit Ghose, who heads FinTech and digital assets for Citi Global Insights.Though former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo has since taken up the cause for a digital dollar, the full commitment of the Fed remains in doubt. Powell previously told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that he was not convinced that the benefits outweigh the costs. Before Giancarlo began spearheading the so-called Digital Dollar Project, the former CFTC chairman was among those addressing Mnuchin on the crypto topic.An e-mail exchange from July 2018 shows that Giancarlo, via his executive assistant, was adamant about setting up time for an in-person meeting with the Treasury secretary.When CNBC asked about the White House meeting, Giancarlo said he could not recall that specific request, but added that throughout 2018, he ""routinely apprised Secretary Mnuchin of ongoing operation and supervision of the bitcoin futures market launched under CFTC oversight in December 2017.""   Giancarlo also told CNBC that it was ""quite likely"" that he had informed Mnuchin about his growing concerns surrounding the potential adverse impact of a ""Hard Brexit"" on London-based swaps clearing under the joint supervision of the CFTC and the Bank of England. Mnuchin's office expressed interest in some other countries' crypto plans as well, according to the new documents.In Sept. 2019, Mnuchin's team seemed particularly interested in Venezuela's announcement that it would use cryptocurrencies as a way to facilitate free national and international payments. The move could have helped the Venezuelan government circumvent U.S. sanctions, which had largely isolated the state from the global economy.Monica Crowley, then the Treasury's assistant secretary for public affairs, sent off a Bloomberg News headline via email to Mnuchin that read, ""Maduro says Venezuela to activate crypto payment method 'soon,' "" to which the Treasury chief replied, ""Let's discuss."" In his final months at Treasury, Mnuchin apparently argued with the blockchain lobby over his plan to impose new rules on user-hosted cryptocurrency wallets.Part of the problem had to do with concerns over privacy and the difficulty of fully meeting compliance requirements. The proposal would have required crypto exchanges to collect counterparty information, including names and addresses, from those looking to send or receive crypto from a self-hosted wallet.The timing was also rushed.The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, proposed the rule a week before Christmas 2020, after Joe Biden had been elected as the next president but before he took office. Although this deadline was extended multiple times, FinCEN initially offered only a 15-day public comment window on the proposal. Typically, comment periods run 30 to 90 days.The Blockchain Association, which had reached out to Mnuchin a month before the proposal was formally put forth, enlisted the help of an attorney. Kirkland & Ellis lawyer Paul Clement wrote a letter to Mnuchin on the association's behalf, saying that ""the notion that stakeholders could meaningfully engage with a rule that touches on more than 24 separate subjects in such a highly truncated period would be doubtful even in the ordinary course.""Clement warned, ""Thus, what purports to be just a reporting requirement may well operate as a de facto ban,"" according to the documents.The Blockchain Association wasn't alone in urging Mnuchin to re-think the new crypto rule. Correspondence shows that others suggested he lose the counterparty disclosure requirement. Ultimately, nothing came of the proposal."
2022-01-12,"A class action lawsuit accuses Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather of artificially inflating the price of the cryptocurrency EthereumMax.The celebrities made ""false or misleading statements"" about the little-known token in social media posts, the lawsuit claims.EthereumMax has lost around 97% of its value since early June, leading some investors to label it as a ""pump and dump"" scheme. Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather are being sued over allegations they misled investors when promoting a little-known cryptocurrency called EthereumMax to their millions of social media followers.A class action lawsuit filed last Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California accuses EthereumMax and its celebrity promoters of working together to artificially inflate the price of the token by making ""false or misleading statements"" in social media posts.Kardashian caused a stir last year when she made an Instagram post promoting the EthereumMax token. ""Are you guys into crypto????"" Kardashian wrote. ""This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends just told me about the Ethereum Max token!""Kardashian included the hashtag #ad in the message, suggesting she was paid to promote it. It's not clear how much Kardashian was paid by EthereumMax, though estimates have placed her fee per sponsored Instagram post in the $500,000 to $1 million range.Meanwhile, Mayweather endorsed the token in his boxing match with YouTube star Logan Paul. EthereumMax was accepted as payment for tickets to the event, a move the lawsuit claims boosted trading volumes sharply.Mayweather also promoted EthereumMax at a major bitcoin conference in Miami, and was subsequently booed off stage. Mayweather doesn't appear to have disclosed payment for his promotion of the token, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit claims that plaintiff Ryan Huegerich, a New York resident, and other investors who purchased EthereumMax tokens between May 14, 2021, and June 17, 2021, suffered losses as a result of the celebrities' conduct.EthereumMax has lost around 97% of its value since early June, leading some investors to label it as a ""pump and dump"" scheme where scammers attempt to boost the price of an asset through false or misleading statements. The accusation features in Huegerich's lawsuit, which accuses Kardashian and Mayweather of ""shilling"" EthereumMax.EthereumMax ""has no connection"" to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, the lawsuit said, adding its branding appears to be an effort to mislead investors into believing the token is part of the Ethereum network.Representatives for Kardashian and Mayweather were not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

""We dispute the allegations and look forward to the truth coming out.""It's not the first time celebrities have been in hot water for cryptocurrency endorsements — much to the ire of regulators.In 2018, Mayweather was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with pumping an initial coin offering, a controversial crypto crowdfunding method. Mayweather paid over $600,000 in a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the regulator's findings.In September 2021, Charles Randell, chair of the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, singled out Kardashian's Instagram ad for EthereumMax in a speech warning about crypto scams. Randell said that while he couldn't say if EthereumMax specifically was a scam, ""social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation."""
2022-01-12,"Real estate in virtual worlds — sometimes called the metaverse — is going for millions of dollars in some cases.The most expensive spots are near where lots of users congregate — for instance, someone recently paid $450,000 to be Snoop Dogg's neighbor in a virtual world called the Sandbox.But even proponents are warning would-be investors that this is risky business. It's no secret the real estate market is skyrocketing, but the Covid pandemic is creating another little-known land rush. Indeed, some investors are paying millions for plots of land — not in New York or Beverly Hills. In fact, the plots do not physically exist here on Earth.Rather, the land is located online, in a set of virtual worlds that tech insiders have dubbed the metaverse. Prices for plots have soared as much as 500% in the last few months ever since Facebook announced it was going all-in on virtual reality, even changing its corporate name to Meta Platforms.""The metaverse is the next iteration of social media,"" said Andrew Kiguel, CEO of Toronto-based Tokens.com, which invests in metaverse real estate and non fungible token-related digital assets.  ""You can go to a carnival, you can go to a music concert, you can go to a museum,"" Kiguel said. In these virtual worlds, real people interact as cartoon-like characters called avatars, similar to a real-time multiplayer video game. Today, people can access these worlds through a normal computer screen, but Meta and other companies have a long-term vision of building 360-degree immersive worlds, which people will access through virtual reality goggles like Meta's Oculus.A recent report by crypto asset manager Grayscale estimates the digital world may grow into a $1 trillion business in the near future. Here, major artists, including Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and DJ Marshmello, are performing as their own avatars. Even Paris Hilton DJ'ed a New Year's Eve party on her own virtual island.Kiguel's company recently dropped nearly $2.5 million on a patch of land in Decentraland — one of several popular metaverse worlds. ""Prices have gone up 400% to 500% in the last few months,"" Kiguel said.Another hot metaverse world is the Sandbox, where Janine Yorio's virtual real estate development company, Republic Realm, spent a record $4.3 million on a parcel of virtual land.  Yorio tells CNBC her company sold 100 virtual private islands last year for $15,000 each. ""Today, they're selling for about $300,000 each, which is coincidentally the same as the average home price in America,"" she said. ""The digital world, to some, is as important as the real world,"" Miami-based real estate broker Oren Alexander tells CNBC. ""It's not about what you and I believe in, but it's about what the future does.""Just like property in the real world, Kiguel says the metaverse is about three things: location, location, location.""There are areas when you first go into the metaverse where people congregate — those areas would certainly be a lot more valuable than the areas that don't have any events going on,"" Kiguel said.To be sure, those heavily trafficked areas are reeling in big spenders.""Think about the board game Monopoly. We just bought Boardwalk and the surrounding area,"" Kiguel said. ""Areas where people congregate are far more valuable for advertisers and retailers to find ways to get in there to access that demographic.""For example, Snoop Dogg is building a virtual mansion on a plot of land in Sandbox, and someone recently paid $450,000 to be his neighbor. ""I think it absolutely matters who your neighbor is,"" said Yorio. ""That's kind of true of almost anything, right? It's like a club and you want to be around people that share similar interests.""Buying virtual land is pretty simple — either directly from the platform or through a developer. Investors build on their land and make it interactive. ""You can decorate it, you can change it, you can renovate,"" Yorio says. ""It's code.""But Yorio cautions that investing in digital real estate is risky business.""[It's] highly, highly risky. You should only invest capital that you're prepared to lose,"" Yorio tells CNBC. ""It's highly speculative. It's also blockchain-based. And as we all know, crypto is highly volatile. But it can also be massively rewarding.""Mark Stapp, professor and director for real estate theory and practice at Arizona State University, agrees. ""I would not put money into this that I didn't care about losing. I certainly wouldn't,"" Stapp says. ""If it continues the way it's going, it is most likely going to be a bubble. You're buying something that isn't tied to reality."""

Jack Dorsey's payments company Block (formerly Square) is going to start mining for bitcoin.In a string of tweets, Block's general manager for hardware, Thomas Templeton, laid out the company's plans for next steps.Templeton says the goal is to make bitcoin mining — the process of creating new bitcoins by solving increasingly complex computational problems — more distributed and efficient in every way, ""from buying, to set up, to maintenance, to mining.""The idea of making the mining process more accessible has to do with more than just creating new bitcoin, according to Templeton. Instead, he says the company sees it as a long-term need for a future that is fully decentralized and permissionless.""Mining needs to be more distributed,"" Dorsey wrote in a tweet in October, when he first floated the idea. ""The more decentralized this is, the more resilient the bitcoin network becomes."" Toward that end, the company is solving one major barrier to entry: Mining rigs are hard to find, expensive, and delivery can be unpredictable. Block says it is open to making a new ASIC, which is the specialized gear use to mine for bitcoin.The project is being incubated within Block's hardware team, which is beginning to build out a core engineering team of system, ASIC, and software designers led by Afshin Rezayee. In terms of the hardware, Dorsey previously tweeted that the company was considering a ""bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon."" Dorsey went on to share his thoughts on the need for more of a focus on vertical integration, as well as on silicon design, which he says is too concentrated among a few companies.Templeton writes that Block also looking to improve reliability and the user experience of mining.""Common issues we've heard with current systems are around heat dissipation and dust. They also become non-functional almost every day, which requires a time-consuming reboot. We want to build something that just works,"" Templeton tweeted. ""They're also very noisy, which makes them too loud for home use.""Democratizing access to bitcoin mining is a big part of the mission statement of this project.""Mining isn't accessible to everyone,"" wrote Dorsey in October. ""Bitcoin mining should be as easy as plugging a rig into a power source. There isn't enough incentive today for individuals to overcome the complexity of running a miner for themselves."" The announcement from Block comes just a few months after the U.S. eclipsed China for the first time ever as the world's top destination for bitcoin miners. The U.S. is also flush with renewable power sources.Washington State is a mecca for hydropowered mining farms. New York produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains, and it counts its nuclear power plants toward its 100% carbon-free electricity goal. Meanwhile, Texas' share of renewables is growing over time, with 20% of its power coming from wind as of 2019. The Texas grid also continues to rapidly add more wind and solar power.Texas also has a deregulated power grid with real-time spot pricing that lets customers choose between power providers, and crucially, its political leaders are pro-crypto. Those are dream conditions for miners who want a kind welcome and cheap energy sources.""If you're looking to relocate hundreds of millions of dollars of miners out of China, you want to make sure you have geographic, political, and jurisdictional stability. You also want to make sure there are private property rights protections for the assets that you are relocating,"" said Darin Feinstein, co-founder of cryptocurrency mining operator Core Scientific. "

Gemini, the $7.1 billion crypto exchange, is getting into wealth management with the acquisition of a digital asset platform for financial advisors, CNBC has learned exclusively.The company has agreed to purchase BITRIA, a five-year-old San Francisco-based start-up whose tools help advisors manage holdings of bitcoin and other tokens, according to Gemini's global head of business development Dave Abner.The move creates one of the industry's first full-service digital asset custodians for advisors, according to Abner, who declined to disclose how much Gemini paid in the deal. Gemini intends to combine its crypto custody and exchange capabilities with BITRIA's portfolio management programs, allowing advisors to do things like tax-loss harvesting, he said.""Advisors manage the biggest pool of money in the country right now, and they're hearing from their clients that want access to crypto,"" Abner said this week in a phone interview. ""This creates a one-stop, end-to-end experience for advisors to manage all of their clients' digital assets within their traditional portfolio management systems.""Crypto insiders have forecast a boom in mergers this year as a cohort of newly flush digital asset giants like Gemini and Coinbase look to acquire capabilities and expand offerings. Just yesterday, Coinbase announced it was buying Chicago-based FairX so that it could offer derivatives to retail and institutional customers.Though crypto started more than a decade ago as a retail investor-led phenomenon, the rise of bitcoin, ethereum and other coins in the past two years has enticed bigger investors into the space. That's created the need for ways to provide wealthy investors access to crypto through familiar wealth management vehicles like separately managed accounts.""Nobody else in the crypto space is looking at servicing the wealth management community the way that Gemini is,"" Abner said. ""We're already the largest service provider to crypto ETFs globally. Now we are moving into the wealth space, and we're going to be the only pure-play full service provider of crypto assets"" to advisors. BITRIA, which changed its name from Blockchange in November, is one of a small handful of crypto companies that have sprung up to service financial advisors. Competitors include Onramp Invest and Eaglebrook Advisors. The broader financial advisor industry's assets have surged along with booming equities markets, topping $110 trillion during the pandemic.Gemini, founded in 2014 by Winklevoss twins Tyler and Cameron, was valued at $7.1 billion in a November funding round. Ballooning valuations in the industry have left companies flush with cash and with mandates to ramp up growth.The acquisition followed a partnership between the two firms announced in 2020. BITRIA's employees, including co-founder and CEO Daniel Eyre, are joining Gemini, the companies said.""The future of wealth management lies in digital assets and blockchain technology and the integration of BITRIA's technology with Gemini provides a bridge to that future,"" Eyre said in a statement."
2022-01-13,"Block founder and CEO Jack Dorsey just confirmed that the company, formerly known as Square, plans to move forward with plans to build a bitcoin mining system.""We're officially building an open bitcoin mining system,"" Dorsey tweeted on Thursday. The company first announced that it was considering the project in October.The project's goal is to make mining bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, ""more distributed and efficient,"" tweeted Thomas Templeton, the company's general manager for hardware.Bitcoin operates on a proof of work (PoW) model, where miners must compete to solve complex puzzles in order to validate transactions. The process isn't easy: It requires a lot of energy and computer power, which isn't cheap. The computers themselves, along with other equipment, can also be very expensive.Templeton mentioned that there are a number of ""customer pain points"" and ""technical challenges"" in the mining community that Block hopes to address, including mining rig availability, high price, reliability and power consumption.""For most people, mining rigs are hard to find. Once you've managed to track them down, they're expensive and delivery can be unpredictable,"" Templeton tweeted. ""How can we make it so that anyone, anywhere, can easily purchase a mining rig?"" he said. ""We want to build something that just works. What can we simplify to make this a reality?""Templeton said that Block is developing a hardware team of engineers and software designers to assess these questions. ""Developing products is never a solo journey, and evaluating existing tech is always part of our practice,"" he said.This announcement isn't surprising. After all, it's no secret that Dorsey loves and owns bitcoin.Before floating the idea of Block (then Square) building a mining system in October, Dorsey also said in August that he's ""trying"" to mine bitcoin himself.""Mining isn't accessible to everyone,"" Dorsey tweeted in October.

2022-01-14,"Billionaire Mark Cuban is mostly investing in cryptocurrency nowadays.""The investments I'm making now are not in traditional businesses,"" Cuban said on a recent episode of ""The Problem With Jon Stewart"" podcast. In fact, ""80% of the investments that I make that are not on 'Shark Tank' are in or around cryptocurrencies.""One type of organization in particular has captured Cuban's attention: decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. ""That is really where I look to invest,"" he said.In theory, a DAO is a blockchain-based collective that isn't governed by one person or entity. Any changes to the DAO's rules or governance must be voted on by its members. To gain these voting rights, as well as other powers within the organization, investors typically hold the DAO's governance tokens.""All these new businesses are being formulated now that take this new approach,"" Cuban, an investor on ABC's ""Shark Tank"" and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said. He added that there will be ""game-changing businesses"" that come from these types of organizations.In particular, he predicts that industries like banking and insurance are ""going to change,"" thanks to these new technologies.Cuban is also bullish on smart contracts, which are collections of code that carry out a set of instructions on the blockchain and power decentralized applications. Smart contracts are instrumental in forming DAOs, as well as in powering other crypto projects, such as decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs.But DAOs and their governance tokens can be risky bets for investors. Financial experts warn to only invest what you can afford to lose, since they deem cryptocurrency to be a volatile and speculative investment.Nonetheless, this positive outlook isn't particularly surprising from Cuban, who has consistently been outspoken about his belief in smart contracts. Cuban is an avid investor in the crypto space, with a cryptocurrency portfolio of various digital coins, NFTs and investments in many blockchain companies.But even Cuban is realistic about the burgeoning industry. He called the cryptocurrency space casino-like because it's still so new. ""It's like the early days of the internet,"" he told Stewart. ""The exact same thing is happening now. It's 1995 for cryptocurrencies.""""It's not to say there aren't a lot of problems,"" Cuban continued. Cryptocurrency ""is hard to understand and it's a hassle.

2022-01-14,"Company stocks and real estate will be among the many things that get turned into non-fungible tokens in the future, according to venture capitalist Bill Tai. The tech investor said that ""it's going to happen"" and it's ""not even a question.""NFTs are ""one-of-a-kind"" assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold over the internet. They're designed to show that someone has ownership of a unique virtual item, such as online pictures and videos, or even sports trading cards. Company stocks and real estate will be among the many things that get turned into non-fungible tokens in the future, according to venture capitalist Bill Tai.The tech investor told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal on Wednesday that ""it's going to happen"" and it's ""not even a question.""Instead, it is simply a matter of when it will happen at scale, Tai said at the Crypto Finance Conference in St. Moritz, Switzerland.NFTs are ""one-of-a-kind"" assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold over the internet. They're designed to show that someone has ownership of a unique virtual item, such as online pictures and videos or even sports trading cards. It's currently unclear why anyone would want to own an NFT of a stock or what they would be able to do with it.Over the last year, the number of items being turned into NFTs has grown rapidly. Everything from the source code of the world wide web to Jack Dorsey's first tweet has been sold as NFTs.But some people are confused as to why these non-tangible assets are being sold for so much money. In March, South Carolina-based graphic designer Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, sold an NFT for a record $69 million at a Christie's auction. In June, an NFT of the web’s source code sold for $5.4 million.Data from market tracker DappRadar published Tuesday shows total NFT sales hit $25 billion in 2021 as the speculative crypto-asset boomed in popularity. Some of the world's best-known companies including Coca-Cola and Gucci have also sold NFTs. While some are concerned there's an NFT bubble, Tai, who has invested in start-ups like Zoom and Scribd, said he expects more and more things to be turned into NFTs as the internet moves from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.""Web 1.0 was read-only,"" he said. ""Web 2.0 is read-write. Web 3.0 is the instantiation of a wrapper around everything that's coming in and out of that screen so that it can move around. So it's an internet of assets.""""You can put land titles on there, real estate, art, drawings, anything,"" he added, explaining that everything can have an address that allows people to find it through a marketplace. ""It's the most efficient way over time to assign ownership of really any asset.""Like many other NFT advocates, Tai is also interested in cryptocurrencies. He described the latest crypto collapse that saw bitcoin's value briefly fall to less than $40,000 on Monday as ""yet another wobble"" but he's optimistic it will bounce back.""I don't know when it's going to go back up, but it's going to go back up,"" he said, adding that cryptocurrencies are at the crux of institutional acceptance.Elsewhere, Seba Bank CEO told CNBC that bitcoin's price could nearly double to $75,000 this year as more institutional investors start to embrace it.""Our internal valuation models indicate a price right now between $50,000 and $75,000,"" said the boss of the regulated Swiss bank which has a focus on cryptocurrencies. ""I'm quite confident we are going to see that level. The question is always timing."""
2022-01-14,"The Northwest Arkansas Council, a nonprofit organization, is offering remote tech professionals and entrepreneurs $10,000 in bitcoin to move to the region.Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is currently trading at around $42,893, according to Coin Metrics.Why bitcoin? ""Northwest Arkansas is experiencing explosive growth in the tech sector, specifically within blockchain-enabled technologies, and this incentive embraces the growing trend of cryptocurrency as a payment option by employers,"" its website reads.The incentive is part of the NWA Council's ""Life Works Here"" campaign, which is funded by the Walton Family Foundation. When it first launched in 2020, the NWA Council initially offered $10,000 cash as an incentive program. It recently decided to add the option for remote workers to accept the amount in bitcoin instead, although they can still choose cash if they prefer.""While we've had overwhelming interest in the initial incentive program, we're continuing to seek out unique and in-demand talent in the STEAM and blockchain professions,"" the website says.In order to be eligible, applicants must relocate to Northwest Arkansas, which includes Washington and Benton counties, within six months of acceptance to the program and sign a one-year lease or buy a home.Applicants also must be at least 24 years old, have at least two years of work experience, currently live outside of the state of Arkansas and be a U.S. citizen or have the credentials required to work legally in the U.S., according to the program's website.In addition to the money, the NWA Council is also offering to gift remote workers a bicycle, highlighting the region's mountain biking trails, or a free membership to local theaters and museums.So far, over 35,000 people have applied from more than 115 countries and 50 states, the NWA Council says.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: This 22-year-old earns $200,000 per year in Tulsa, Oklahoma—and saves around $11,000 a month"
2022-01-15,"The HIFO (short for highest in, first out) accounting method can significantly slash an investor's tax obligation.When you sell your crypto, you can pick and choose the specific unit you are selling. That means a crypto holder can pick out the most expensive bitcoin they bought and use that number to determine their tax obligation. A higher cost basis translates to less tax on your sale, because with capital gains, the equation is your sales price minus the cost basis. Bitcoin is down around 36% from its all-time high in November, but the dip has a good side, thanks to a quirk in the tax code that helps crypto holders shield their winnings from the IRS.The IRS treats cryptocurrencies like property, meaning that anytime you spend, exchange, or sell your tokens, you're logging a taxable event. There's always a difference between how much you paid for your crypto, which is the cost basis, and the market value at the time you spend it. That difference can trigger capital gains taxes.But a little-known accounting method known as HIFO — short for highest in, first out — can significantly slash an investor's tax obligation.When you sell your crypto, you can pick and choose the specific unit you are selling. That means a crypto holder can pick out the most expensive bitcoin they bought and use that number to determine their tax obligation. A higher cost basis translates to less tax on your sale.But the onus is on the user to keep track, so thorough bookkeeping is essential. Without detailed records of a taxpayer's transaction and cost basis, calculations to the IRS can't be substantiated.""People rarely use it because it requires keeping good records or using crypto software,"" explained Shehan Chandrasekera, a CPA and head of tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io. ""But the thing is, lots of folks now use that kind of software, which makes this kind of accounting super easy. They just don't know it exists.""The trick to HIFO accounting is keeping granular details about every crypto transaction you made for each coin you own, including when you purchased it and for how much, as well as when you sold it and the market value at that time.But if you don't have all transaction records logged, or you're not using the right kind of software, the accounting method defaults to something called FIFO, or first in, first out.""It's not ideal,"" Chandrasekera explains.Under FIFO accounting rules, when you sell your tokens, you're selling the earliest purchased coin. If you bought your crypto before its big price run-up in 2021, your low cost basis can mean a bigger capital gains tax bill. Pairing HIFO accounting with the wash sale rule has the potential to save taxpayers even more money, experts tell CNBC.Because the IRS classifies digital currencies like bitcoin as property, losses on crypto holdings are treated differently than losses on stocks and mutual funds, according to Onramp Invest CEO Tyrone Ross. In particular, wash sale rules don't apply, meaning that you can sell your bitcoin and buy it right back, whereas with a stock, you would have to wait 30 days to buy it back.This nuance in the tax code paves the way for aggressive tax-loss harvesting, where investors sell at a loss and buy back bitcoin at a lower price. Those losses can lower your tax bill or be used to offset future gains.For instance, say a taxpayer purchases one bitcoin for $10,000 and sells it for $50,000. This individual would face $40,000 of taxable capital gains. But if this same taxpayer had previously harvested $40,000 worth of losses on earlier crypto transactions, they'd be able to offset the tax they owe.""You want to look as poor as possible,"" explained Chandrasekera.Chandrasekera says he sees people doing this on a weekly to quarterly basis, depending on their sophistication.Quickly buying back the cryptos is another key part of the equation. If timed correctly, buying the dip enables investors to catch the ride back up, if the price of the digital coin rebounds."
2022-01-15,"New job creation will be taking place inside the metaverse in 2022, from developers working on gaming and NFT transactions for luxury brands and social media platforms, to gamers monetizing their skills.The venture capital community will continue to make investments that bridge the world of gaming and the metaverse economy.A new global infrastructure based on massive computing power needs should support leading chipmakers like Nvidia and Intel. If 2021's word of the year was ""NFT,"" Avery Akkineni says 2022's will be ""Web 3.0.""As president of VaynerNFT, Akkineni spends much of her time consulting with brands looking to get a piece of the metaverse action. The notion of a ""corporate metaverse strategy"" is new — VaynerNFT itself was founded less than 6 months ago — but it's building momentum. The company's first client was Budweiser, and Akkineni foresees plenty of other major brands following its lead. In fact, the baseline, widely agreed-upon prediction for 2022: more major brands will get involved in Web3 projects. ""2022 will be the year major brands embrace NFTs in a big way,"" says Lin Dai, CEO of music NFT platform OneOf. The Quincy Jones-backed start-up is behind the near $1 million auction for an NFT of a never-before-heard Whitney Houston song, and has collaborated with The Recording Academy for an exclusive Grammy Awards partnership. But this year, digital assets built on the blockchain will likely continue to expand well beyond the music and art industries.Luxury fashion brand Balenciaga has already teamed up with Fortnite to deliver to users designer ""skins"" to wear inside the game. Gucci has done the same with Roblox, and Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren have launched their own Roblox experiences. Brian Trunzo, metaverse Lead at Polygon Studios, which focuses on gaming, NFTs and Web3 efforts linked to the polygon digital currency and ethereum blockchain network, says nimble, smart streetwear brands are already in the space as well. ""The players have finally taken the field, and the game is about to truly start,"" Trunzo said. Akkineni says that the focus for brands, at least at this point, isn't to win but simply to get involved. So far, brand engagement with blockchain projects has been about building community and staying relevant. The Nike and Adidas NFT drops, for example, generated more buzz than cash, but they lent legitimacy to a still-nascent space. More direct commercialization strategies could be coming. Cathy Hackl, CEO and chief metaverse officer for the Futures Intelligence Group, a metaverse consultant, points out that for luxury brands in particular, the metaverse could be an access point for a secondary market. ""When someone sells their Birkin bag on The RealReal, Hermes does not see a cut of that. But through blockchain and NFTs, they are eventually going to get a cut of the secondary market,"" Hackl said.  As more companies seek a foothold in the digital universe, hiring opportunities for candidates comfortable with Web3 will grow. Hackl says her title may become more common.""Even if you look at job boards, you're increasingly seeing demand for Solidity developers and Discord managers,"" Akkineni said.Solidity is a computer language used in conjunction with the ethereum blockchain to build and deploy smart contracts. Discord is a social media platform favored by many gamers and the crypto community.Big brands will naturally help drive Web3 job creation, but a new kind of employment might take center stage. The play-to-earn gaming model gained popularity in the Philippines with Axie Infinity four years ago, and now the game has over 1.8 million daily active users, some reporting an income of about $10 a day, and up to $1,000-$2,000 a month from solely playing the game.""It's kind of like a universal basic income experiment mixed with an e-sport,"" says Vance Spencer, a DeFi venture capitalist and co-founder of Framework Ventures.   There has been controversy within the gaming world about virtual monetization, but the math that supports more investments linking the metaverse to gaming is simple, according to Spencer.Gaming is the biggest segment of the entertainment industry, with nearly 3 billion regular participants. Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity's developer, was the first to monetize NFTs in a gaming environment, but it won't be the last. Investors are recognizing the potential in crypto-gaming crossover. In October, Sky Mavis raised $152 million from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Cuban. Developers looking to do the same are likely to be successful, although for Spencer, the most upside is for developers making AAA-quality games that can be played on PC, like Take-Two Interactive's Grand Theft Auto and EA's FIFA. Roblox, though, and even Minecraft, have found substantial success despite not being AAA games.GameStop is making the same bet, announcing plans to launch its own NFT marketplace. It's likely that GME will need to make a slew of Web3 hires to execute the plan. Brands are likely to tap into the gaming revenue streams, too.""There's a direct commercialization opportunity in the gaming space. … People are very used to paying $20, $50, $100 per skin,"" Akkineni said.And gamers are indeed willing to shell out for their virtual avatars: the digital version of Gucci's Dionysus bag sold on Roblox for more than the bag's IRL retail price.  The bigger the corporate plans for the digital world, the more computing power we'll need. As more brands leverage NFTs to build their communities in virtual worlds and as more consumers follow them in, technological and physical infrastructure moves into the foreground of the metaverse landscape. At the end of 2021, Intel estimated that Web3 metaverse projects will eventually demand at least 1000x the computing power we have now.   Another prediction for 2022: advancements in infrastructure. ""The amount of concurrent users online within a single server or 'node' in all virtual worlds will continue to increase,"" Trunzo said, and with that, advancements in the physical components to make the kind of consistent traffic possible and reliable. It's a natural and necessary part of tech's maturation, and it keeps the semiconductor mainstays like Intel and Nvidia in a solid position, whatever becomes of the metaverse.  The world of NFTs and blockchain-based digital assets is, for now, a hot one. But winter could be coming. Akinneni said, as demand will likely cool off and by the end of 2022, we may find fewer projects and fewer drops.""This probably won't be the year where we have a 90% drawdown in teams that are working on projects, but this will be the start of the end of the beginning,"" Spencer said.Not every blockchain project has the team to push it into the mainstream, and Spencer expects a maturation shift, and healthy consolidation. This consolidation could emerge in legacy brand M&A strategies. Akkineni points to Nike's acquisition of RTFKT as a pivotal moment in blockchain legitimacy beyond the crypto-native crowd. For big Fortune 50 or Fortune 500 brands, it's not too early to consider making similar deals, Hackl said.The biggest hurdles for the digital worlds of 2022 are scalability, in the form of computing power and interoperability between discrete metaverses, and security. Both of which, Akkineni points out, are typical for emerging technologies.  "
2022-01-15,"CNBC sports business reporter Jabari Young experienced the Jan. 10 NBA courtside game between the Celtics and Pacers on the Oculus 2 headset.Here's what Young thinks about watching basketball in virtual reality, and what you should know about it. Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka popped up from the team bench, and before I knew it, he was blocking my view. Indiana Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was close enough for me to see his Cole Haan shoes, and I saw a Lance Stephenson 3-pointer from an angle I'd never seen before.That's just some of my recent experience watching an NBA game while wearing a virtual reality headset.The National Basketball Association is offering virtual courtside seats on Meta's $299 Oculus Quest 2 devices. The headsets were one of the most popular Christmas gifts in 2021, showing that people seem to be more willing than ever to give virtual reality a try. And businesses are trying to keep your eyeballs on their content by creating VR versions of their apps and games. The NBA experience is free and available on Meta's Horizon Venues platform, which is a free software download for the Oculus headset. People appear as digital avatars, sort of like cartoon versions of their real selves, and watch an NBA game from a courtside perspective. It's not Jack Nicholson's Los Angeles Lakers seat at Crypto.com Arena or Spike Lee's seat at Madison Square Garden, but it almost replicates the real thing.From a business perspective, the deal could give the NBA a new set of media rights, which is important as regional sports networks struggle.Meanwhile, Meta — the company formerly known as Facebook — is using the partnership with sports providers including the NBA, WWE and Premier League to give people new reasons to try virtual reality.Mark Zuckerberg's company is making a $10 billion investment in the metaverse, a virtual world he believes will become the standard for social networking, gaming and even work.Meta sent CNBC the Oculus 2 headset last month. I experienced the Jan. 10 NBA courtside game between the Celtics and Pacers. Here's what you need to know. First, you should know you're prohibited from watching if you live in the market where an NBA game is being broadcast on TV. The NBA uses RSN feeds from its League Pass product, and local markets are subject to the same annoying restrictions you run into elsewhere.Once you get in the game, you'll instantly notice other avatars engaging in live discussions. The closeness of the action grabs your attention, too. It's here that you get immersed in the experience, as it actually feels a lot like being in a courtside seat, right down to the engagement with nearby fans.There are two levels in the digital room where you can watch the game. The first level is usually where the crowd watches while chatting, and on this night, I counted about 15 people in the room during the first quarter.The balcony level is quieter for a more private setting, and the view is fine.Don't be afraid to spark up a conversation with an avatar whose microphone is on, especially if you need help navigating the room, which looks like two levels of a private social club.As the Celtics were up 23-18 in the first quarter, one avatar approached me to ask for assistance on watching. I was confused at first, as my stream was fine, but it became clear the real person behind the avatar had a bad connection or was restricted due to local blackout rules.That prompted him to label the NBA's metaverse experience ""trash."" Moments later, I asked another avatar standing next to me what he thought of the experience.""This is dope,"" responded the avatar named ""TUtley."" ""They need to get this for football.""The scenic views of Boston that appeared during game breaks were pretty impressive, too, and gave me a sense of being in the city where the game is played. ""Yo, man! Are you alright,"" I overheard one avatar asking another.The avatar in question was slumped over and unresponsive. It almost appeared the metaverse figure was having a seizure. The avatar eventually regained his form and started talking, but that glitch was certainly weird.The controllers are your hands in the metaverse, so it can be weird seeing nearby avatars with their hands and arms looking misaligned with their bodies.In the fourth quarter, Stephenson nailed a 3-pointer, and Pacers forward Torrey Craig then converted a layup to cut the Celtics lead to three, 71-68.Witnessing the close sequence was fun, but the relatively poor picture quality eventually became noticeable. TV and video providers have spoiled viewers with high-definition games. So, any slight difference in quality is quickly noticeable.The NBA works with VR production company Media Monks to show the games on the Oculus platform. During the NBA's pandemic ""bubble"" season in Orlando, the firm used Sony's FX6 cameras, which cost roughly $6,000, to shoot VR games. This season, though, games are being shot with Sony FX9 cameras, which cost about $11,000.But Meta frequently experiments with resolution and frame rates of the VR games, which are still technically in ""beta,"" or testing mode. Media Monks places five cameras in NBA arenas but added a sixth for the Celtics-Pacers game to capture a sense of space.One FX9 camera is at the announcer's table, offering the front row view. FX9 cameras are also on each backboard. One is used to capture far shots and another for roving. The cameras switch angles during the game, which can be annoying but necessary when coaches accidentally block the view. Udoka's leg was in my face every time he walked to center court, for example.The featured moderator is former NBA forward Richard Jefferson, but the commentating is dull at times. And the trivia questions don't help.Meta uses former NBA players such as Jefferson to interact with avatars attending the courtside experience. And in some contests, commentators could appear in the room as actual avatars to chat with fans.We'll see how exciting that actually is when it happens. Finally, the selection of games could be better. Celtics-Pacers was fine, but marquee matches would be more appealing and might attract more people, making it an even more social experience.The next two NBA VR games on Oculus are scheduled for Jan. 17 — Covid postponements permitting — featuring the Oklahoma Thunder playing Mark Cuban's Dallas Mavericks. The Jan. 22 VR experience has the Sacramento Kings playing the NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks.Those aren't necessarily must-see games. I missed the overtime session of the Celtics-Pacers because my Oculus headset battery died. But, judging by how many people were on the first level late in the fourth quarter, with more coming in from the Venues lobby, it's fair to say the NBA VR experience was popular that night in the metaverse.Three days after attending the game, I spoke with Rob Shaw, Meta's director of sports leagues and media partnerships, to understand how much the courtside experience has advanced and where it's headed.Shaw was reminded of comments made to CNBC in 2020 when he said the NBA's Oculus concept was ""still at the early stage."" Shaw said the new Oculus Quest 2 and its distribution have made a big difference since then. He noted the device is lighter, has better visuals and is cheaper than its $399 sister device, making it more popular as a gift.""Now, we're in the foundational moments of building and learning the experience,"" said Shaw.I asked whether the NBA experience would stay free, and Shaw didn't rule it out.""I think the business model can be redefined,"" he explained. ""It's not necessarily going to have to be pay-per-view but an economy that can be built around the viewership experience.""He added that if the VR experience can truly evolve to mimic being courtside, ""I can see them wanting to put a price point on a ticket. But that's a decision to be made by the league and media company.""Ultimately, it's up to the NBA whether to charge consumers. The league didn't make an official available to CNBC to discuss it.  While the NBA remains silent on the matter, Meta is looking forward.Shaw envisions immersive VR ads and allowing users to purchase avatar jerseys from a metaverse NBA store. Then, for an extra fee, private live-screening options. There are ideas around a sports bar courtside seat experience and VIP options that include watching games with an NBA legend or celebrity.""I do think sponsorship can be redefined,"" Shaw said. ""The brand activation that is historically limited in-venue suddenly becomes more accessible and customizing to the metaverse.""— CNBC's Steve Kovach contributed to this article."
2022-01-16,"Bitcoin enthusiasts are flocking to Puerto Rico, thanks to tax breaks and an island lifestyle.As the community grows, it's attracting more newcomers from the states as well as curious locals.But not everybody's happy about the influx. In March 2021, crypto entrepreneur and investor David Johnston moved his parents, wife, three daughters, and company with him to Puerto Rico. The 36-year-old, who has been involved in the crypto ecosystem since 2012, says the decision to relocate from Austin was kind of a no-brainer. Beyond the fact that Puerto Rico offers a year-round tropical backdrop with picturesque beaches, the U.S. territory also has crypto-friendly policies, including huge tax breaks to those who spend at least 183 days on the island each year. Residents can keep ahold of their American passports while at the same time not having to pay any taxes on capital gains. It certainly helped seal the deal for Johnston, though for him, the bigger incentive was an overwhelming fear of missing out.""That's where all my friends are. I don't have one friend left in New York, and maybe the pandemic accelerated this, but every single one of them has moved to Puerto Rico,"" he said, noting that many of his California friends have also made the move.  Johnston tells CNBC that after seeing his friends and colleagues decamp, he went to check it out himself in early 2021.""I said, 'Wow, okay, I get it,'"" Johnston recalled of his first impression of the small island territory, whose circumference can be driven in half a day. ""The island has three million people…This is big enough to build a tech center.""Johnston says that Puerto Rico reminds him a lot of Austin in 2012. Back before Tesla, Samsung, and Apple helped turn the Texas capital into one of the country's hottest tech hubs, he says the city felt small. But similar to Puerto Rico today, Austin had a great energy and lots of passionate people moving there, which accelerated over time. So for Johnston, making the move to Puerto Rico feels a whole lot like getting in on the ground floor.""That's where my community is. That's where the people I know and love are going, and they're going there to build something cool. Something that helps everyday people, and that's what I love about open source. That's what I love about blockchain. It's open to everybody,"" he said.  Puerto Rico has fast become the new hot destination for the crypto contingent. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who told the New York Times she bought crypto ""at the right time,"" made the move from San Francisco to Puerto Rico last year, in part to hang with her ""crypto friends"" on the island. Controversial YouTube star and NFT investor Logan Paul set up shop there, as did crypto billionaire Brock Pierce, a child actor (of ""Mighty Ducks"" fame) turned 2020 indie presidential candidate. Meanwhile, Johnston says his whole office building is filling up with start-ups and crypto companies.""Pantera Capital (a crypto fund) is on the fifth floor and then there's a co-working space on the sixth floor. My company, DLTx, we took over the eighth floor, and NFT.com took over the twelfth floor. That's all happened in the last 12 months,"" Johnston tells CNBC.  Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProGoldman Sachs loves Uber, Meta and Amazon — and ranks them in order of preferenceBroadcom bolsters stock with new Apple deal. Here's why the experts like itHere are Cowen's top chip picks for an EV and autonomous-auto future Goldman Sachs loves Uber, Meta and Amazon — and ranks them in order of preferenceBroadcom bolsters stock with new Apple deal. Here's why the experts like itHere are Cowen's top chip picks for an EV and autonomous-auto future Redwood City Ventures, a fund that invests in bitcoin and blockchain companies, has also opened an office in the American territory.For many, the big draw to the island has to do with Act 60, which offers significant tax savings to qualifying residents. In the U.S., investors pay as much as 37% on short-term capital gains and up to 20% on long-term gains, which applies to crypto and other assets held for more than a year. One of the tax breaks under Act 60, known as the Individual Investors Act, drops that tax obligation down to zero if certain qualifications are met. This is especially huge for entrepreneurs and crypto traders.There is also a major tax incentive for business owners to set down roots in Puerto Rico. Mainland companies are subject to a 21% federal corporate tax, plus a state tax, which varies. If a firm exports its services out of Puerto Rico, to the U.S. or really, anywhere else, they pay a 4% corporate tax rate.  CPA Shehan Chandrasekera does caution that any gains realized before arriving to Puerto Rico are still subject to the standard capital gains tax rates on the U.S. mainland. It is just the gains that are earned after becoming a Puerto Rican resident that are excluded from taxes.""That's the part that people are not talking about,"" said Chandrasekera, who heads tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io. But there is a workaround.If an investor has a certain amount of gain, they can go to Puerto Rico, establish residency, sell their stake, and then buy it back as a new position. That way, they avoid muddying the waters with any gains they carry over from the U.S. Puerto Rico's almost too-good-to-be-true tax rules were dreamed up a decade ago to help bring in people and cash at a time when the island was hemorrhaging residents and money. Over the last several years, the territory has suffered a string of bad luck — earthquakes, hurricanes, a multi-year bankruptcy and a global pandemic. Much to the government's relief, investors are now coming in at a record pace. Corporate and tax attorney Giovanni Mendez has been helping to onboard new Puerto Ricans. He tells CNBC that nearly half of his clients right now are either crypto companies or crypto investors, a number that's increased exponentially in the last six years.Mendez, who was raised in a town two hours west of the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan, says that in March 2020, right as the Covid pandemic began to shut down countries around the world, he began speaking with clients about whether to move to Florida (a tax-free state) or Puerto Rico. In the end, many opted for Puerto Rico.""I really wasn't expecting a lot of people to move with everything going on with the pandemic, but to the contrary, a lot of people actually just decided to pull the trigger,"" said Mendez. ""That's certainly coupled with an increase in the value of crypto assets."" Crypto investor George Burke had been thinking about making the move since 2018, but he finally went for it last year.""With the performance of how 2021 was going with bitcoin, and the performance of my company, I knew I needed to make a change, so Puerto Rico became a really good option,"" said Burke.Though Burke wouldn't share an exact dollar figure with CNBC, he did say that his crypto holdings rise to the mid-seven figure range. ""I was in the crowd sale of ethereum…There were only like 6,000 people who were able to do that,"" said Burke, who tells CNBC that he also worked on the first bitcoin debit card back in 2013.As for the move itself, Burke says the process was relatively straightforward.""I got on a plane, I established my residency the same day that I got off the plane just by renting a room at my friend's house, and I started the clock,"" he said. Burke added that he didn't have to apply before arriving. He put in an app for the individual investor's exemption himself, and he paid an attorney $15,000 to help with his business exemption.It was a similar experience for Johnston, who says it took between six and nine months to go through all the perfunctory reviews, though it ""didn't take a huge amount of effort.""""I mean, it's America,"" said Johnston. ""You don't need a visa. You don't have to apply for residency. You don't need a passport. You can just grab a domestic flight and show up in San Juan, grab a driver's license, buy a house, and open an office downtown.""""It was pretty smooth,"" he added.  Before making the move to Puerto Rico, Theodore Agranat tells CNBC that he knew little about Puerto Rico, aside from the fact that it was an American territory. He also recalled seeing images of former President Donald Trump throwing paper towels into a crowd when Hurricane Maria was happening.But after speaking with friends who had made the move and making a scouting trip himself last spring, the 45-year-old felt like Puerto Rico could be the kind of place he had been searching for since his first son was born in 2003: A community of entrepreneur families with kids, comprised of open-minded people who embraced home-schooling and alternative diets — Agranat himself is into raw foods — while at the same time functioning much like a start-up incubator, bringing together business-savvy and creative minds. He found just that in the southeast Puerto Rican city of Humacao.Agranat, who runs an early-stage blockchain investment fund that put money into over 225 projects last year, says the financial incentives were also a huge draw.  Thus far, island life is working out pretty well. Agranat and his wife home-school their three children, and for their 14-year-old, they've customized the curriculum to include crypto-related topics, including NFTs, crypto games, and token swapping.Johnston, who lives in the San Juan suburb of Guaynabo, has adopted a similar approach. He and his wife home-school all three of their children, and crypto has been a part of the lesson plan since day one.""My kids have had crypto wallets since they were born,"" Johnston told CNBC. ""When they did chores for grandma, grandma tried to pay them in cash once, and they said, 'No thanks, grandma. I prefer bitcoin.'""Outside of the suburbs, many gather for Crypto Mondays, a weekly meet-up held at nice hotels and restaurants in the capital, as well as Crypto Curious, which draws people new to the space and covers topics like NFTs, DeFi, and how to open your own crypto wallet. Hundreds of locals have begun to partake in those gatherings, which are now also being offered in Spanish. Burke, who says that his friends and crypto colleagues have been moving to Puerto Rico since the last bitcoin bull run in 2017, tells CNBC that every Thursday, he attends a luncheon with around 30 to 40 other crypto-minded folks who live in either Condado Beach or Old San Juan.  Not everyone is happy about the influx of new residents.For one, locals aren't thrilled about the fact that they don't qualify for the capital gains tax exemption, which is designed for non-Puerto Ricans. Mendez tells CNBC the local rate in Puerto Rico is 15% for long-term capital gains, and the disparity has strained relations between some locals and new residents. An organization that goes by #AbolishAct60 has pushed back on the tax breaks via social media.There is also a question as to whether the tax breaks are achieving what the government set out to do, including, among other things, creating jobs, and sinking more cash into the local economy. Economist and Nobel-prize winner Joseph Stiglitz told a crowd in San Juan in December that he was skeptical of the economic benefits of the tax scheme.The flood of the crypto rich into Puerto Rico has also helped to drive up real estate prices. ""The lack of inventory and the high demand has resulted in prices that we have never seen before in Puerto Rico,"" said Francisco Diaz Fournier of Luxury Collection Real Estate.""I've been tracking the markets for several years, and I was not expecting this…You have properties in Dorado Beach that have been sold for more than $20 million,"" said Fournier, who tells CNBC that there are other properties listed on the market right now for $27 million, $30 million, and $34 million, numbers which have increasingly become par for the course.Rising real estate prices and the growing cost of living have fanned the flames of resentment.But Keiko Yoshino, who was a government employee in Washington, D.C., for seven years before making the move to Puerto Rico, is trying to close this divide by running programs that pull the two groups together to facilitate a knowledge transfer. Which, in theory, is part of what the tax incentive program set out to do in the first place.Yoshino, who runs the Puerto Rico Blockchain Trade Association, plays a major role in planning and running Crypto Curious meet-ups. But a big part of what she's trying to do is dispel stereotypes.""I had been called a crypto colonizer,"" Yoshino said.

Walmart appears to be venturing into the metaverse with plans to create its own cryptocurrency and collection of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.The big-box retailer filed several new trademarks late last month that indicate its intent to make and sell virtual goods, including electronics, home decorations, toys, sporting goods and personal care products. In a separate filing, Walmart said it would offer users a virtual currency, as well as NFTs.According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Walmart filed the applications on Dec. 30. In total, seven separate applications have been submitted.In a statement, Walmart said it is ""continuously exploring how emerging technologies may shape future shopping experiences."" It declined to comment on the specific trademark filings.""We are testing new ideas all the time,"" the company added. ""Some ideas become products or services that make it to customers. And some we test, iterate and learn from."" ""[The filings are] super intense,"" said Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney. ""There's a lot of language in these, which shows that there's a lot of planning going on behind the scenes about how they're going to address cryptocurrency, how they're going to address the metaverse and the virtual world that appears to be coming or that's already here.""Gerben said that ever since Facebook announced it was changing its company name to Meta, signaling its ambitions beyond social media, businesses have been rushing to figure out how they will fit into a virtual world. Nike filed a slew of trademark applications in early November that previewed its plans to sell virtual branded sneakers and apparel. Later that month, it said it was teaming up with Roblox to create an online world called Nikeland. In December, it bought the virtual sneaker company RTFKT (pronounced ""artifact"") for an undisclosed amount.""All of a sudden, everyone is like, 'This is becoming super real and we need to make sure our IP is protected in the space,' "" said Gerben.Gap has also started selling NFTs of its iconic logo sweatshirts. The apparel maker said its NFTs will be priced in tiers ranging from roughly $8.30 to $415, and come with a physical hoodie.Elsewhere, both Under Armour's and Adidas' NFT debuts sold out last month. They're now fetching sky-high prices on the NFT marketplace OpenSea.Gerben said that apparel retailers Urban Outfitters, Ralph Lauren and Abercrombie & Fitch have also filed trademarks in recent weeks detailing their intent to open some sort of virtual store.A report from CB Insights outlined some of the reasons why retailers and brands might want to make such ventures, which can potentially offer new revenue streams.Launching NFTs makes it possible for businesses to ""tokenize"" physical products and services to help reduce online transaction costs, it said. And for luxury brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton, NFTs can serve as a form of authentication for tangible and more expensive goods, CB Insights noted.Gerben said that as more consumers familiarize themselves with the metaverse and items stored on the blockchain, more retailers will want to create their own ecosystem around it.According to Frank Chaparro, director at crypto-information services firm The Block, many retailers are still reeling from being late to e-commerce, so they don't want to miss out on the metaverse.""I think it's a win-win for any company in retail,"" Chaparro said. ""And even if it just turns out to be a fad, there's not a lot of reputation damage in just trying something weird out like giving some customers an NFT in a sweepstake, for instance.""—CNBC's Melissa Repko contributed to this report."

But payment giants have embraced the asset class as it becomes mainstream. Mastercard said Tuesday it inked a deal with Coinbase, the latest in a recent flurry of partnerships between payment and cryptocurrency giants.As part of the agreement, Coinbase customers will be able to use Mastercard credit and debit cards to make purchases on the crypto exchange's upcoming NFT marketplace. Coinbase unveiled late last year plans to launch the platform for minting and buying nonfungible tokens, which have exploded in popularity over the past 12 months.By teaming up with Mastercard, Coinbase executives said they're looking to reduce friction in the NFT buying process. Right now, that often requires customers opening up a crypto wallet, buying digital currencies, then spending those on NFTs in an online marketplace. Mastercard, meanwhile, said it's looking to help expand consumer choice on how to pay for NFTs.""Getting more people involved safely and securely is perhaps the best way to help the NFT market thrive. As it does, Mastercard sees even greater potential for NFTs' underlying tech to go beyond art and collectibles into many more areas,"" Mastercard's Raj Dhamodharan said.Mastercard, one of the world's largest credit card and payment companies, has been on a crypto partnership spree lately. Mastercard announced in October that it's teaming up with Bakkt to let banks and merchants in its network offer crypto-related services. It has also partnered up with Gemini, BitPay and Mintable, among others.Rival Visa has been equally active the crypto space. The company has more than 60 partnerships with companies in the space, including the one with Coinbase. American Express has also said it's exploring using its cards and network with stablecoins. But CEO Stephen Squeri recently told Yahoo Finance that consumers should not expect to see an Amex-crypto-linked card ""anytime soon.""Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were first designed to get around banks and intermediaries. But banks and payment companies have embraced those technologies as cryptocurrencies become mainstream.Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev said in an email that Tuesday's announcement as another example of Mastercard's ""out-of-the-box thinking"" in its approach to crypto. Over the long-term, though, Dolev said blockchain technologies and decentralized finance ""can be a threat to the overall network ecosystem as they are challenging the trusted third party concept.""Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world."
2022-01-18,"After a rough start to the year, the price of bitcoin is about flat in the last seven days. The largest cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $41,671, according to Coin Metrics.Ether, the second-largest, is up about 2% in the same time frame. It's now priced at $3,113.Other top coins had a better week. Cardano, Terra and Dogecoin, for example, jumped over the last seven days, Coin Gecko data shows.Along with price movement, here are six important things that happened in the crypto space last week. In June, Kim Kardashian posted an Instagram Story promoting a cryptocurrency called EthereumMax.""Are you guys into crypto???"" she wrote. ""This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends told me about the Ethereum Max token!"" Kardashian included the hashtag ""#ad,"" which indicates that the post was paid for as promotional content.A class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California was then filed on January 7, accusing Kardashian and other celebrities, like Floyd Mayweather, of ""making false or misleading statements"" about EthereumMax to allegedly increase its price.Ryan Huegerich, a New York resident, filed on behalf of himself and other investors who bought EthereumMax between May 14, 2021 and June 17, 2021. The lawsuit claims Huegerich and others lost money on their investments.Representatives for Kardashian and Mayweather were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. A spokesperson for EthereumMax told CNBC that the lawsuit was ""riddled with misinformation"" and disputed accusations that it was a scam. On Wednesday, Twitter and Block founder Jack Dorsey announced plans to create a ""Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund.""""The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is a non-profit entity that aims to minimize legal headaches that discourage software developers from actively developing Bitcoin and related projects,"" Dorsey wrote in an email.The fund will defend bitcoin developers from lawsuits, ""including finding and retaining defense counsel, developing litigation strategy and paying legal bills,"" with volunteer and part-time lawyers, he wrote. On Thursday, Dorsey confirmed that Block, formerly known as Square, will be ""officially building an open bitcoin mining system,"" he tweeted on Thursday. The company first announced that it was considering the project in October.Bitcoin operates on a proof of work (PoW) model, where miners must compete to solve complex puzzles in order to validate transactions. The process isn't easy: It requires a lot of energy and computer power, which isn't cheap. The computers themselves, along with other equipment, can also be very expensive.

2022-01-18,"U.K. Finance Minister Rishi Sunak plans to bring crypto ads under the same rules that apply to financial promotions.The government says it will introduce legislation to amend existing laws on financial advertising.Ads for crypto flooded London's underground rail network and buses last year amid rising interest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. LONDON — The U.K. government says it will bring cryptocurrency ads under tighter scrutiny and crack down on ""misleading"" claims that may cause investors to lose money.Finance Minister Rishi Sunak plans to bring the ads under the same rules for financial promotions, according to proposals announced Tuesday.The government will introduce legislation to amend existing laws on financial advertising to include crypto. The regime requires firms to be authorized by regulators if they want to promote investment products.The Financial Conduct Authority, a U.K. watchdog tasked with regulating financial firms, will soon start consulting on their proposed financial promotions rules for cryptocurrencies, the government said.""Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest — but it's important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims,"" Sunak said in a statement.The FCA has attracted criticism for not taking action against crypto ads, which flooded London's underground rail network and buses in the past year as interest in bitcoin and other digital currencies has risen. The FCA warns cryptocurrencies are not regulated, and that people investing in them should be prepared to lose all their money. While the regulatory body doesn't have any say over the crypto market specifically, it is getting tougher on companies operating in the sector. Last June, the watchdog hit Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, with a sharp warning saying the firm is not authorized to undertake any regulated activity. While Binance can still sell its services to U.K. residents through its website, it must show a notice explaining its British unit is not regulated.Tuesday's announcement means the FCA will eventually have the power to clamp down on crypto ads.British fintech firm Revolut, which offers trading in crypto and stocks, said it welcomes the news.""Clear guidance in how companies describe their crypto offering will benefit consumers and help improve trust in the sector,"" said Ed Cooper, Revolut's head of crypto. ""Revolut continues to follow the financial promotions rules in its crypto communications.""Britain's Advertising Standards Authority has already taken action against several crypto adverts. The regulator banned seven ads in December from companies including Coinbase and Papa John's for ""irresponsibly taking advantage of consumers' inexperience.""It also blocked a promotion from the crypto exchange Luno, which encouraged people to buy bitcoin without warning of the risks involved in trading cryptocurrencies. The ASA also said it is on ""red alert"" over the issue.While bitcoin had a stellar year in 2021, climbing almost 60%, it and other digital tokens are notoriously volatile. They've been known to rise or fall more than 10% in a single day.Bitcoin is currently down about 40% from an all-time high of nearly $69,000, which it hit in November."
2022-01-19,"For billionaire investor Mark Cuban, there was one defining moment that led him to go all in on cryptocurrency.""I always paid attention to bitcoin, the pricing, the tokens and the [crypto]currencies,"" Cuban told Miami Mayor Francis Suarez at The North American Bitcoin Conference on Monday. ""But what really got me into it was, about a year ago, when I minted my first NFT.""NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, are unique digital assets. Minting an NFT is the process of turning an asset into a token that's represented on the blockchain. It allows NFT owners to both prove that they own the asset and be able to sell it if they want.For Cuban, the opportunity to also earn royalties on secondary sales of his NFTs was huge.""The fact that you could take a digital file — audio, video, picture, whatever — and not only mint it to sell it, but also attach royalties to it, I'm like, 'How can you do that?' Because you can't do that with anything physical,"" the ""Shark Tank"" investor and Dallas Mavericks owner said.After digging a bit deeper, Cuban learned about smart contracts, which are collections of code that carry out a set of instructions on the blockchain. Smart contracts are crucial for NFTs, as well as other crypto projects, such as decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications. ""To me, that's very disruptive,"" he said.""NFTs, while they're hot right now and everybody is talking about them, they're really more just a proof of concept for what you can do with smart contracts and decentralization,"" Cuban told Suarez.Now, Cuban considers himself a crypto ""evangelist,"" he said.

2022-01-19,"Microsoft's planned $68.7 billion acquisition of gaming company Activision Blizzard isn't just a weapon in the tech giant's battle for video game domination.It's also about the metaverse — a buzzy topic at the moment, with brands from Disney to Walmart working to carve out their own niche in the digital space, which promises virtual worlds where people can eventually explore, work and play.Gaming appears to be a particularly large part of Microsoft's metaverse plans. In a press release on Tuesday, the company wrote that buying the ""Call of Duty"" and ""Warcraft"" maker ""will provide building blocks for the metaverse."" Later in that press release, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was quoted as saying that gaming ""will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms.""The move may have been a long time coming. Corporate metaverse interest seemingly exploded after Facebook, now called Meta, changed its name to reflect its bet on a virtually focused future. But Microsoft and Nadella were talking publicly about the idea's potential even before Mark Zuckerberg — and acquiring companies with large gaming communities to give them a leg up.In 2020, Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for ZeniMax Media, the parent company of gaming studio Bethesda. And back in 2014, the tech giant paid $2.5 billion for Mojang, the maker of ""Minecraft.""""As the virtual and physical worlds converge, the metaverse…is emerging as a first-class platform,"" Nadella said in April 2021 during a quarterly earnings call. Microsoft's gaming communities, like ""Minecraft"" and its then-140 million monthly users, could grow into huge commercial marketplaces ""as games evolve into metaverse economies,"" he added.That earnings call came about three months before Zuckerberg first revealed his plans for Facebook and the metaverse, teasing the company's eventual transformation into Meta in October. At Microsoft's Ignite 2021 conference in November, Nadella compared the promise of the metaverse to the way the tech world looked at the nascent internet in the 1990s.""When we talk about the metaverse, we're describing both a new platform and a new application type, similar to how we talked about the web and websites in the early '90s,"" Nadella said in a keynote address at the conference. ""It's no longer just playing a game with friends. You can be in the game with them.""Microsoft does not yet offer the sort of commercial virtual reality headset that would be needed for such an immersive gaming experience. But in June, Nadella described the economic impact that metaverse gaming can already provide: During a conversation with Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft-owned Xbox, Nadella noted that the creators of tens of thousands of ""Minecraft"" game modifications have collectively pulled in more than $350 million, by building new landscapes for other players to explore.""They're creating entire college campuses on 'Minecraft,'"" Nadella said. Microsoft also profits off communities of gamers making in-game purchases, he noted.A market report last year estimated that in-game purchases could top $34 billion in revenue in 2021. The Activision deal could help increase Microsoft's cut: It includes Candy Crush Saga, one of the world's most popular mobile games, which is estimated to pull in more than $1 billion per year from in-app purchases.Of course, Microsoft's metaverse bets aren't limited to gaming. The company launched a Mesh cloud collaboration service for virtual 3D business meetings last year, which Microsoft said ""can serve as a gateway to the metaverse.""And at Microsoft's Build conference in May 2021, Nadella's keynote address delved into what he describes as the ""enterprise metaverse,"" where companies can use Microsoft's business software products to monitor their supply chains in the metaverse, building ""a complete digital twin"" to their real-world infrastructure to better track products from the manufacturing stage to delivery.But Tuesday's agreement to buy Activision shows that Microsoft could view gaming as a way to compete with Meta and any other metaverse giants going forward. Indeed, Nadella has already hinted at the idea of multiple metaverses just under the umbrella of Microsoft's gaming divisions.""If you take 'Halo' as a game, it is a metaverse. 'Minecraft' is a metaverse, and so is 'Flight Sim,'"" Nadella told Bloomberg in November. ""In some sense, they're 2D today, and the question is: 'Can you now take that to a full 3D world?' And we absolutely plan to do so.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Bill Gates says the metaverse will host most of your office meetings within 'two or three years'This 29-year-old book predicted the 'metaverse' — and some of Facebook's plans are eerily similar"
2022-01-19,"The Federal Trade Commission won't back down in the face of intimidation from better-resourced opponents, said Chair Lina Khan in an exclusive interview with CNBC, her first on-camera sit-down.Khan personally has faced pushback from Amazon and Facebook in particular, which petitioned for her recusal from antitrust matters involving their businesses.She said her agency has a duty to consider which cases could have a deterrent effect on other potentially unlawful conduct. The Federal Trade Commission won't back down in the face of intimidation from better-resourced opponents, said Chair Lina Khan in an exclusive interview with CNBC Wednesday, her first on-camera sit-down.Khan said it takes ""courage"" to take on companies with immense power, especially in the face of the FTC's own resource challenges that force it to narrow the scope of its enforcement capabilities.""We're really showing these companies, but also showing the country, that enforcers are not going to back down because of these companies flexing some muscle or kind of trying to intimidate us,"" Khan told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin and Kara Swisher, host of The New York Times' ""Sway"" podcast. ""I think those are the types of lessons that we're trying to learn looking back over the last decade.""Under her leadership, the FTC has taken steps to show its resolve against big business. The agency filed an amended complaint against Facebook on antitrust charges after its earlier one was dismissed, and this time it was allowed to advance. And in the face of a historic merger surge, the FTC has also signaled it will impose tougher sanctions on firms that pursue anticompetitive mergers, like requiring prior approval for future transactions in settlements.Khan personally has faced pushback from Amazon and Facebook in particular, which petitioned for her recusal from antitrust matters involving their businesses. They argued that Khan's past statements and work for the Open Markets Institute and the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust investigating tech firms, indicated she had prejudged their liability.Khan also made a name for herself in academic circles through her 2017 Yale Law Journal article ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,"" which argued for a more expansive interpretation of antitrust laws when applied to digital markets.Just last week, a judge in the FTC's antitrust lawsuit against Facebook affirmed that Khan did not need to recuse herself from the vote to file the amended complaint in the suit, ruling that she was not acting in an adjudicatory role. Khan said it was ""terrific"" to see the judge respond in that way.Khan credited the forceful approach of some of these firms with the standards they had gotten used to from law enforcement historically. She said while they experienced ""lighter touch treatment in the past,"" they're now responding to a pileup of enforcement actions.Khan declined to throw her weight behind any particular bills that would reform antitrust law that are being considered in Congress, but she supported additional resources for the agency and generally welcomed congressional action to minimize certain hurdles enforcers must consider in bringing cases.As it stands, Khan said the agency does have to choose its workload wisely, which often involves trade-offs about what it can pursue. Given those constraints, the question of which enforcement actions could have a deterrent effect becomes an important one, she said.""We have to make very difficult choices about which billion-dollar deals we're going to ensure we're closely investigating, but there are very real trade-offs in terms of what that work is going to come at the expense of,"" she said.""What are instances in which certain types of actions could have a market-wide impact?"" Khan said, giving an example of a question the agency might consider. ""If we are able to obtain a particular settlement or consent decree or get a good outcome in court, what are instances in which that could really change the dynamic in the entire market rather than just, you know, here or there?""Khan said the agency also considers which cases could involve unlawful practices that also have an ""upstream source.""""So certain types of intermediaries or companies that may be facilitating bad practices, going upstream and really try to nip it at the source can also be one way we try to channel our resources in ways that can be more efficient,"" she said.The FTC's lawsuit against Facebook, first filed under Khan's predecessor, is one example of a case the agency has chosen to pursue that could have broader implications for the industry as a whole. In the suit, the FTC claimed that Facebook used its acquisitions of then-nascent competitors Instagram and WhatsApp to amass power and create barriers that impede other firms from entering the market. If the FTC prevails in that case, it could make tech and other industries more skittish about pursuing such acquisitions in the future.Khan said she recognizes the relatively short period of time she has to act on these issues, and aims to do so ""with a fierce sense of urgency.""""I think there's an opportunity here to really change and learn from the mistakes of the past and that's what we're going to try to do,"" she said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.WATCH: How US antitrust law works, and what it means for Big Tech"
2022-01-20,"Russia's central bank on Thursday proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies on Russian territory, citing threats to financial stability, citizens' wellbeing and its monetary policy sovereignty.Russia has argued for years against cryptocurrencies, saying they could be used in money laundering or to finance terrorism. It eventually gave them legal status in 2020 but banned their use as a means of payment.Russia is the world's third-largest player in bitcoin mining, behind the United States and Kazakhstan, though the latter may see a miner exodus over fears of tightening regulation following unrest earlier this month. Russia's central bank on Thursday proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies on Russian territory, citing threats to financial stability, citizens' wellbeing and its monetary policy sovereignty.The move is the latest in a global cryptocurrency crackdown as governments from Asia to the United States worry that privately operated and highly volatile digital currencies could undermine their control of financial and monetary systems.Russia has argued for years against cryptocurrencies, saying they could be used in money laundering or to finance terrorism. It eventually gave them legal status in 2020 but banned their use as a means of payment.In a report published on Thursday, the central bank said speculative demand primarily determined cryptocurrencies' rapid growth and that they carried characteristics of a financial pyramid, warning of potential bubbles in the market, threatening financial stability and citizens.The bank proposed preventing financial institutions from carrying out any operations with cryptocurrencies and said mechanisms should be developed to block transactions aimed at buying or selling cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies.The proposed ban includes crypto exchanges. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance told Reuters it was committed to working with regulators and hoped the report's release would spawn dialogue with the central bank on protecting the interests of Russian crypto users.Restrictions on owning cryptocurrency are not envisaged, said Elizaveta Danilova, head of the central bank's financial stability department.Active cryptocurrency users, Russians have an annual transaction volume of about $5 billion, the bank said.Shadowing China?The central bank said it would work with regulators in countries where crypto exchanges are registered to collect information about the operations of Russian clients. It pointed to steps taken in other countries, such as China, to curb cryptocurrency activity.In September, China intensified its crackdown on cryptocurrencies with a blanket ban on all crypto transactions and mining, hitting bitcoin and other major coins and pressuring crypto and blockchain-related stocks.""For now there are no plans to ban cryptocurrencies similar to the experience of China,"" Danilova said. ""The approach we have proposed will suffice.""Joseph Edwards, head of financial strategy at crypto firm Solrise Group, played down the report's significance, saying no one outside Russia would be losing sleep over it.""Moscow, like Beijing, is always rattling its sabre over 'crypto bans', but Russia has never been a pillar of any facet of the industry in the same way as China has been at times,"" he said.Crypto miningRussia is the world's third-largest player in bitcoin mining, behind the United States and Kazakhstan, though the latter may see a miner exodus over fears of tightening regulation following unrest earlier this month. read moreThe Bank of Russia said crypto mining created problems for energy consumption. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are ""mined"" by powerful computers that compete against others hooked up to a global network to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The process guzzles electricity and is often powered by fossil fuels.""The best solution is to introduce a ban on cryptocurrency mining in Russia,"" the bank said.In August, Russia accounted for 11.2% of the global ""hashrate"" - crypto jargon for the amount of computing power being used by computers connected to the bitcoin network.Moscow-based BitRiver, which operates data centers in Siberia hosting bitcoin miners, said it did not consider a complete crypto ban likely, expecting a balanced position to develop once different ministries have discussed the proposals.The central bank, which is planning to issue its own digital rouble, said crypto assets becoming widespread would limit the sovereignty of monetary policy, with higher interest rates needed to contain inflation."
2022-01-20,"Hedge fund manager David Neuhauser, who has made a name for himself by betting against some of the market's most popular stocks, shared with CNBC his tips for young investors.Speaking on the latest CNBC Pro Talks, Neuhauser suggested that investors should be wary of big-name technology stocks that have seen ""explosive growth"" over the past couple of years amid the coronavirus pandemic.Even so, Neuhauser said it would still be worthwhile for young people to put their money into certain technology stocks because it's invested in the market for a long timescale. This means any major highs and lows would be more likely to even out over time, in theory.The Livermore Partners founder and chief investment officer said he preferred smaller technology companies ""because the potential for those companies to grow is actually there.""Neuhauser said it was ""much more difficult"" to find long-term growth opportunities among the ""mammoth"" companies that are already valued in the trillions of dollars, or even upward of $800 billion. In addition to factoring in company valuations, Neuhauser said it was important for young investors to focus on the effect that rising interest rates could have on stocks.Neuhauser said that he didn't think younger investors were paying enough attention to this as both a headwind for markets and as a potential buying opportunity.Watch the full Pro Talks with David Neuhauser hereHe said that the youngest cohort of investors have ""never seen a bear market, they've never seen a recession, they've never seen a contraction, even in earnings, where a company is still growing, but their earnings have contracted for a while, and those are usually typically the times to be buying those stocks.""In the more-than 25 years that he's been investing, Neuhauser said that he'd often made money after identifying a stock that was out of favor as the economic cycle was ""just about to turn."" Neuhauser shorted (betted against) some major market names last year, including Meta (formerly Facebook) and Tesla. Livermore Partners had also previously shorted the ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund, which is run by investment guru Cathie Wood.Check out: Neuhauser says Ark ETF stocks are a potential 'time bomb'During the latest CNBC Pro Talks, Neuhauser maintained the view that the valuations of some bigger technology companies were more likely to come under pressure going forward.He explained that amid the pandemic these companies had benefitted from increased demand for technology, like software-as-a-service, along with the Federal Reserve's emergency economic support measures.However, Neuhauser expects this demand to slow down. In addition, he said the Fed's plans to raise interest rates this year, and pull back other supportive measures, would make capital expenditure — the cost of maintaining certain internal investments — more expensive for these companies.Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker told CNBC last week he could see as many as four interest rate hikes this year. Many investors believe that the central bank could enact the first rate hike in March. The mounting anticipation of rate hikes, and overall tighter monetary policy, has seen a choppy start to the year for markets, with sell-offs led by technology stocks.

Singapore may be able to draw companies to its stock market through its push for SPACs, said Ringo Choi, EY Asia-Pacific IPO leader.""Companies may be considering to be listed in Hong Kong or say Malaysia or other ASEAN countries, but they will prefer to go for this Singapore SPAC IPO if they have this opportunity,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Thursday.He pointed out that the blank check company was heavily oversubscribed, and the firms may be able to price shares higher in Singapore.That could be a boost for the city state, which has seen average IPO sizes decline and thin liquidity in recent years, Choi said. The authorities want Singapore to be a competitive financial hub with high trading volumes, and were eager to introduce new pathways, he said.Singapore is one of the first markets in Asia to allow such listings. Michael Marquardt, CEO of investor services company IQ-EQ Asia, described Singapore's approach to SPACs as conservative because it only relaxed its regulations last year.""This strategy has provided investors with the confidence they need to trigger new SPAC listings,"" he said in an email. The commitment to create a safe and regulated capital market environment will benefit SPACs in the long run by attracting more inflows, he said.Marquardt also predicted that more SPACs will start to list in Asia's financial hubs.""Given the changes to Hong Kong's listing regime that came into effect at the start of the year, these rule revisions across both jurisdictions will serve to encourage SPAC activity in Asia,"" he said."
2022-01-21,"The cryptocurrency market, along with other riskier assets, is taking a big hit.Bitcoin is down 11% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Hitting its lowest level since August, the largest cryptocurrency by market value dropped below $40,000 on Friday, and is currently trading at around $38,378. Some analysts predict that it could fall even lower.Along with it, ether, the second-largest, is down 14% in the same timeframe. It's currently trading around $2,779.This comes as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffer losses as well. Cryptocurrencies and tech stocks have been falling at the same time this month, showing an increasing correlation between the two.Additionally, there's concern over the potential for more cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S., as well as how the Federal Reserve potentially dialing back its monetary policy would impact the overall market. Globally, other regulators are focusing on cryptocurrency markets as well. On Thursday, for example, Russia's central bank proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies.This dip isn't unusual for bitcoin; cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. As quickly as prices rise, they can tumble back down. Because of this, experts say it's important to consider if you can handle the ups and downs before investing in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.""It's a very volatile asset class,"" Anjali Jariwala, certified financial planner, certified public accountant and founder of Fit Advisors, previously told CNBC Make It. ""You have to be comfortable with the swings and you have to be comfortable also losing your money.""Each investor's risk tolerance will vary. It's important to understand how much you can personally tolerate.For some people, the volatility ""may be OK, that may coincide with your appetite for risk and your own risk tolerance and investment time horizon,"" Douglas Boneparth, certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth, previously told CNBC Make It. ""But, you still got to live with it."" Other investors may prefer something more stable.Regardless of your tolerance level, financial experts warn that this volatility makes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a riskier investment than something like a low-cost index fund, which allows investors to buy a collection of stocks at once, rather than bet on a single asset.If you decide to invest anyway, ""you have to make sure that it's money that you can really afford to lose,"" Jariwala said.Boneparth agrees: ""Be very careful about how much you allocate and understanding what you can tolerate, because if 80% of your net worth is tied to bitcoin, and it goes down 30%, that's rough.""Depending on what you can afford, a smaller allocation in bitcoin can hedge any potential downturns in the market.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: This 29-year-old launched a business to support Black NFT artists—and it made $140,000 in 10 months"
2022-01-21,"Shares of MicroStrategy tumbled 17.8% Friday afternoon after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly rejected the company's bitcoin accounting strategy.The business-intelligence software company's stock had been falling in tandem with the price of bitcoin, which dropped more than 10% Friday to its lowest point since August. MicroStrategy shares are down 24.7% for the week.A filing released Thursday showed the SEC rejecting the accounting method MicroStrategy was using for bitcoin in its earnings reporting.""We note your response to prior comment 5 and we object to your adjustment for bitcoin impairment charges in your non-GAAP measures,"" the filing said. ""Please revise to remove this adjustment in future filings."" MicroStrategy began buying bitcoin as part of a capital allocation strategy in 2020, setting it apart from other companies. It has been aggressively buying bitcoin ever since, making its shares a proxy for the cryptocurrency.As of the end of 2021, MicroStrategy held 124,391 bitcoins, acquired for roughly $3.75 billion at an average price of about $30,159 per bitcoin, CEO Michael Saylor announced on Twitter at the time."
2022-01-21,"Bitcoin prices fell sharply on Friday, while ether prices also dived, wiping off nearly $150 billion from the crypto market.Bitcoin fell about 15% and was trading around $36,000 late Friday, according to Coin Metrics. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, dived about 20% to trade around $2,500.The declines in cryptocurrencies follow Wall Street losses on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite lost 7.6% this week, and the S&P 500 fell 5.7% for its third straight weekly decline.Rising rates have prompted investors to shed positions in riskier assets. Earlier this week, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield traded above 1.9%.The Federal Reserve have also indicated it plans to begin reducing its balance sheet, as well as tapering of bonds and raising interest rates. A common investment case for bitcoin is that it serves as a hedge against rising inflation as a result of government stimulus, but analysts are saying the risk is that a more hawkish Federal Reserve may take the wind out of bitcoin's sails.Bitcoin prices have fallen sharply since November, tumbling more than 40% from a record high of about $69,000.Some experts warn that the crypto market could be heading toward a downturn soon, as heightened regulatory scrutiny and intense price fluctuations dampened bitcoin's prospects.

Former Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein said his view of cryptocurrencies has evolved after digital assets attracted trillions of dollars in value and a rapidly growing ecosystem.On Monday, Blankfein was asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on ""Squawk Box"" for his view on the nascent asset class, who noted that the former banker has voiced skepticism in the past.""Look, my view of it is evolving,"" Blankfein said.

Traditional financial companies including Goldman have begun offering clients ways to buy, trade and custody digital currencies, and a parallel universe of decentralized finance protocols has emerged so holders can lend out and earn yield on their coins.Cryptocurrencies have been selling off for weeks as expectations of rising interest rates hit riskier assets.

""Of course, we have the benefits of instantaneous transfer and reduction of credit risk and all the benefits of blockchain.""In the past, Blankfein has criticized bitcoin as a store of value and said that regulators should be ""hyperventilating"" over its rise.""I may be skeptical, but I'm also pragmatic about it,"" Blankfein said Monday. ""And so guess what? I would certainly want to have an oar in that water.""In the wide-ranging interview, Blankfein discussed how uncertainty over inflation has caused bearishness throughout markets in recent weeks. He also said that banks trade at an ""unbelievably low multiple"" and that some of the best investments are made in declining markets."
2022-01-24,"Bitcoin climbed into positive territory after falling below $33,000 to a new low.The No. 1 cryptocurrency and ether are sitting about 45% and 49% from their respective all-time highs.The steep declines have been correlated to the selling seen in higher risk assets like technology stocks as investors prepare for higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin bounced into positive territory Monday after initially continuing its slide from last week.On Monday, bitcoin fell to $32,982.11, its lowest point since July, according to Coin Metrics, but the largest cryptocurrency by market cap was up 5.6% in afternoon trading, to $37,183.25, as broader equities reversed course and ended the day higher. Earlier in the session, the Dow fell as much as 1,115 points and the S&P 500 briefly fell into correction territory.Ether plunged to as low as $2,176.41, its lowest since July, according to Coin Metrics. It last rose 1.1% to $2,444.85. Bitcoin and ether are about 45% and 49% off their respective all-time highs.Cryptocurrencies have been moving in tandem with stocks, which have continued to fall since the beginning of the year and just came off of their worst week since March 2020. Investors have been selling risk assets like technology stocks, as they prepare for tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.""It's possible that macroeconomic concerns, such as the Fed's response to inflation rates, have facilitated more de-risking activity in general,"" said Juthica Chou, head of OTC options trading at Kraken. ""The recent price drop, coupled with high volatility, could be leading to further selling as participants look to reduce risk."" Loading chart... Investors also are assessing the impact of further regulation on the cryptocurrency market. Last week, Russia's central bank proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies.Given current market sentiment, bitcoin is likely to test the $30,000-$32,000 range, according to Vijay Ayyar, Luno's vice president of corporate development and international expansion. If the cryptocurrency holds above $30,000 for as long as one week, there could be a base formed at those levels before the market moves higher, he said. However, it could be some time for the market to turn bullish given the lack of confidence across the spectrum, he added.Several other analysts have said they see $30,000 as the next level of support for the cryptocurrency to test. However, analyst John Roque of 22V Research said bitcoin could fall even further. He also has been using $30,000 as a target but noted the median historical bear market for bitcoin is down 78%.  ""A 78% decline from the bitcoin high of nearly $69,000 would imply a potential downside figure of about $15,000,"" he said in a note Monday. ""It's probably safe to say that not one bitcoin bull has that figure in their model. To be sure, we don't either… but we think it's worth keeping in our back pocket in case we need it.""Investors are also grappling with rising inflation. Bitcoin proponents have long suggested the digital coin is a hedge against inflation, but that theory has not held up for many newer investors. As institutional interest poured into bitcoin last year, there are more short-term investors in the crypto market valuing bitcoin like a tech stock than ever before. Analysts have said there's concern a more hawkish Fed could take the wind out of the crypto market's sails.""Looking forward, our most immediate concern is how equities markets respond to this week's Fed meeting, especially after having just endured their worst week since the global onset of Covid,"" said Leah Wald, CEO at digital asset investment manager Valkyrie Funds.""A consolidation in stocks would lead to a risk-on environment where traders are more willing to take on additional risk assets such as bitcoin,"" she added, ""since digital assets have become increasingly correlated to equities as more companies continue to add bitcoin to their balance sheets.

2022-01-24,"Charts suggest that the selling in the world's two largest cryptocurrencies may run its course soon, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday.""To me, that says it might be too late to sell and you need to consider buying. I know I am, especially if we get a final leg down,"" Cramer said.The ""Mad Money"" host rooted his comments in analysis from veteran technician Tom DeMark. Charts suggest the selling in the world's two largest cryptocurrencies may run its course soon, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday, leaning on analysis from veteran technician Tom DeMark.""When the charts, as interpreted by Tom DeMark, say that both bitcoin and ethereum could be looking at downside trend exhaustion bottoms this week, if not today, I think you need to take him seriously,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.""To me, that says it might be too late to sell and you need to consider buying. I know I am, especially if we get a final leg down,"" added Cramer, who personally owns some ether, which runs on the ethereum blockchain. He previously owned bitcoin, as well.Bitcoin earlier Monday reached its lowest point since July when it fell to $32,982.11 per token, according to Coin Metrics. However, bitcoin reversed course during the trading day, ultimately moving higher to around $36,000. The cryptocurrency remains well off its all-time high of nearly $69,000 reached in the fall.Ether also touched its lowest level since July on Monday, falling as low as $2,176.41 before paring some of those losses, according to Coin Metrics. It's down about 50% from its all-time high. While there's a risk that bitcoin's steep decline in recent weeks could cause structural damage to the cryptocurrency, Cramer said DeMark is betting that will not happen — just like bitcoin's roughly 56% drawdown from April to June 2021 didn't prevent it from setting new highs in the fall. In fact, DeMark notes that bitcoin's current angle of descent is identical to its 2021 plunge, Cramer said. ""In other words, there's a good chance that history continues to repeat itself.""Looking specifically at bitcoin's recent trading, Cramer said the cryptocurrency is at No. 11 of DeMark's well-known 13-session countdown pattern, which the technician uses to identify when a rally or decline will be exhausted. ""We need two more negative closes before his buy trigger fires,"" said Cramer, who added that DeMark also would like to see bitcoin test his downside price targets.If Monday's intraday turnaround ends up leading to only a brief rally, ""DeMark wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin getting hit with a two- or three-day panic selling climax, which could briefly take it all the way down to 26,355,"" Cramer said. Ether ""has already hit 13 on his buy countdown for the first time since the peak. That tells DeMark that we could be looking at a trend exhaustion bottom,"" Cramer said, noting that ""fortunately"" ether also fell beneath DeMark's downside price projection of $2,434.Despite these positive technical indications, DeMark cautions that ether may still fall further. ""If we get another panicked breakdown, he could see [ether] temporarily dipping to $1,859 in a selling climax, but that would be your moment to buy, not sell, into the teeth of the panic,"" Cramer said.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.

2022-01-25,"The IMF is urging El Salvador to discontinue bitcoin's status as legal tender.In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt the world's biggest cryptocurrency as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar. The International Monetary Fund is pushing El Salvador to ditch bitcoin as legal tender, according to a statement released on Tuesday.IMF directors ""stressed that there are large risks associated with the use of bitcoin on financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection, as well as the associated fiscal contingent liabilities.""The report, which was published after bilateral talks with El Salvador, went on to ""urge"" authorities to narrow the scope of its bitcoin law by removing bitcoin's status as legal money. In September 2021, the Central American nation became the world's first country to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar.Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele — who has tethered his political fate to the success of the country's bitcoin experiment — has added hundreds of bitcoin to the country's balance sheet in recent months. On Friday, the president tweeted that he bought an additional $15 million of ""really cheap"" bitcoin, as the crypto market plummeted. Bitcoin is down about 50% from its November record high. The IMF report went on to say that some directors had expressed concern over the risks associated with issuing bitcoin-backed bonds, referring to the president's plan to raise $1 billion via a ""Bitcoin Bond"" in partnership with Blockstream, a digital assets infrastructure company.Part of El Salvador's nationwide move into bitcoin also involved launching a national virtual wallet called Chivo that offers no-fee transactions and allows for quick cross-border payments. For a country where 70% of citizens do not have access to traditional financial services, Chivo is meant to offer a convenient onramp for those who have never been a part of the banking system. IMF directors agreed that the Chivo e-wallet could facilitate digital means of payment, thereby helping to ""boost financial inclusion,"" though they emphasized the need for ""strict regulation and oversight."" Many Salvadorans have reported cases of identity theft, in which hackers use their national ID number to open a Chivo e-wallet, in order to claim the free $30 worth of bitcoin offered by the government as an incentive to open a digital wallet.For months, the IMF has bemoaned Bukele's bitcoin experiment.Tuesday's statement echoes a report shared by the IMF in November, in which the financial regulator wrote that bitcoin's high price volatility translated to significant risks to consumer protection and noted that bitcoin should not be used as legal tender.El Salvador has also been trying since early 2021 to secure a $1.3 billion loan from the IMF — an effort that appears to have soured over this bitcoin row.The country will need to figure out some other backstop to shore up its finances. The IMF predicts that under current policies, public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2026, putting the country on ""an unsustainable path."""

2022-01-25,"There’s a question about “virtual currency” on the front page of your tax return, making it clear you need to disclose crypto activity. If you don’t report transactions and face an IRS audit, you may be hit with interest, penalties or even criminal charges.“You’re playing with fire if you don’t report it,” said David Canedo, a CPA and tax specialist product manager at Accointing. After recent market dips, reporting last year's cryptocurrency profits on your tax return may be less appealing. But hiding taxable activity may lead to IRS trouble, experts warn.In 2021, the digital asset market sailed past $2 trillion, with bitcoin peaking at nearly $69,000 in November and ether growing to almost $5,000 during the same period. While values dropped in December, many investors still had sizable gains.  And the IRS has made it clear they are watching with a yes or no question about ""virtual currency"" near the top of the first page of your tax return.     ""That's where the hammer comes down because they can say that you lied on a government document under penalties of perjury,"" said Ryan Losi, a Richmond, Virginia-based CPA and executive vice president of accounting firm PIASCIK. More from Advice and the Advisor:Tax filing season kicks off.

Cryptocurrency may be subject to capital gains when exchanged or sold at a profit. Swapping digital coins, cashing out for U.S. dollars or even making a purchase may be taxable events, Losi explained.The gain or loss is the difference between your purchase price, known as basis, and the value when selling or exchanging, and your tax rates depend on the length of ownership.  If you held digital assets for more than one year, you might qualify for long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your taxable income.However, many crypto investors sell or exchange more frequently, according to a CNBC survey, triggering short-term capital gains, levied at regular income tax rates, up to 37% for top earners.What's worse, figuring out your basis to calculate your crypto tax bill may not be easy with limited reporting from digital currency exchanges.   If you don't report taxable crypto activity and face an IRS audit, you may incur interest, penalties, or even criminal charges.It may be considered tax evasion or fraud, said David Canedo, a Milwaukee-based CPA and tax specialist product manager at Accointing, a crypto tracking and tax reporting tool.While the chances of IRS scrutiny are lower with limited staffing, the agency may pursue larger amounts of money, he said.  For example, there's a big difference between buying bitcoin in 2012 and cashing out millions of dollars in 2021 versus small trades for $100 profit, Canedo said. But you still have to disclose everything regardless. ""You're playing with fire if you don't report it,"" he said.Although the IRS has a three-year lookback for errors, there is no statute of limitations for fraud, Canedo said.Another risk is whistleblowers, who can report missing activity to the IRS for a percentage of penalties collected, Losi from PIASCIK said.""The number one way the IRS finds out about tax cheats is a former business partner or former spouse,"" he said."

Brett Harrison, president of FTX U.S., said the market turbulence shows how crypto is a ""volatile asset class.""""Volatility cuts both ways,"" he said. ""With all of the large upturns that we've seen in crypto, we have to expect that there are going to be downturns as well. And we're definitely in that period right now.""Harrison said the phenomenon is ""not specific to crypto"" — stock markets have taken a tumble as well. ""I think that we are going to eventually see a bounce back,"" he added.FTX was set up in Hong Kong in 2019 by 29-year-old crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried. The wider company, recently valued by investors at $25 billion, has since moved its headquarters to the Bahamas.Bankman-Fried established FTX U.S. as the American sister to distinguish it from his main exchange, as officials in Washington began taking a closer look at the digital currency market. Trading launched on the platform in May 2020. In a trading update Wednesday, FTX U.S. said average daily volumes on its platform grew sevenfold in 2021, peaking at more than $800 million in November after bitcoin notched a record high of almost $69,000.The company facilitated more than $67 billion in spot crypto trades last year. It now has around 1.2 million registered users in total.FTX U.S. hopes the investment will help it gain an edge over rivals like Coinbase and Robinhood. Like FTX, the company is making a push into derivatives — contracts that allow investors to speculate on the performance of an asset. It acquired LedgerX, a crypto futures and options exchange, in October.Harrison says the U.S. market for crypto derivatives pales in comparison to the international marketplace. Investors see that there's ""an enormous opportunity for us to bring much of that volume onshore,"" he added.Coinbase is looking to make similar moves beyond spot trading, agreeing a deal to buy derivatives exchange FairX earlier this month. Still, regulators are growing concerned by the rapid rise of the crypto industry. They fear certain aspects of the market may pose the threat of contagion across financial markets, and that consumers are getting into crypto investments without knowing the risks involved.President Joe Biden's administration is reportedly expected to deliver an executive order calling for regulation of digital assets as early as next month.Harrison said officials in Washington have two primary concerns with crypto — stablecoins and oversight of exchanges.Digital currencies like tether and Circle's USD Coin are meant to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, but it's not that simple. Tether has admitted its reserves include short-term debt obligations and other assets as well as dollars. And, up until recently, USD Coin's reserves had included assets other than cash and U.S. government bonds.Meanwhile, crypto exchanges are currently regulated in the U.S. as money transfer businesses. Harrison says that's ""not a sustainable long-term future"" and wants stricter oversight with rules against market manipulation, a major source of concern in the crypto market."

Sources speaking to Bloomberg also say that the company is trying to find a new destination for the engineers who developed this technology.  Mark Zuckerberg's ambitious plan to build his own cryptocurrency is falling apart, amid growing pressure from regulators.The Diem Association, which oversees development of the Diem digital currency, is considering a sale of its assets, in order to return capital to its investors, according to a Bloomberg report released Wednesday morning.A spokesperson for the Diem Association declined to comment. Facebook's parent company, Meta, did not respond to a request for comment.Diem is reportedly in talks now with investment bankers about next steps, including how to sell its intellectual property, in an effort to capture whatever value is left. Sources speaking to Bloomberg say that the company is also trying to find a new destination for the engineers who developed this technology.Discussions are apparently still in early stages, and there is no guarantee that Diem will find a buyer. Even if it does, the report noted that it is unclear how it would set a value on the project's intellectual property, or the engineers who developed it.One of the people speaking to Bloomberg under condition of anonymity says that Meta owns about a third of the venture, and the remainder is owned by association members, such as Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital. Zuckerberg's beleaguered crypto project has been stymied by drama since it was first announced in June 2019.At the time, the cryptocurrency was called Libra, and it was initially conceived of as a stablecoin, which is a specific subset of cryptocurrencies that have a value pegged to a real-world asset, such as a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or a commodity like gold. In the case of Zuckerberg's stablecoin, the initial plan was to launch a universal currency tied to a basket of major currencies and government debt.The project was instantly met with hostility from central bankers and politicians, who feared it might facilitate nefarious activities such as money laundering and privacy infringement, as well as prove a formidable rival to sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar. In the wake of regulatory backlash, the embattled project pivoted to the concept of launching multiple stablecoins, each of which would be pegged to a fiat currency, plus one multicurrency coin.Ultimately, the vision for the cryptocurrency was slimmed down to a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin known as Diem USD.The project itself has also followed a somewhat convoluted chain of ownership and suffered an exodus of corporate partners and top-level executives.It also once had the backing of multiple partners, but as the Meta chief headed to Capitol Hill to defend the project, key backers like Visa, Mastercard and PayPal abandoned the project. In November of last year, David Marcus, the head of Meta's cryptocurrency efforts, announced that he, too, would be leaving."
2022-01-26,"Paris Hilton believes everything is going digital.That's why the 40-year-old hotel heiress is betting big on cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and now the metaverse.""I just really believe in them,"" Hilton, a longtime socialite and media personality whose enthusiasm comes from six years and counting of crypto investing, tells CNBC Make It.Hilton didn't disclose how much she has invested in crypto, but says she started investing in both bitcoin and ether in 2016. At the time, one bitcoin was valued at around $1,000 and one ether was priced around $10, according to Coin Metrics data. Today, they're worth more than $38,000 and $2,640, respectively.Hilton told The Guardian in November that she first started investing in crypto after becoming ""friends"" with the founders of ethereum, the decentralized computing platform that produces ether, the currency in which a majority of NFTs are traded. Now, even amid a recent cryptocurrency market selloff, during which both bitcoin and ether lost about 50% of their market value from their all-time highs in November, Hilton is still bullish.""I see digital currencies definitely rising [again],"" Hilton says. ""Right now, what I did, which is what people say, is buy the dip.""""Buy the dip"" refers to the concept of buying an asset after it has dropped in price, and hoping it'll rise again in the future. Investing experts warn that you should only invest money into crypto that you are willing to lose: Jumping in because the price has dropped shouldn't be your sole reason, Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington, D.C., told CNBC on Monday.Better reasons, Johnson said, include using crypto assets as stores of value and taking advantage of increasing crypto adoption rates across the world.As for NFTs, Hilton created her first one in 2019, and sold it in March 2020 for charity, winning ""Best Charity NFT"" at that year's NFT awards ceremony. In April 2021, she launched her own NFT collection, selling one called the ""Iconic Crypto Queen"" for $1.1 million in ether. She buys them, too: Hilton told The Guardian that she owned more than 150 NFTs.Most recently, the socialite joined NFT platform Origin Protocol as an investor and strategic advisor to help people mint their own NFTS and sell them on the site's platform.Hilton says creating art — like NFTs — has been therapeutic and healing for her. ""I see NFTs as the future of art,"" she says, noting that in the traditional art world, artists rarely get secondary sales like they often do with NFTs. ""I love that it gives power back to the creators.""She says her next NFT collection will focus on her life's story, including all its well-known highs and lows. In recent years, Hilton has been outspoken about the alleged abuse she endured at a Utah boarding school as a teen, and how it took a toll on her life ever since.""But now, I've really taken back my power and become a businesswoman and a social advocate,"" she says. ""I'm using my platform for good and positive change.""NFTs also go hand-in-hand with the metaverse, a network of 3D virtual worlds where people can work, play and explore — and a place where many are looking forward to showcasing their NFT collections. Hilton says she has been interested in the concept for years, well before Facebook rebranded as Meta and set the business world alight with metaverse buzz.In 2017, ""I was already developing, like, this whole 'Paris World' where people could watch me DJ and come hang out,"" she says.Paris World eventually became an outpost on gaming company Roblox's platform, which launched in October. This past New Year's Eve, Hilton used Paris World to host her first metaverse party. The virtual gathering was double the size of the crowd in New York City's Times Square that night, she says. (Roblox did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for confirmation.)""I thought that was amazing, and that was just the beta opening of it,"" Hilton says. ""The possibilities are truly endless.""Next up, she says: bringing NFTs into Paris World, building a new line of digital wearables and creating a digital fashion brand.Don't miss:Bitcoin vs. gold: Here's what billionaire Ray Dalio thinksNBA legend Shaquille O’Neal explains why he hasn’t invested in cryptoNBA legend Charles Barkley: My advisors 'don't believe in crypto'"

Google's cloud division has formed a group to build business around blockchain applications, following efforts to grow in retail, health care and other industries.Success could help Google further diversify away from advertising and become more prominent in the growing market for computing and storage services delivered from remote third-party data centers.Blockchain advocates often talk about constructing decentralized applications that leave large intermediaries out of the equation. In particular, DeFi (short for ""decentralized finance"") is a rapidly growing sector of the crypto market that aims to cut out middlemen, such as banks, from traditional financial transactions, like securing a loan.With DeFi, banks and lawyers are replaced by a programmable piece of code called a smart contract. This contract is written on a public blockchain, like ethereum or solana, and it executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary. This idea of decentralized apps has become more popular among technologists who envision Web3, a decentralized version of the internet that breaks away from Web 2.0, which saw an explosion of user-generated content such as blogs and social networks. Some of those services eventually came to be owned by large internet players — including Google, which bought Blogger and YouTube (which is now one of its strongest businesses).Today Amazon, Google and other cloud-computing providers represent a type of centralization, by operating vast facilities that offer computing services to millions of customers.

As customers in those sectors choose to adopt blockchain technologies, Google can help, Widmann said. Other cloud providers have become crypto-curious, too, although none other than Google has announced the establishment of a blockchain business group.Amazon Web Services, which led the cloud infrastructure market in 2020 with 40.8% share, according to technology industry researcher Gartner, announced a managed blockchain service in 2018. The website for the AWS service identifies Accenture, AT&T and Nestle as customers.Microsoft, which Gartner said had 19.7% share in 2020, introduced a fully managed Azure Blockchain Service in 2019 but retired it in September, citing ""lowered interest"" in a blog post. Smaller cloud providers are also aware of the opportunity.""We have a lot of blockchain and crypto customers on the platform,"" said Gabe Monroy, chief product officer at DigitalOcean, which focuses on small and midsize businesses. ""It was one of our biggest cohort growth segments over 2021. We're definitely paying close attention to the space.""Cryptocurrency companies are also starting to cater to software developers. Cryptocurrency exchange operator Coinbase has announced a slew of services under the banner Coinbase Cloud, and it describes the tools as being capable of running on multiple clouds.""This is kind of like our AWS for crypto,"" Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at the JPMorgan Crypto Economy Forum in November. ""We're trying to externalize some of the services that we've had to build. A lot of hard engineering has gone into how do we store crypto and integrate all the blockchains and monitor transactions for AML purposes and do trading and staking and all that.""Meanwhile, the founders of San Francisco start-up Alchemy told CNBC that they hope to be compared with AWS in the blockchain realm. Alchemy announced in October that it had raised venture capital at a $3.5 billion valuation.Google has been making itself more comfortable in the blockchain universe lately.Company veteran Shivakumar Venkataraman has taken charge of a new blockchain group, Bloomberg reported last week.

2022-01-27,"The idea of higher interest rates have spooked stock investors.The S&P 500 stock index is down more than 9% in January as of 2 p.m. ET Thursday.A slower U.S. economy (and lower corporate earnings) as well as the prospect of less risky assets like bonds becoming more attractive may result from higher interest rates, according to financial experts. The specter of rising interest rates is spooking the stock market.The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, is expected to increase its benchmark rate several times this year to tame stubbornly high inflation. Fed chair Jerome Powell affirmed that likelihood on Wednesday.related investing newsBank of America hikes year-end target for S&P 500, citing focus by companies on efficiency and A.I.Jesse Pounda day agoThe move would increase borrowing costs from near zero — where they've been since the beginning of the Covid pandemic — for businesses and consumers.  The forecast has caused stocks to nosedive in January.The S&P 500 index is down about 9% for the year. At one point this week, the basket of U.S. stocks dipped below 10% — the first time that's happened since the initial pandemic turmoil of March 2020. The index closed down 0.2% Wednesday after Powell's remarks, erasing earlier gains. Why does the stock market care?Broadly, the reasons seem to be twofold: A slowdown of the U.S. economy and the prospect of other investments like bonds becoming more attractive relative to stocks.When the Fed raises its benchmark interest rate, banks and lenders tend to raise borrowing costs, too. Mortgages, credit cards and other debt become pricier, reducing consumer spending and demand. Businesses also pay more to finance their operations.More from Personal Finance:What the Fed's plan to raise interest rates means for youWhy new parents may qualify for another $1,400 stimulus check3 reasons to keep your will or estate plan updatedBroadly, this dampens the outlook for company profits and reduces investor enthusiasm for buying their stock.  ""A tightening of monetary policy will put pressure on economic activity,"" according to Blair duQuesnay, a certified financial planner and investment advisor at Ritholtz Wealth Management, who is based in New Orleans. ""And it's by design."" The Fed's ""design"" is to cool off inflation. Consumer prices jumped 7% in December from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 1982.But the stock market isn't reacting just to a likely rate bump; stock gyrations have as much to do with uncertainty over how fast the Fed will accelerate.""What the market doesn't like, is rapid changes in the monetary landscape,"" according to David Stubbs, the global head of cross-asset thematic strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. When inflation began accelerating in early 2021, Fed officials signaled it was likely temporary, the short-term result of a hyperactive economy emerging from its pandemic hibernation.Now, their tone has shifted as inflation has lingered well above the Fed's 2% long-run target. In large part, that seems due to consumer demand for physical goods outstripping supply, as Covid continues to disrupt manufacturers.""Since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse,"" Powell said Wednesday. ""I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that,"" he added.  Investors worry an aggressive Fed response may slam the brakes on the economy — though Powell has sought to reassure the policy response will be ""nimble.""Anxiety over that outcome is the main reason for market jitters, according to CFP Lee Baker, founder of Apex Financial Services in Atlanta.""What are the trickle-down effects if the Fed raises rates too far, too fast? If it slows down the economy, what does that do to [company] earnings? You just sort of follow that domino,"" Baker said. ""If you're talking about earnings, you're talking about stocks.""(This discussion is relative to a broad basket of U.S. stocks. It's not true that all companies necessarily suffer if rates rise. Some may do better — like a bank, for example, that charges more to lend.) If rates rise, investors may see more value in bonds, certificates of deposit and other assets thought to be less risky than stocks.Yields in those conservative assets have been relatively paltry since the 2008 financial crisis, which led to a prolonged period of rock-bottom interest rates to spur the economy. Investors looking for returns were essentially ""forced"" into stocks, Baker said.The value proposition may change, if bond yields and CD rates move upward in tandem with the Fed's benchmark rate. Though it seems to play the biggest role, Fed policy isn't the only thing putting investors on edge.For one, there's the prospect of war between Ukraine and Russia. Those geopolitical tensions fuel more uncertainty — for example, how might the energy sector be impacted if fighting breaks out?The stock selloff may be a good thing, independent of what's causing it, duQuesnay said. The Federal Reserve is discussing higher interest rates because the economy and labor markets are strong; a reduction in stock prices may also tether lofty company valuations more to reality, she said.""If you take away all the outside news and information about the stock market, it's gone up double digits for three years in a row,"" according to duQuesnay. ""Maybe it should sell off despite anything else."""

Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has given an ominous warning about the volatile cryptocurrency market, comparing it to the subprime mortgage crisis of the late 2000s.In an opinion piece for The New York Times on Thursday, Krugman said he's ""seeing uncomfortable parallels"" between crypto and the U.S. subprime crash, which brought the whole housing market to its knees and triggered the 2007-2008 global financial crisis.related investing newsMorgan Stanley sees a sign that points to a top in bitcoinTanaya Macheel14 hours ago""There are disturbing echoes of the subprime crash 15 years ago,"" Krugman says in the piece.The subprime crisis was essentially the result of banks making loans out to people of higher risk, at a time when interest rates were low and house prices were soaring. Once the market became saturated, homeowners found themselves in negative equity unable to repay their loans, resulting in hefty losses for lenders.Krugman argues crypto investors are similarly being sold speculative financial products without truly understanding the risks involved. It's worth noting Krugman is a known bitcoin bear, having previously likened the cryptocurrency to a Ponzi scheme. ""Many borrowers didn't understand what they were getting into,"" he said in the NYT op-ed. ""And cryptocurrencies, with their huge price fluctuations seemingly unrelated to fundamentals, are about as risky as an asset class can get.""The Nobel laureate isn't convinced cryptocurrencies pose a systemic risk, however: ""The numbers aren't big enough to do that."" The entire crypto market is worth roughly $1.7 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.Bitcoin and other digital currencies have dropped sharply in recent weeks.

Cryptocurrency exchange FTX saw its valuation swell to $32 billion in a new funding round announced Monday, highlighting continued appetite for the sector even as investors grow wary about a sharp pullback in crypto prices.The Bahamas-based company said Monday that it raised $400 million in a Series C financing round — its third fundraise in the last nine months.FTX, which offers derivatives products as well as spot trading, is one of the world's largest digital currency exchanges. Once an obscure name, the firm has become a key player in the nascent market, rivaling the likes of Coinbase and Binance.The company doesn't offer trading in the United States. That function is provided by FTX U.S., its sister exchange. Last week, FTX U.S. announced a $400 million investment valuing the firm at $8 billion.FTX said all investors in the U.S. affiliate, which included Singaporean state investor Temasek, SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global, jumped aboard for its own fundraise.Having now raised a combined $2 billion in venture funding to date, FTX has built up a war chest at a time when digital currency prices have sunk considerably. Bitcoin is down 46% from its November record of almost $69,000, while other cryptocurrencies have slumped even further. That's led to fears the market may be on the cusp of a more severe downturn known as ""crypto winter."" The last such occurrence happened in late 2017 and early 2018, when bitcoin tanked as much as 80% from its then-record high. Bear markets are typically bad news for crypto exchanges as it means volumes tend to dry up.""I think we're not entering a long term crypto winter,"" Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's CEO and co-founder, told CNBC in an interview.""There have been changes in expectations of interest rates, and that's been moving crypto markets. But it's been moving markets more generally as well.""Indeed, stocks have taken a battering in recent weeks, with the Nasdaq down 11% year-to-date as investors reevaluate tech stocks amid concerns over higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Coinbase, FTX's publicly-listed rival, has seen its shares slide 46% since debuting on the Nasdaq last April.Asked whether his company could seek an initial public offering, Bankman-Fried said ""it's something we've been talking about.""""I'm not sure whether we will. I could see it happening, I could see it not happening. We don't feel like we have any particular need to do it.""However, he said the firm will ""try and be prepared, in case it's something that we do end up wanting to do."" Such preparations would include audited accounts and a review of possible listing options, he added.While the crypto market has seen seismic growth over the past couple of years, regulators have become increasingly wary about digital assets, concerned about their use in scams and other illicit activity. A large focus for FTX, Bankman-Fried said, is acquiring licenses in several countries. Its U.S. arm is now authorized to sell derivatives products such as futures and options, which allow investors to speculate on movements in the price of an asset. Bankman-Fried said FTX's international business will be licensed across ""the bulk of the Western world"" by the end of this year.The company plans to use the fresh funds to continue developing new products. FTX last year launched a marketplace for trading non-fungible tokens — the crypto world's answer to collectible items — and is now starting to license its software to other businesses in the realms of fintech and gaming, Bankman-Fried said.FTX said its user base grew 60% since October 2021, when it last raised money at a $25 billion valuation, while daily trading volumes rose 40% to an average of $14 billion. The company recently established a $2 billion venture fund to invest in crypto start-ups. FTX was founded almost three years ago by Bankman-Fried and fellow co-founder Gary Wang.While Bankman-Fried may have started his career as a trader at the Wall Street firm Jane Street, the crypto boss is not your typical finance executive. He lives on a vegan diet, wears t-shirts and shorts, and is based in a sunny island country.He does, however, share one similarity with traditional financial types: long working hours. Bankman-Fried previously said he functions on as little as four hours of sleep a night. He says he sleeps ""a bit more"" now, but ""not a ton.""FTX's latest investment places it among the most valuable private crypto start-ups globally.  At just 29, Bankman-Fried is one of the richest people in crypto, having amassed a net worth of over $22 billion, according to Forbes. With his shares now worth more, that figure is likely to be even higher.Bankman-Fried built an early fortune trading bitcoin at his quantitative trading firm Alameda Research. He used arbitrage, a trading strategy where investors look to profit from a divergence in prices for the same asset across different exchanges."

Silvergate Capital CEO Alan Lane told CNBC on Monday the bank holding company hopes to launch a stablecoin by the end of this year, following its acquisitions of assets and intellectual property from Mark Zuckerberg's beleaguered cryptocurrency project. The California-based financial firm, which through its subsidiary Silvergate Bank operates the crypto-focused payments platform Silvergate Exchange Network, confirmed it was buying assets from the Diem Group on Monday. Silvergate had previously been a partner on the Facebook-backed project. ""The Facebook engineers that developed this over the last couple years are truly world-class engineers,"" Lane told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer in an interview. ""We were working last year with Diem and we got to know the team very well, and we couldn't be more excited to, essentially, be taking the reigns and bringing a stablecoin to market hopefully later this year."" With Lane at the helm, Silvergate Bank is known for being one of the first traditional banks to embrace digital currencies. Its Silvergate Exchange Network offers account holders the ability to execute real-time, 24/7 transfer among themselves. Crypto trading platforms such as Coinbase Global and Gemini are part of the Silvergate Exchange Network. Lane told Cramer that Silvergate hopes to expand the everyday usefulness of stablecoins, which are a type of digital asset that has its value pegged to traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Right now, Lane said they're mostly used in crypto trading. ""We think the potential worth is off the charts when we think about using the blockchain technology for payments and remittance,"" Lane said, after Cramer asked how much Silvergate thinks Diem's assets are worth. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the bank paid about $200 million, citing an anonymous source. The Silvergate Exchange Network is already used by existing stablecoin issuers to create and redeem the digital tokens, Lane said. ""But again, those are primarily used for cryptocurrency trading. Where we see the opportunity is creating a stablecoin that could be used by folks .... to pay for things."" ""It's kind of the original promise of bitcoin, but folks don't want to be spending their bitcoin with all that volatility. But the blockchain technology is here, and we think that's what a Silvergate-issued stablecoin can provide,"" he said.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.

Businesses will be subject to the tax from June 1, 2023.The country's statutory tax rate will be 9% for taxable income exceeding 375,000 UAE dirhams ($102,000), and zero for taxable income up to that amount ""to support small businesses and startups,"" the ministry said, adding that ""the UAE corporate tax regime will be amongst the most competitive in the world.""Individuals will still not be subject to tax on their incomes from employment, real estate, equity investments or other personal income unrelated to a UAE trade or business, the ministry said. The tax also won't be applied to foreign investors who don't conduct business in the country.As for what constitutes profit, corporate tax will apply on ""the adjusted accounting net profit"" of the business.Free zone business, meanwhile — thousands of which exist in the country — can ""continue to benefit from corporate tax incentives"" as long as they ""meet all necessary requirements,"" the ministry said, without elaborating. Companies within the UAE's many free zones have long enjoyed zero taxes and full foreign ownership, among other benefits.""The UAE corporate tax regime has been designed to incorporate best practices globally and minimise the compliance burden on businesses,"" state news agency WAM wrote.""Corporate tax will be payable on the profits of UAE businesses as reported in their financial statements prepared in accordance with internationally acceptable accounting standards, with minimal exceptions and adjustments. The corporate tax will apply to all businesses and commercial activities alike, except for the extraction of natural resources which will remain subject to Emirate level corporate taxation."" While the news made waves after its announcement on Monday, many in the UAE's business scene say the development shouldn't come as a shock.""I don't think this announcement should come as a surprise; corporation tax in the UAE has been in discussion for several years. And there is already corporation tax in the GCC, in Saudi and Qatar for instance,"" Chris Payne, chief economist at Dubai-based Peninsula Real Estate, told CNBC. As the UAE, like many of its oil-rich regional counterparts, pushes to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbon revenue, ""it's important that the Federal government establishes sources of income that are not reliant on corporate dividends and investment income, both of which can be volatile,"" Payne added.The announcement gives companies in the UAE roughly a year-and-a-half to prepare for taxes, but reactions are mixed on whether the move will allow the Gulf sheikhdom to retain its attractiveness to businesses.Mark Hemmings, vice president of tax and treasury at Dubai-based specialty services firm Kent, views the decision as ""practical and sensible.""""It will be very interesting to see the detail, but at first glance this looks like a practical and sensible approach to ensure companies in the UAE can comply with the anticipated new international tax rules, whilst ensuring the UAE remains an attractive location for businesses to operate,"" Hemmings said. Still, the threshold for being subject to taxation — just over $100,000 of profit a year — is fairly low and could adversely affect smaller enterprises with high set-up and business renewal costs. Rupert Tait, co-founder of UAE-based construction tech start-up Procurified, sees potential headwinds for small businesses like his.""I think that as a start-up founder we want to base ourselves in the most affordable environment to grow,"" he told CNBC. ""While I understand the need for taxation to start, I also know we are indirectly taxed in free zones,"" he said, explaining that his company based in the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre free zone already pays 20,000 UAE dirhams (roughly $5,450) per year, which is paid regardless of profit.""So the corporate tax may cause SMEs to reconsider where they plan to remain (long-term) due to heavy upfront fees and then tax once the business is profitable,"" Tait said. Nonetheless, the proposed tax remains low compared to other low-tax hubs around the world.Montenegro and Gibraltar have tax rates of 9% and 10% respectively, while Ireland and Lichtenstein both offer a 12.5% corporate tax rate. Hong Kong's taxes range from 8.5% to 16.5%, and Singapore and San Marino both have tax rates of 17%. Still, it's yet to be seen what goods and services will be provided in exchange for the new taxes.Ultimately, the move ""brings the UAE in line with other competitive economies,"" said Taufiq Rahim, a non-resident a research fellow at the Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government in Dubai.""And the rate — while new for the private sector here — remains lower than other jurisdictions like Singapore and Hong Kong."""

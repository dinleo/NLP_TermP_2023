2022-01-04,"The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a protocol that sells nonfungible tokens (NFTs) of domains representing wallet addresses, generated buzz within the crypto community in November after it airdropped tokens to its users. Those who claimed the tokens earned governance rights over the ENS and can vote on future decisions regarding the protocol.It was so well received that it prompted other Ethereum projects to airdrop tokens too. Though airdrops aren't new, they've recently become increasingly common.In an airdrop, projects distribute tokens to specific investors' wallets. In some situations, like with the ENS, projects airdrop tokens to those who have used their product. Other times, projects airdrop tokens to potential investors in hopes of marketing their product.The process of receiving the airdropped tokens can differ too. Sometimes, investors must choose to accept the tokens by claiming them, while other times, investors cannot reject the airdrop and tokens are automatically dropped in their wallets.The ENS airdrop seems legitimate, as the ENS has existed for years and it required investors to vote on a ""foundational ENS governance constitution"" that detailed the authority of holders before claiming their tokens. But airdrops are often used by crypto scammers. In some cases, they may try to airdrop fictitious tokens to an investor's wallet to prompt them to visit a phishing website.It can be difficult to tell whether an airdrop is safe or not, and investors should be cautious. Before claiming airdropped tokens or interacting with any that may have landed in your wallet, there are a few things to do first. If you have the option to claim airdropped tokens, you should first look into the project distributing and see whether it has a viable product.Even if the airdropped token is safe to claim, its project may be designed to benefit a select few founders or core contributors. Details about a drop and its project can be found in its code, on its website or via its social media. Look into a project's fundamentals and what it proposes before connecting your wallet to its website.Both the OpenDAO and Gas DAO, two Ethereum-based projects, recently airdropped tokens, which quickly surged in value before declining. While the airdrops garnered excitement from some, others expressed concern, saying the projects behind the tokens lacked product development, utility and had security risks. This isn't uncommon.If tokens land in your wallet through an airdrop you didn't initiate, it's best to wait before engaging. Some airdrops may prompt you to visit a website to sell or swap the tokens, but there's a possibility it's a phishing attempt to access your wallet and funds. When researching, there are a few common red flags to be aware of, many of which can be seen when analyzing a project's smart contract, which are collections of code that carry out a set of instructions on the blockchain.For one, if a project lacks on-chain security to protect funds, its founders or developers might be able to control the movement of funds. This commonly happens in ""pump and dump"" or ""rug pull"" schemes, where developers abandon a project and leave with investors' funds.In addition, it might be a bad sign if a project airdropping tokens doesn't have a product, plan, governance outline or other things of that nature. Claiming tokens now with the promise of being told details later can be dangerous. While this can sometimes also be the case for early crypto projects, where there isn't any malice, it's worth keeping in mind.Project founders should be somewhat receptive to answering questions on Discord or Twitter, especially if people are calling out potential issues or concerns. If they aren't, that can be a red flag as well.Another is if a project charges a fee when you try to swap or sell the tokens, or simply doesn't allow you to swap or sell at all. Smart contracts are essential for most crypto-based projects to run. Although they can be quite technical, it's worth checking out the smart contract behind a project, or asking someone knowledgeable about the space to do so. If there is an issue with a developer's code, intentionally or not, then there could potentially be weaknesses within the project.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:You could be leaving your crypto wallet open to hackers—here's how to protect it'People have been participating without understanding the risks': Here's what to know about cryptocurrency-based DeFiElon Musk continues to tweet about altcoins like baby dogecoin—but investors should tread very carefully"

China's central bank has launched a pilot version of a wallet app for the digital yuan in a push to expand its usage to more people.The app is available on China's Android app stores and Apple's app store. It allows users to open a digital yuan wallet and spend the currency.The digital yuan or e-CNY is a digital version of China's sovereign currency and has been in the works since 2014. It is not a cryptocurrency like bitcoin but is instead issued and controlled by the People's Bank of China.So far, China has done a number of trials around the country in the form of lotteries where users in certain cities have been given a small amount of digital currency to spend. Some retailers, such as e-commerce company JD.com, have accepted it as payment in the past year.But the digital yuan has not yet officially been rolled out nationally and there is no timeline for this.The new app allows users in 10 areas including major cities Shanghai and Beijing to use it. Previously, only select users could use the app on an invitation basis. But now everyone can download the app, highlighting how China is trying to get more people to use the digital currency. The ""Beijing Winter Olympics areas"" is one of the places that the digital yuan can be used, according to a notice on the app. The Winter Olympics, which takes place this year in the Chinese capital, has been one of the events that the People's Bank of China has been targeting bringing the digital yuan to.Still, the e-CNY app will face stiff competition from China's two dominant digital payment apps — Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat."
2022-01-04,"Bitcoin could see further upside and reach $100,000 by the middle of this year, claims Antoni Trenchev of crypto lender Nexo.Bitcoin has been a winner in the pandemic era, rising more than 80% in 2021 despite being far off record highs hit earlier that year.However, some experts have warned that bitcoin may be poised for a steep drop in the coming months. Bitcoin could see further upside and surge as high as $100,000 by the middle of 2022, according to Antoni Trenchev of cryptocurrency lender Nexo.The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $46,170.43 as of 8:42 p.m. ET Monday, according to data from Coin Metrics.""I think [bitcoin's] going to reach $100,000 this year, probably by … the middle of it,"" Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at Nexo, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Monday. The firm claims to be the world's largest lending institution in the digital finance industry, according to its website. The company has issued more than $6 billion in credit and manages assets for more than 2.5 million users globally, it said.Bitcoin has largely been a winner in the pandemic era, rising more than 60% in 2021 despite being far off its record high of around $69,000 earlier that year. In comparison, the S&P 500 rose nearly 27% during the same period, while the Dow and Nasdaq gained 18.73% and 21.39% for the year, respectively.But not everyone is as bullish as Trenchev.Some experts have warned that bitcoin may be poised for a steep drop in the coming months. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, said she sees bitcoin tanking as low as $10,000 in 2022, virtually wiping out all of its gains in the past year and a half. Lingering regulatory scrutiny on the sector and wild price swings could also weigh on the outlook for bitcoin.On his part, Trenchev said there were ""two simple reasons"" why he sees big gains ahead for bitcoin.One is that institutions are ""building out their treasuries"" and filling it with the cryptocurrency, he said, without providing any examples. Firms such as MicroStrategy and Square are among known examples of companies that have bought massive amounts of bitcoin.Another reason is his prediction that ""cheap money"" is here to stay — which will be a boon for cryptocurrencies.

2022-01-05,"After a record-breaking year for cryptocurrency in 2021, many investors may soon face a hefty tax bill for their good fortune.But it can be difficult to calculate digital asset balances without Form 1099-B, summarizing profits and losses.  After a record-breaking year for cryptocurrency in 2021, many investors may soon face a hefty tax bill for their good fortune. The digital asset market value soared past $2 trillion, with bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $69,000 in November and ether surging to nearly $5,000 during the same period.While prices dipped in December, many investors still saw sizable year-over-year growth.

Loading chart... Since cryptocurrency is considered property, it may be subject to capital gains when exchanged or sold at a profit.    If you exchange digital coins, cash out to U.S. dollars or make a purchase, it may be a taxable event, said Matt Metras, an enrolled agent and cryptocurrency tax specialist at MDM Financial Services in Rochester, New York.The gain or loss is the difference between your purchase price, known as the basis, and value upon sale or exchange, and tax rates depend on how long you have owned the coin.  You may qualify for long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on taxable income, if you hold the currency for more than one year. However, selling or exchanging assets after less than one year triggers short-term capital gains, with regular income tax rates, up to 37% for top earners.And many crypto investors trade digital coins frequently, according to a CNBC survey, with roughly one-third trading weekly or monthly, and nearly a quarter trading daily.   One of the biggest crypto tax challenges is many investors don't keep records of transactions, and it's difficult for exchanges to track assets moving between wallets and brokers. For example, if you bought bitcoin on Coinbase, transferred it to your wallet and then moved it to Gemini, the second exchange wouldn't know the original purchase price, Metras said.  While the deadline for Form 1099-B, which brokers use to report an investor's profits and losses, is Jan. 31, it's unclear which crypto exchanges, if any, will send these forms for 2021.Despite limited reporting, the IRS still expects you to report crypto transactions, Markowitz said. If exchanges don't provide Form 1099-B, you may be left with each broker's spreadsheet of transactions or other reporting options, which may still be difficult to reconcile.""The best thing to do is try to reverse-engineer it,"" said Metras.You can reconstruct records by importing each exchange's files into crypto tax reporting software. ""It is overwhelming when it's a big mess,"" Metras said. ""But everything adds up eventually.""There are several companies that can provide Form 8949 to summarize crypto activity and file your returns, Markowitz said.However, errors may be possible, and the reporting may not be sufficient for an IRS audit, he added."
2022-01-05,"NFTs could become ""a much bigger, more fluid market"" than bitcoin, ""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary predicted.His belief in NFTs stems from the idea that can they prove ownership of real-world items, such as designer watches or flash cars.""We'll see what happens but I'm making that bet and I'm investing on both sides of that equation,"" O'Leary told CNBC. ""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary is a big believer in non-fungible tokens — he even thinks they have a shot at becoming bigger than bitcoin.O'Leary, the chairman of O'Shares Investment Advisers, said his belief in NFTs stems from the idea that can they prove ownership of real-world items, such as designer watches or flash cars, digitally rather than with paper records.NFTs are one-of-a-kind crypto tokens that serve to track the provenance and authenticity of rare virtual collectible items such as art and sports memorabilia. There have also been efforts to bring NFTs to physical assets.""You're going to see a lot of movement in terms of doing authentication and insurance policies and real estate transfer taxes all online over the next few years, making NFTs a much bigger, more fluid market potentially than just bitcoin alone,"" O'Leary told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" Wednesday.""We'll see what happens but I'm making that bet and I'm investing on both sides of that equation.""Barely anyone had heard of NFTs in 2020, but they became a huge phenomenon the following year. More than $20 billion worth of the tokens changed hands throughout 2021, according to some estimates. The trend gained particular public attention after a collage by the digital artist Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, was sold for a record $69 million. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of the market. Some have compared it to the initial coin offering frenzy of 2017, which saw several investors get defrauded by betting on start-ups through unregulated token sales. Meanwhile, there have been a number of scams and instances of stolen art, raising red flags for some traders. The millionaire Canadian investor has changed his tune on crypto over the years, having previously called bitcoin ""garbage.""""It is a useless currency,"" O'Leary told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in May 2019. ""It's worthless.""More recently, O'Leary has warmed to the space, viewing it as a way of diversifying from other assets such as real estate amid rising inflation. He is particularly bullish on ""decentralized finance,"" a trend that aims to replicate traditional financial products using blockchain.O'Leary recently disclosed that his largest position is in ether, while he also owns some polygon, solana and bitcoin.Around 40% of new checks O'Leary has written in the last six months were for crypto and blockchain-related ventures. O'Leary stressed the importance of ensuring crypto becomes regulated. Regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere are racing to catch up with developments in the market to prevent potential money laundering and protect consumers from financial harm.""Different geographies have different policy regarding crypto,"" O'Leary said. ""You have to go and find jurisdictions that are more progressive."" He cited Canada, his home country, as an example of a jurisdiction that is more progressive than others on the issue of crypto.Canada was the first to approve an exchange-traded fund that gives investors exposure to bitcoin. Though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has since greenlit a bitcoin-linked ETF, the product tracks futures contracts instead of investing in bitcoin directly.O'Leary also cited the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland as other countries that are opening up to crypto.""You have to be optimistic and constructive,"" O'Leary said. ""The floodgate of capital will come in through sovereign and pension plans that doesn't exist yet.""Of particular concern to regulators are stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to the value of sovereign currencies like the dollar. Economists worry notable stablecoins like tether and USD Coin may not have the appropriate reserves available to justify their claims of being backed by dollars.""I think [stablecoins] will also get a chance to shine in the sun as a great way to get yield when you can't get any yield on cash,"" O'Leary said."

He said it can be compared to gold, because, by design, there is a limited supply of bitcoin.""I think over time, inflation-hedge assets are probably likely to do better,"" Dalio told Green. ""That's why I'm not favorable to cash and those types of things.""Diversification is extremely important, Dalio told Green. But even when it comes to bitcoin, ""one wonders, when does somebody take the money they made in bitcoin and then diversify that?

2022-01-06,"The second-biggest country for bitcoin mining lost its internet access, taking as much as 15% of the network offline.Kazakhstan is home to coal mines that provide a cheap and abundant supply of energy, which is a major incentive to miners who compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy.Bitcoin fell below $43,000 for the first time since September in trade on Thursday, falling over 8% at one point. As the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan plunged into chaos this week, an internet shutdown hit the world's second-biggest bitcoin mining hub, in yet another blow to miners searching for a permanent and stable home.Less than a year ago, China banished all of its cryptocurrency miners, many of whom sought refuge in neighboring Kazakhstan. But months after these crypto migrants set up shop, protests over surging fuel prices have morphed into the worst unrest the country has seen in decades, leaving crypto miners caught in the middle.After sacking his government and requesting the aid of Russian paratroopers to contain the fatal violence, president Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev ordered the nation's telecom provider to shutter internet service. That shutdown took an estimated 15% of the world's bitcoin miners offline, according to Kevin Zhang of digital currency company Foundry, which helped bring over $400 million of mining equipment into North America.As Kazakh miner Didar Bekbau put it, ""No internet, so no mining.""Bitcoin dropped below $43,000 for the first time since September in trade on Thursday, falling over 8% at one point. The price move followed the release of hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting. Castle Island Ventures' Nic Carter thinks the supply delta from changing the pace of mining is minimal and that the falling price of bitcoin is more a function of the Fed and ""general risk-off behavior.""Internet service was briefly restored in the country, but data from monitoring group NetBlocks Internet Observatory shows that connectivity levels continue to flatline at just 5% of ordinary levels across the country.""It's now Friday morning in Kazakhstan where internet has been shut down for some 36 hours, placing public safety at risk and leaving friends and family cut off,"" NetBlocks wrote in a tweet.The entire episode lays bare two significant facts about the state of the bitcoin mining industry. For one, the bitcoin network is resilient to the point that it doesn't skip a beat, even when a substantial portion of miners are unexpectedly taken offline. Second, the U.S. may soon see a fresh influx of crypto miners looking to avoid future disruptions. The question now is whether the U.S., which eclipsed China as the planet's largest bitcoin mining hub in 2021, has the room to take in any more miners.""What's concerning is that previous congestion and bottlenecks around hosting capacity (readily available space to plug machines into) will be squeezed that much tighter,"" explained Zhang.""There's a tremendous amount of pressure and demand for hosting capacity,"" he said. When Beijing kicked out all its bitcoin miners in May 2021, Kazakhstan seemed like a logical destination. Beyond the fact that it was right next door, the country is also a major energy producer.Mining is the energy-intensive computing process used to create new coins and maintain a log of all transactions. Kazakhstan is home to coal mines that provide a cheap and abundant supply of energy, which is a major incentive to miners who compete in a low-margin industry where their only variable cost is typically energy.It also helps that the Kazakh government typically has a more lax attitude about building, which is good for for miners who need to construct physical installations in a short period of time.  Bekbau runs Xive, a company that provides hosting services to international miners and sells the specialized equipment needed for mining. In the last several months, he's fielded countless inbounds from Chinese miners looking for a safe place to plug in their gear.Kazakhstan is just behind the U.S. in terms of its share of the global bitcoin mining market, with 18.1% of all crypto mining, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.But the government hasn't exactly been thrilled about its burgeoning crypto mining industry.For months, Kazakh lawmakers have been setting down new rules to discourage mining, including a law that will introduce extra taxes for crypto miners starting in 2022. Experts expect the move will significantly change the incentives for people looking to deploy capital inside Kazakhstan.""The internet outage comes at the heels of efforts to impose a de facto ban on new mining in the country, so miners will have been well aware of the political risk there,"" said Carter.""These bans just underscore why miners are increasingly locating themselves in politically stable jurisdictions,"" continued Carter. Several mining experts also tell CNBC they think that Kazakhstan was always intended to be a temporary stopover on a longer migration west.Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners, said that large miners were going to Kazakhstan in the short-term with older equipment.""But as older-generation machines reach the end of their service lives, those companies will likely deploy new machines into more stable and energy efficient and renewable jurisdictions,"" Brammer said.The U.S. has fast become a mecca for crypto mining, in part because it is home to some of the cheapest sources of energy on the planet, many of which tend to be renewable.If miners do make their way west, it could bode well for the larger debate around bitcoin's carbon footprint.Carter points out that Kazakh energy is carbon-intensive, so just like the Chinese ban, a prolonged outage in the Central Asian country would likely have the net effect of further decarbonizing bitcoin mining.But not all are convinced of an imminent crypto mining exodus from Kazakhstan. Alan Dorjiyev is president of the National Association of Blockchain and Data Centers Industry in Kazakhstan, whose membership is mostly comprised of mining companies. Dorjiyev tells CNBC that after speaking to owners of mining farms across the country, it is his understanding that most data centers are safe, because they are located in regions where there are no protests.Bekbau also remains optimistic, tweeting that he hopes by next week, ""everything will be okay.""Whether miners make the move out of Central Asia or not, industry experts tell CNBC that the biggest takeaway of this entire ordeal is the fact that bitcoin mining has yet again survived another stress test with little drama.""As we saw with China, when a country demonstrates it's unstable for mining bitcoin, miners in that country will move elsewhere,"" said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi, who now runs Meow, a company that enables corporate treasury participation in crypto markets.""This is how the bitcoin network gets more resilient over time. Miners migrate towards the most favorable jurisdictions, making disruptions less and less frequent."""

2022-01-06,"Scammers around the world took home a record $14 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021, thanks in large part to the rise of DeFi.Losses from crypto-related crime rose 79% from 2020.Cryptocurrency theft increased 516% from 2020, to $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Of this total, 72% of stolen funds were taken from DeFi protocols. Scammers took home a record $14 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021, thanks in large part to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, according to new data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.Losses from crypto-related crime rose 79% from a year earlier, driven by a spike in theft and scams.Scamming was the greatest form of cryptocurrency-based crime in 2021, followed by theft — most of which occurred through hacking of cryptocurrency businesses. The firm says that DeFi is a big part of the story for both, in yet another warning for those dabbling in this emerging segment of the crypto industry.""DeFi is one of the most exciting areas of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, presenting huge opportunities to entrepreneurs and cryptocurrency users alike,"" Chainalysis wrote in its annual Crypto Crime report.""But DeFi is unlikely to realize its full potential if the same decentralization that makes it so dynamic also allows for widespread scamming and theft."" DeFi is a rapidly growing sector of the crypto market that aims to cut out middlemen, such as banks, from traditional financial transactions, like securing a loan.With DeFi, banks and lawyers are replaced by a programmable piece of code called a smart contract. This contract is written on a public blockchain, like ethereum or solana, and it executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary. ""The financial system is basically sending money around with various terms and conditions attached to it,"" said Joey Krug, chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, a cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused asset manager. DeFi transaction volume grew 912% in 2021, according to Chainalysis stats. Impressive returns on decentralized tokens like shiba inu also spurred a feeding frenzy among DeFi tokens.But there are a lot of red flags when it comes to dealing in this nascent crypto ecosystem.One problem with DeFi, according to Kim Grauer, Chainalysis' head of research, is that many of the new protocols being launched have code vulnerabilities that hackers are able to exploit. Twenty-one percent of all hacks in 2021 took advantage of these code exploits.Grauer tells CNBC that while there are third-party firms that perform code audits and publicly designate which protocols are secure, many users still opt to work with risky platforms that bypass this step if they think they can get a large return.Cryptocurrency theft rose 516% from 2020, to $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Of this total, 72% of stolen funds were taken from DeFi protocols.Losses from scams climbed 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency.More than $2.8 billion of this total came from a relatively new but very popular type of scheme known as a ""rug pull,"" in which developers build what appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency projects, before ultimately taking investors' money and disappearing.""Given the hype around DeFi, people may have been more OK with using less secure platforms due to a fear of missing out on potential gains,"" explained Grauer. Crypto-related crime may be at an all-time high, but researchers note that the growth of legitimate cryptocurrency usage far outstrips the growth of criminal usage.Transactions involving illicit addresses represented an all-time low of just 0.15% of the $15.8 trillion in total crypto trade volume in 2021.The research firm identifies illicit funds based on their connection to confirmed illicit activity. For example, funds would be considered illicit if they were sent to or from a darknet market, or were known to have been stolen in a hack.""The fact that the increase was just 79% — nearly an order of magnitude lower than overall adoption — might be the biggest surprise of all,"" Chainalysis wrote.""Crime is becoming a smaller and smaller part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem,"" continued the report.Researchers partly credit the curbed growth of crypto-based crime to the evolving toolkit of law enforcement, as well as the inherit transparency of blockchain technologies.Crime is becoming a smaller and smaller part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Chainalysis2021 Crypto Crime ReportUnlike cash and other traditional forms of value transfer, every transaction is recorded in a publicly visible ledger, and with the right tools, Grauer says that it is possible to see how much of all cryptocurrency activity is associated with crime.""Authorities have been enormously successful in leveraging the transparency of blockchains to investigate and shut down illicit activity,"" said Grauer.In November, for example, the IRS Criminal Investigation agency said that it had seized more than $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2021 — all from nontax investigations — representing 93% of all funds seized by the division during that time period.Other wins for law enforcement in 2021 included the Department of Justice's $56 million seizure in a cryptocurrency scam investigation, $2.3 million seized from the ransomware group behind the Colonial Pipeline attack, as well as an undisclosed amount seized by Israel's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing in a case related to terrorism financing."

It was built by Nile Niami, a Hollywood-producer-turned-developer, who promoted it as the ""biggest and most expensive modern home in America,"" with an eventual asking price of $500 million. As costs soared, Niami's debt on the house grew to more than $180 million. The megamansion was placed into receivership last year. As part of a bankruptcy agreement struck last month, it was scheduled to be sold at an auction, beginning Feb. 7. People involved in the court process said ""The One"" would have to sell for around $200 million just to pay back the debt, including the auction fees and other costs. If it sells for less, the lenders may have to take a loss, or the property could wind up in further foreclosure litigation. Yet lenders and brokers hope the property is coming to market at an ideal time. Luxury real estate in Los Angeles is breaking records. Sales of properties priced at $10 million or more doubled in 2021 compared with 2019, before the pandemic, with a total of 312 sales, according to Miller Samuel. Marc Andreesen just set a record in California after he paid $177 million for a compound in Malibu, while Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong paid $133 million for a modern mansion, located near ""The One"" in Bel Air.Brokers say interest in ""The One"" has already been strong. Williams said he has two offers on the table — one from a Saudi royal and one from a wealthy Chinese buyer. He said more offers are expected soon from crypto buyers who are ""looking at this house as their own space station."" ""There is going to be huge demand for this property,"" he said. ""Demand for U.S. real estate is through the roof because the dollar is weak and people want real tangible assets.""Kirman added that the property is more than a house — it's a full-scale private resort for ""the billionaire buyer who wants all-inclusive living."" The home sits on 3.8 acres and features 21 bedrooms and 42 bathrooms. Built on a leveled mountain, it has views of the Pacific Ocean, downtown Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Mountains. It has seven water features, including a massive moat that runs around the property. It has a nightclub, a full-service beauty salon, a wellness spa, a home theater that seats 40, a bowling alley, a 10,000-bottle wine cellar, 30-car garage and a 400-foot private outdoor running track. For guests or staff, it has a three-bedroom guest house with its own infinity pool.Still, any buyer of ""The One"" will also have to contend with a thicket of financial and legal issues. According to the receiver's report and an engineering study, the house has cracks in and around many of the pools and stonework, as well as signs of mold. It has several outstanding building and occupancy permits, and a local homeowner's association is challenging its construction. In part because of ""The One"" and other megamansions built nearby, local building laws were changed in recent years to prevent other supersized homes from ever being built again — which brokers say only adds to the value of ""The One."" The lenders also continue to battle each other in bankruptcy court over procedures and priority. Niami weighed in with his own last-ditch effort last month, releasing a video saying he hoped to turn the home into a crypto investment, selling a new token to investors called ""The One Coin"" that would be backed by the property. ""Hopefully, there's someone out there that is going to want to walk hand in hand with me into the stratosphere,"" Niami said in a video. He declined further comment, and lenders and lawyers have dismissed Niami's plans.Ultimately, Kirman said, the 10 years of drama around the house won't deter buyers once they tour the property. ""Its controversial history is no secret,"" he said. ""But when a potential buyer walks the site they'll see the opportunity is so extraordinary that the past won't really matter anymore.""The auction, held by Concierge Auctions, is scheduled to run Feb. 7-10. Bidders would have to wire $250,000 and show proof of funds to qualify for bidding."
2022-01-07,"Victims of the $200 million BitMart hack say that five weeks have passed since the crypto exchange vowed to return their money.In early December, BitMart wrote in an official statement that it would use its own money to reimburse victims of the large-scale security breach, which the exchange blamed on a stolen private key.Many BitMart customers say they haven't received any form of reimbursement. Victims of the $200 million BitMart hack say that five weeks have passed since the crypto exchange vowed to return their money, but many still haven't seen a dime.""I'm not one to bitch and moan a lot,"" said Paul DeLong, a business owner in Austin. ""BitMart, from a communication perspective, they said that they were going to give us more updates. We have not received any updates at all.""DeLong says he has reached out to the exchange multiple times, and each time, he's received a canned response from a bot to inform him that BitMart and their attorneys are ""working on it.""In early December, BitMart wrote in an official statement that it would use its own money to reimburse victims of the large-scale security breach, which the exchange blamed on a stolen private key.But users are getting restless waiting for BitMart to make good on its promise.CNBC spoke to multiple BitMart users who were targets of the attack, some of whom face total financial ruin if their funds aren't retrieved.""Whether it's $20, $500, $10,000, it doesn't matter, just communicate back to us, and let us know,"" said DeLong.Many of the victims lost a particular token known as safemoon, which is a cryptocurrency token built on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. The coin saw a massive run-up in the second quarter of 2021 after a slew of celebrity endorsements from the likes of rapper Lil Yachty and YouTuber Jake Paul.CNBC reached out to ask whether BitMart still planned to make good on its promise to reimburse victims. The email address of BitMart CEO Sheldon Xia, which he lists on his unverified Twitter profile, bounced back, just as it did when CNBC first reached out to Xia in early December.A spokesperson replied, ""We will support all user withdrawals. We're also talking to multiple project teams to confirm the most reasonable solutions such as token swaps. Any further updates will be announced on our official website."" The company did not respond to more detailed questions. CNBC talked to more than a dozen BitMart users personally affected by the breach. One common theme across many of these conversations was a desire for transparency. The shared feeling was that bad news was better than no news.One BitMart user, who said he felt his tokens were ""being held hostage,"" sent CNBC a screenshot of his exchange with the admin who runs BitMart's Telegram account. When he asked Thursday evening whether there was any further guidance on when he would be receiving his safemoon tokens back, the reply read, ""We'll announce when there's an update.""Toronto-based Mohamad, who asked that CNBC just refer to him by his first name, said he feels close to committing suicide because of his experience with BitMart.The Iranian refugee has $53,000 worth of the safemoon token stored on his BitMart wallet, $40,000 of which came from a loan that he has to pay back with 4% interest.The 38-year-old tells CNBC that from 7 A.M. until 10 P.M., seven days a week, he works as a tow truck driver for a road side assistance company. He says he has to work long hours because his employer pays him a per-job commission rather than an hourly wage. He gets $20 per job, but he has to pay for his own diesel fuel.He began to invest in cryptocurrencies to try to carve out a future for himself in Canada.""I just was thinking I can grow my money, then I can go to school to learn English and go to college,"" Mohamad shared with CNBC. ""I don't have any savings.""Another BitMart user tells CNBC that it is not just his money at stake. His mother and mother-in-law pooled together $30,000 and asked him to invest the cash in BitMart on their behalf.""After I put it in, the freaking hack happened, so I was going crazy, because I didn't have anything to give them,"" he said.New York-based ""Mr. Blik,"" who also asked not to use his real name, tells CNBC the timing couldn't have been worse.""This happened close to the holidays...People sometimes have to liquidate some of their positions to cover expenses, to buy things for kids for Christmas. Their inability to make people whole really created an environment where that freedom that we all strive for was taken away from us,"" Mr. Blik said.One Kansas-based crypto investor, who has around $35,000 stuck in BitMart, told CNBC he wasn't terribly worried until recently.""There was some general understanding, even patience, from holders that BitMart was merely waiting until after the first of the year to re-purchase the stolen hot wallet tokens for tax reasons,"" he said.This same BitMart customer now says he is in touch with around 6,800 holders who are considering filing a class-action suit against the exchange. They are giving it about a week until they take action. The company's vagueness has helped fire up the so-called ""Safemoon Army"" — a term given to the community of safemoon token holders, who have historically proven to be a formidable force when they coalesce around a cause.The BitMart hackers made off with a mix of more than 45 coins, but safemoon tokens accounted for a hefty portion of the spoils. While some BitMart users have reported reimbursements for tokens like saitama, safemoon holders remain in limbo.Safemoon investors using BitMart also say they haven't received their ""reflection"" payments — a dividend-like perk distributed to existing holders of the token — since November. BitMart's safemoon investors are therefore feeling doubly burned.Even safemoon holders who have never used BitMart feel they've been indirectly burned by the breach.One United States Air Force veteran made the point that when the hacker stole the safemoon coins and sold them all on the open market, it dropped the price of the entire project. ""We're all affected by this,"" he said.The Safemoon Army is pressuring BitMart through a Twitter campaign designed to shame the exchange into following through on paying back victims of the hack. The safemoon contingent is pushing the Twitter hashtag #WenBitMart, which began trending on Monday night.Although BitMart told CNBC it would support token exchanges, victims say that could cost them money.One person said that if he liquidates his tokens on BitMart to USDT (a popular stablecoin pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar), he would do so at a market position that is one-third of where his safemoon tokens trade today. He would also face a 10% fee for making the trade because of safemoon's trading requirements. (This 10% transaction tax serves as an incentive for users to keep holding the token, which helps put a floor under its price. They also fund dividends that the token creators pay holders as an added incentive.)Even if BitMart does make good and pay everyone back, it remains to be seen whether the exchange will repurchase the equivalent assets lost at their current prices, which in some cases, could be significantly higher.Safemoon's global head of products is himself a BitMart customer. Ryan Arriaga says that 15% of his safemoon stash is on BitMart. But he believes the exchange will do the right thing.""It's not like it was four or five years ago, where a lot of these people who were involved are anonymous...People are wisening up to the space, they understand it more, they can read contracts better,"" said Arriaga.""We've come such a long way now that I believe that BitMart will keep their promise and do the right thing...Especially with the safemoon army, we have such a great support for what we're trying to achieve that it wouldn't die down. It won't only add more fuel to the fire."" As BitMart customers wait for answers, some are biding the time by going deep on the crypto exchange itself. CNBC participated in a Twitter Spaces chat on Wednesday night in which nearly 700 people discussed the situation.BitMart closed a $13.7 million Series B funding round at the end of 2021 at a $300 million valuation, giving pause to some who wonder how the exchange is equipped to self-fund reimbursements of $200 million to customers.Others have asked why BitMart isn't going through insurance to reimburse stolen funds. CNBC put that question to BitMart, and the exchange declined to respond.CNBC also asked if the exchange was running an internal audit to gauge whether anything ran afoul within its own ranks, and again, BitMart opted not to respond to that question.The December hack affected two of BitMart's ""hot wallets,"" but other assets were apparently ""safe and unharmed.""Cryptocurrency can be stored ""hot,"" ""cold,"" or some combination of the two. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and allows owners relatively easy access to their coins so that they can access and spend their crypto. The trade-off for convenience is potential exposure to bad actors.The final and resounding concern among many BitMart users is that instead of halting trading of the affected and non-collateralized tokens, BitMart only stopped withdrawals. CNBC has seen a video in which one person purchased safemoon tokens on the exchange on Jan. 5, well after the hack."

Here's how the pros are playing itJoshua Natolia day agoThe world's largest cryptocurrency began falling earlier this week after the minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting hinted the U.S. central bank would dial back its pandemic-era stimulus.The hawkish comments triggered a sell-off in global stock markets which spilled over into cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin bulls often describe it as an asset that is uncorrelated to traditional financial markets, however experts have noticed growing parallels in the price movements of bitcoin and stocks.Other digital currencies continued to slide Friday, with ethereum shedding 6.8% and solana falling 7.7%. Another piece of news weighing on crypto prices is the Kazakhstan president's move to shutter internet service following deadly protests against the government.The Central Asian country accounts for 18% of the bitcoin network's processing power, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. Many crypto miners fled China for neighboring Kazakhstan over Beijing's ban on virtual currency mining.Kazakhstan's internet shutdown took as much as 15% of the network offline, according to some estimates.Bitcoin's computing power ""is not directly correlated to the price of Bitcoin, but it gives an indication of the network's security, so a fall can spook investors in the short term,"" Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in a note Thursday. - CNBC's Mackenzie Sigalos contributed to this report"
2022-01-10,"The price of bitcoin fell at one point Monday to its lowest level since September, as rising rates continued leading investors to shed positions in risky, growth-oriented assets.Bitcoin fell as much as 6% to touch a low of $39,771.91, according to Coin Metrics, reclaiming most of its losses. It traded about 1.3% lower at $41,904.87 around 4 p.m. ET. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, also took back losses. It tumbled as low as $2,940 in the morning and last traded 3.4% lower at $3,090.67.Declines across the cryptocurrency market follow a week of rough trading for equities, particularly momentum stocks. As the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield spiked to start 2022, investors have been rotating into more cyclical and value names. On Monday, the 10-year climbed as high as 1.8%, after ending 2021 at 1.5%.""We've seen bitcoin behave like a risk asset on numerous occasions over the past few months,"" said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis. ""When the market gets jittery, bitcoin tumbles. We've seen various indications that market sentiment is somewhat spooked by the spike in the 10-year — that's not good for any asset that has high volatility in cash flows. Unlike many assets that are tainted by this brush, bitcoin is liquid and therefore can take more selling pressure without a heavy hit.""Bitcoin hit a record high near $69,000 in November, after a hot inflation reading that at the time showed the biggest jump in consumer prices in 30 years. That reading caused investors to jump into inflation hedges, including bitcoin and gold.Because of the way the cryptocurrency has traded in tandem with equities, investors more than ever are split on whether bitcoin serves as a sound inflation hedge. Last week, Goldman Sachs said it sees bitcoin taking market share from gold and potentially climbing to $100,000.Cryptocurrency prices have fallen steadily since November, however, with bitcoin dropping about 40%. Bitcoin added to its losses last week, after the Federal Reserve indicated its intentions to begin reducing its balance sheet, in addition to what investors have already been preparing for — its tapering of bonds and raising interest rates.""The crypto market looks to be moving in line with the broader macro environment right now, most likely due to increasing overlapping institutional investor base, such as macro funds that allocate to crypto as well,"" said Juthica Chou, head of over-the-counter options trading at Kraken.Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman noted that bitcoin has been diverging from other crypto assets and suggested its moves reflect more about the macro environment and equities than they do about decentralized finance, Ethereum-alternative protocols, NFTs and the metaverse and other crypto sectors and altcoins.""The market dynamic of bitcoin has changed a lot in the last two years,"" he said. ""It went from being largely, you know, crypto native ... now, it really just trades as a 24/7 levered VIX. It's much more important to those who care about the S&P and the big Treasurys, and you're seeing that every day in the price action.""Crypto stocks also fell Monday. Coinbase fell about 3.2%. Crypto banks Silvergate and Signature lost 4% and 3%, respectively."
2022-01-10,"Tech firms will benefit from the metaverse, Web 3.0, cryptocurrencies and quantum computing if they operate in those areas, according to Cyrus Mewawalla, head of thematic research at GlobalData. ""If you're in that space, you're going to benefit almost regardless of macroeconomic issues,"" he said. Apple saw its share price rise to $3 trillion last week but the iPhone maker may not grow as quickly as some of its rivals this year, according to Mewawalla.  Large U.S. tech stocks will shrug off inflation and keep on rising this year thanks to several emerging technologies, according to Cyrus Mewawalla, head of thematic research at data analytics and consultancy firm GlobalData.Tech firms will benefit from the metaverse, Web 3.0, cryptocurrencies and quantum computing if they operate in those areas, Mewawalla told CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe"" Monday.""If you're in that space, you're going to benefit almost regardless of macroeconomic issues,"" he said.On Monday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped nearly 1%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are coming off four straight days of losses. The rough start to the year for stocks has come as interest rates have spiked.Big Tech firms are investing billions into new technologies that have the potential to fundamentally change the way we live and work.At the end of last year, Facebook changed its name to Meta to reflect its focus on the so-called metaverse: a virtual world where humans would interact with one another through digital avatars that can be controlled through virtual reality headsets like Oculus. Elsewhere, firms like Google and Microsoft have also developed VR headsets, while Apple is rumored to be working on one.Several of the tech giants are researching commercial applications for quantum computers, while Meta is planning to launch a cryptocurrency called Diem. So far, most of them have remained quiet on Web 3.0, which is being hailed as the next version of the internet. Last week, Apple saw its valuation rise to more than $3 trillion, making it the most valuable U.S. stock ever and the biggest tech company in the world by some margin. But the iPhone maker's share price may not grow as much as some of the other Big Tech firms this year, according to Mewawalla.""Apple is probably the least likely to grow from here in terms of maintaining its valuation,"" he said. ""It's got a very, very strong ecosystem with very strong execution. So I see very little downside risk. But the upside potential I see more in other big tech stocks."" Asked if there are going to be more surprises to the upside this year with Apple, Mewawalla said CEO Tim Cook has been ""absolutely phenomenal"" over the last 10 years, taking its market cap from around $350 billion to $3 trillion.""But in that time, there's been almost no innovation apart from possibly the Apple Watch, whose operating system operating system is an extension really of iOS,"" he said. ""The Apple TV was a bit of a flop in terms of there wasn't a real new big blockbuster product. Now there's talk of new blockbuster products like an electric car. It may be an autonomous car. Smart glasses, something to do with the metaverse perhaps. But until we see more evidence of that, and of course Apple is notoriously secretive, it's very hard to say.""Meanwhile, Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet are the most exposed in terms of regulation, Mewawalla said, adding that they face a wide range of issues including data, privacy, antitrust and copyright. That said, he doesn't see anything ""major"" happening in the near term.On acquisitions, Mewawalla said they will become ""highly restricted"" in the future, adding that the U.K. and other countries are introducing new M&A laws to prevent companies from becoming too big and powerful.""I think acquisition strategy is going to have to change and it's going to have to take account of greater regulatory scrutiny,"" he said."

Former aides to Sen. Joe Manchin who are now lobbyists are scoring big, influential clients as their ex-boss battles President Biden's agenda.Three of Manchin's previous advisors have recently registered to lobby for at least five new clients: gas and oil giant Hess, media juggernaut Comcast, a nonprofit founded by a former campaign manager for Mike Bloomberg, a group with ties to former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, and an organization partially funded by crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried. The billionaire gave $5 million to a pro-Biden political action committee during the 2020 election.The former aides – including former chiefs of staff to Manchin – registered to lobby for some of these new clients starting in October, while registering for others as recently as December, according to disclosure reports reviewed by CNBC. The lobbying registrations came as Manchin's own influence grew. Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, opposed key elements of President Joe Biden's proposals during the October-December period. Several of the issues listed on the lobbying disclosure forms are related to the Democratic Party's agenda, such as the child tax credit, income tax and greater access to broadband.

Manchin's vote is critical for Democrats in a 50-50 Senate. The West Virginia lawmaker has since said he's had no talks with top Democrats about revisiting the plan.Several of the Manchin-linked lobbyists have previously engaged people on Capitol Hill on behalf of power players in industries such as coal, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, tobacco and finance.A spokeswoman for Comcast declined to comment. The lobbyists and representatives for the new clients did not return requests for comment. Comcast hired Larry Puccio, who counts himself as a friend of Manchin's, to lobby on what's described on the registration form as ""telecommunications – broadband deployment and adoption."" Puccio registered to lobby for Comcast in late November and was Manchin's chief of staff when he was governor of West Virginia.Biden recently signed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that includes $550 billion in new money that is targeted toward transportation, broadband and utilities.In a 2020 interview with a local news outlet in West Virginia, Puccio, a longtime lobbyist, discussed his friendship with Manchin. ""Joe and I are very close. I think the world of Joe. I hope you print that. I've always been supportive of Joe Manchin. Joe knows me and I know Joe,"" Puccio said at the time.Hess recently hired Patrick Hayes, who was Manchin's chief of staff until 2019. Hayes registered to lobby for the oil and gas giant in December.

The lobbying firm says Hayes and his colleagues registered to lobby for Tusk Philanthropies in October with a focus on ""initiatives related to ending childhood hunger including the Community Eligibility Provision.""Records show that Tusk Philanthropies has hired lobbyists in the past to try to fight for their priorities. The group's website lists fighting child hunger as one of its goals. The site says the group has been ""able to help pass legislation in Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Arizona, California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington state.""Former presidential contender and New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang launched a nonprofit called Humanity Forward after he dropped out of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. The 501(c)(4) recently hired Puccio to focus on the child tax credit, according to the registration form. Puccio registered to lobby for the Yang backed group in early December.The expansion of the child tax credit was a major feature of Biden's social spending proposal that has since stalled largely due to Manchin's opposition.The group's website says that the organization has been actively working to expand the provision as it is set to expire.""Humanity Forward worked with partner organizations and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to pass the expanded monthly Child Tax Credit payments as part of the American Rescue Plan Act and is actively advancing efforts to prevent its expiration in December 2021,"" the website says.

Borg, Alabama Securities Commission Director.The annual survey of North American securities regulators urged investors to exercise caution before purchasing popular and volatile unregulated investments, especially those involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.""The most common telltale sign of an investment scam is an offer of guaranteed high returns with no risk. It is important for investors to understand what they are investing in and with whom they are investing,"" said Melanie Senter Lubin, NASAA President and Maryland Securities Commissioner.""Education and information are an investor's best defense against investment fraud,"" continued Lubin.The report added that digital assets ""do not fall neatly into the existing investor regulatory framework,"" so it may be easier for promoters of these products ""to fleece the public."" ""Before you jump into the crypto craze, be mindful that cryptocurrencies and related financial products may be nothing more than public facing fronts for Ponzi schemes and other frauds,"" said Enforcement Section Committee Vice-Chair Joseph Rotunda.Rotunda added that investments in cryptocurrency trading programs, interests in crypto mining pools, crypto depository accounts and securitized tokens should ""be seen for what they are: extremely risky speculation with a high risk of loss.""Scammers took home a record $14 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021, thanks in large part to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.DeFi is a rapidly growing sector of the crypto market that aims to cut out middlemen, such as banks, from traditional financial transactions, like securing a loan, by using blockchain technology.Losses from crypto-related crime rose 79% from a year earlier, driven by a spike in theft and scams.Scamming was the greatest form of cryptocurrency-based crime in 2021, followed by theft — most of which occurred through hacking of cryptocurrency businesses. Chainalysis says that DeFi is a big part of the story for both, in yet another warning for those dabbling in this emerging segment of the crypto industry.NASAA noted that many of the fraud threats facing investors today involve private offerings, which are exempted from federal law registration requirements. States are also preempted from enforcing investor protection laws related to these private securities.""Unregistered private offerings generally are high-risk investments and don't have the same investor protection requirements as those sold through public markets,"" said Borg.Ultimately, state securities regulators say that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.Some DeFi platforms, for example, offer users huge returns, such as high-interest rate savings and lending products.Bad actors often entice new investors by promising the payment of safe, lucrative, guaranteed returns over relatively short terms – ""sometimes measured in hours or days instead of months or years,"" according to NASAA, which says these kinds of promises are a red flag for fraud.Fraud offerings tied to promissory notes, money scams offered online and via social media, as well as financial schemes connected to self-directed Individual Retirement Accounts rounded out the survey's list of the top threats to retail investors."
2022-01-12,"New documents show that in 2019 Jared Kushner was quietly advocating for a U.S. digital dollar, according to a 250-page dump of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's crypto-related e-mail correspondence from his four years in the job.Kushner's apparent affinity for digital currencies is one of many revelations gleaned from this newly released document that was obtained by CoinDesk through a Freedom of Information Act request.Other insights include details surrounding the fight between the crypto lobby and Mnuchin over the Treasury Department’s last-minute attempt at rolling out new rules pertaining to user-controlled digital wallets. New documents show that one of former President Donald Trump's most trusted and senior advisors was secretly pushing the White House to lean into crypto, well before skyrocketing crypto prices reignited mainstream interest in the space.In 2019, when crypto was in the midst of a multiyear bear market, Jared Kushner — Trump's son-in-law and a senior adviser — was quietly advocating for a U.S. digital dollar, in which the Fed would launch its own central bank currency.The information was gleaned from a 250-page dump of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's crypto-related e-mail correspondence from his four years in the job, which was was obtained by CoinDesk through a Freedom of Information Act request.Other insights include details surrounding the fight between the crypto lobby and Mnuchin over the Treasury Department's last-minute attempt at rolling out new rules pertaining to user-controlled digital wallets.Neither Mnuchin nor Kushner immediately responded to CNBC's request for comment about their crypto-related email exchanges. On May 29, 2019, Kushner, who was more known for his work on the administration's foreign-policy efforts rather than fiscal matters, sent an e-mail to Mnuchin to suggest that a group be assembled to ""have a brainstorm"" about the topic of a U.S. digital currency.The note included a link to a blog post by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in which Altman argues that while the U.S. government cannot stop cryptocurrency, it can ""create the winner."" In the post, Altman riffed on a hypothetical U.S. digital currency, or USDC, which would function as a second legal currency. He goes on to say that if the U.S. was the first superpower government to launch a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, it would have an ""enviable position in the future of the world"" and exercise some degree of power over a worldwide currency.""My sense is it could make sense and also be something that could ultimately change the way we pay out entitlements as well saving us a ton in waste fraud and also in transaction costs,"" Kushner wrote.There was no reply from Mnuchin among the documents, so it is unclear whether the Treasury secretary took any action.Kushner's view on the CBDC phenomenon ultimately proved prescient.Few countries were seriously dabbling in national digital currencies in mid-2019, but today, at least 87 countries representing over 90% of global GDP are exploring a CBDC, according to research from the Atlantic Council.China is miles ahead of the rest of the world, having spent years developing and piloting its digital yuan. Beijing is currently in the process of ramping up efforts to roll out the so-called e-CNY to the broader population, with the ultimate goal of replacing cash and coins already in circulation.In the years since Kushner floated the idea of a digital dollar, talk of a CBDC in the U.S. has circulated among regulators and lawmakers, though with few tangible steps toward implementation.During a two-day congressional hearing in July, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the main incentive for the U.S. to launch its own CBDC would be to eliminate the case for crypto coins in America.""You wouldn't need stablecoins; you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies, if you had a digital U.S. currency,"" Powell said. ""I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""America's most likely path on CBDC would be to create a digital twin of the dollar, observers say. It would be fully regulated, under a central authority, and with the full faith and backing of the country's central bank.""A dollar in CBDC form is a liability of the central bank. The Federal Reserve has to pay you back,"" explained Ronit Ghose, who heads FinTech and digital assets for Citi Global Insights.Though former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo has since taken up the cause for a digital dollar, the full commitment of the Fed remains in doubt. Powell previously told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that he was not convinced that the benefits outweigh the costs. Before Giancarlo began spearheading the so-called Digital Dollar Project, the former CFTC chairman was among those addressing Mnuchin on the crypto topic.An e-mail exchange from July 2018 shows that Giancarlo, via his executive assistant, was adamant about setting up time for an in-person meeting with the Treasury secretary.When CNBC asked about the White House meeting, Giancarlo said he could not recall that specific request, but added that throughout 2018, he ""routinely apprised Secretary Mnuchin of ongoing operation and supervision of the bitcoin futures market launched under CFTC oversight in December 2017.""   Giancarlo also told CNBC that it was ""quite likely"" that he had informed Mnuchin about his growing concerns surrounding the potential adverse impact of a ""Hard Brexit"" on London-based swaps clearing under the joint supervision of the CFTC and the Bank of England. Mnuchin's office expressed interest in some other countries' crypto plans as well, according to the new documents.In Sept. 2019, Mnuchin's team seemed particularly interested in Venezuela's announcement that it would use cryptocurrencies as a way to facilitate free national and international payments. The move could have helped the Venezuelan government circumvent U.S. sanctions, which had largely isolated the state from the global economy.Monica Crowley, then the Treasury's assistant secretary for public affairs, sent off a Bloomberg News headline via email to Mnuchin that read, ""Maduro says Venezuela to activate crypto payment method 'soon,' "" to which the Treasury chief replied, ""Let's discuss."" In his final months at Treasury, Mnuchin apparently argued with the blockchain lobby over his plan to impose new rules on user-hosted cryptocurrency wallets.Part of the problem had to do with concerns over privacy and the difficulty of fully meeting compliance requirements. The proposal would have required crypto exchanges to collect counterparty information, including names and addresses, from those looking to send or receive crypto from a self-hosted wallet.The timing was also rushed.The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, proposed the rule a week before Christmas 2020, after Joe Biden had been elected as the next president but before he took office. Although this deadline was extended multiple times, FinCEN initially offered only a 15-day public comment window on the proposal. Typically, comment periods run 30 to 90 days.The Blockchain Association, which had reached out to Mnuchin a month before the proposal was formally put forth, enlisted the help of an attorney. Kirkland & Ellis lawyer Paul Clement wrote a letter to Mnuchin on the association's behalf, saying that ""the notion that stakeholders could meaningfully engage with a rule that touches on more than 24 separate subjects in such a highly truncated period would be doubtful even in the ordinary course.""Clement warned, ""Thus, what purports to be just a reporting requirement may well operate as a de facto ban,"" according to the documents.The Blockchain Association wasn't alone in urging Mnuchin to re-think the new crypto rule. Correspondence shows that others suggested he lose the counterparty disclosure requirement. Ultimately, nothing came of the proposal."
2022-01-12,"A class action lawsuit accuses Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather of artificially inflating the price of the cryptocurrency EthereumMax.The celebrities made ""false or misleading statements"" about the little-known token in social media posts, the lawsuit claims.EthereumMax has lost around 97% of its value since early June, leading some investors to label it as a ""pump and dump"" scheme. Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather are being sued over allegations they misled investors when promoting a little-known cryptocurrency called EthereumMax to their millions of social media followers.A class action lawsuit filed last Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California accuses EthereumMax and its celebrity promoters of working together to artificially inflate the price of the token by making ""false or misleading statements"" in social media posts.Kardashian caused a stir last year when she made an Instagram post promoting the EthereumMax token. ""Are you guys into crypto????"" Kardashian wrote. ""This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends just told me about the Ethereum Max token!""Kardashian included the hashtag #ad in the message, suggesting she was paid to promote it. It's not clear how much Kardashian was paid by EthereumMax, though estimates have placed her fee per sponsored Instagram post in the $500,000 to $1 million range.Meanwhile, Mayweather endorsed the token in his boxing match with YouTube star Logan Paul. EthereumMax was accepted as payment for tickets to the event, a move the lawsuit claims boosted trading volumes sharply.Mayweather also promoted EthereumMax at a major bitcoin conference in Miami, and was subsequently booed off stage. Mayweather doesn't appear to have disclosed payment for his promotion of the token, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit claims that plaintiff Ryan Huegerich, a New York resident, and other investors who purchased EthereumMax tokens between May 14, 2021, and June 17, 2021, suffered losses as a result of the celebrities' conduct.EthereumMax has lost around 97% of its value since early June, leading some investors to label it as a ""pump and dump"" scheme where scammers attempt to boost the price of an asset through false or misleading statements. The accusation features in Huegerich's lawsuit, which accuses Kardashian and Mayweather of ""shilling"" EthereumMax.EthereumMax ""has no connection"" to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, the lawsuit said, adding its branding appears to be an effort to mislead investors into believing the token is part of the Ethereum network.Representatives for Kardashian and Mayweather were not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

""We dispute the allegations and look forward to the truth coming out.""It's not the first time celebrities have been in hot water for cryptocurrency endorsements — much to the ire of regulators.In 2018, Mayweather was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with pumping an initial coin offering, a controversial crypto crowdfunding method. Mayweather paid over $600,000 in a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the regulator's findings.In September 2021, Charles Randell, chair of the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, singled out Kardashian's Instagram ad for EthereumMax in a speech warning about crypto scams. Randell said that while he couldn't say if EthereumMax specifically was a scam, ""social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation."""
2022-01-12,"Real estate in virtual worlds — sometimes called the metaverse — is going for millions of dollars in some cases.The most expensive spots are near where lots of users congregate — for instance, someone recently paid $450,000 to be Snoop Dogg's neighbor in a virtual world called the Sandbox.But even proponents are warning would-be investors that this is risky business. It's no secret the real estate market is skyrocketing, but the Covid pandemic is creating another little-known land rush. Indeed, some investors are paying millions for plots of land — not in New York or Beverly Hills. In fact, the plots do not physically exist here on Earth.Rather, the land is located online, in a set of virtual worlds that tech insiders have dubbed the metaverse. Prices for plots have soared as much as 500% in the last few months ever since Facebook announced it was going all-in on virtual reality, even changing its corporate name to Meta Platforms.""The metaverse is the next iteration of social media,"" said Andrew Kiguel, CEO of Toronto-based Tokens.com, which invests in metaverse real estate and non fungible token-related digital assets.  ""You can go to a carnival, you can go to a music concert, you can go to a museum,"" Kiguel said. In these virtual worlds, real people interact as cartoon-like characters called avatars, similar to a real-time multiplayer video game. Today, people can access these worlds through a normal computer screen, but Meta and other companies have a long-term vision of building 360-degree immersive worlds, which people will access through virtual reality goggles like Meta's Oculus.A recent report by crypto asset manager Grayscale estimates the digital world may grow into a $1 trillion business in the near future. Here, major artists, including Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and DJ Marshmello, are performing as their own avatars. Even Paris Hilton DJ'ed a New Year's Eve party on her own virtual island.Kiguel's company recently dropped nearly $2.5 million on a patch of land in Decentraland — one of several popular metaverse worlds. ""Prices have gone up 400% to 500% in the last few months,"" Kiguel said.Another hot metaverse world is the Sandbox, where Janine Yorio's virtual real estate development company, Republic Realm, spent a record $4.3 million on a parcel of virtual land.  Yorio tells CNBC her company sold 100 virtual private islands last year for $15,000 each. ""Today, they're selling for about $300,000 each, which is coincidentally the same as the average home price in America,"" she said. ""The digital world, to some, is as important as the real world,"" Miami-based real estate broker Oren Alexander tells CNBC. ""It's not about what you and I believe in, but it's about what the future does.""Just like property in the real world, Kiguel says the metaverse is about three things: location, location, location.""There are areas when you first go into the metaverse where people congregate — those areas would certainly be a lot more valuable than the areas that don't have any events going on,"" Kiguel said.To be sure, those heavily trafficked areas are reeling in big spenders.""Think about the board game Monopoly. We just bought Boardwalk and the surrounding area,"" Kiguel said. ""Areas where people congregate are far more valuable for advertisers and retailers to find ways to get in there to access that demographic.""For example, Snoop Dogg is building a virtual mansion on a plot of land in Sandbox, and someone recently paid $450,000 to be his neighbor. ""I think it absolutely matters who your neighbor is,"" said Yorio. ""That's kind of true of almost anything, right? It's like a club and you want to be around people that share similar interests.""Buying virtual land is pretty simple — either directly from the platform or through a developer. Investors build on their land and make it interactive. ""You can decorate it, you can change it, you can renovate,"" Yorio says. ""It's code.""But Yorio cautions that investing in digital real estate is risky business.""[It's] highly, highly risky. You should only invest capital that you're prepared to lose,"" Yorio tells CNBC. ""It's highly speculative. It's also blockchain-based. And as we all know, crypto is highly volatile. But it can also be massively rewarding.""Mark Stapp, professor and director for real estate theory and practice at Arizona State University, agrees. ""I would not put money into this that I didn't care about losing. I certainly wouldn't,"" Stapp says. ""If it continues the way it's going, it is most likely going to be a bubble. You're buying something that isn't tied to reality."""

Jack Dorsey's payments company Block (formerly Square) is going to start mining for bitcoin.In a string of tweets, Block's general manager for hardware, Thomas Templeton, laid out the company's plans for next steps.Templeton says the goal is to make bitcoin mining — the process of creating new bitcoins by solving increasingly complex computational problems — more distributed and efficient in every way, ""from buying, to set up, to maintenance, to mining.""The idea of making the mining process more accessible has to do with more than just creating new bitcoin, according to Templeton. Instead, he says the company sees it as a long-term need for a future that is fully decentralized and permissionless.""Mining needs to be more distributed,"" Dorsey wrote in a tweet in October, when he first floated the idea. ""The more decentralized this is, the more resilient the bitcoin network becomes."" Toward that end, the company is solving one major barrier to entry: Mining rigs are hard to find, expensive, and delivery can be unpredictable. Block says it is open to making a new ASIC, which is the specialized gear use to mine for bitcoin.The project is being incubated within Block's hardware team, which is beginning to build out a core engineering team of system, ASIC, and software designers led by Afshin Rezayee. In terms of the hardware, Dorsey previously tweeted that the company was considering a ""bitcoin mining system based on custom silicon."" Dorsey went on to share his thoughts on the need for more of a focus on vertical integration, as well as on silicon design, which he says is too concentrated among a few companies.Templeton writes that Block also looking to improve reliability and the user experience of mining.""Common issues we've heard with current systems are around heat dissipation and dust. They also become non-functional almost every day, which requires a time-consuming reboot. We want to build something that just works,"" Templeton tweeted. ""They're also very noisy, which makes them too loud for home use.""Democratizing access to bitcoin mining is a big part of the mission statement of this project.""Mining isn't accessible to everyone,"" wrote Dorsey in October. ""Bitcoin mining should be as easy as plugging a rig into a power source. There isn't enough incentive today for individuals to overcome the complexity of running a miner for themselves."" The announcement from Block comes just a few months after the U.S. eclipsed China for the first time ever as the world's top destination for bitcoin miners. The U.S. is also flush with renewable power sources.Washington State is a mecca for hydropowered mining farms. New York produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains, and it counts its nuclear power plants toward its 100% carbon-free electricity goal. Meanwhile, Texas' share of renewables is growing over time, with 20% of its power coming from wind as of 2019. The Texas grid also continues to rapidly add more wind and solar power.Texas also has a deregulated power grid with real-time spot pricing that lets customers choose between power providers, and crucially, its political leaders are pro-crypto. Those are dream conditions for miners who want a kind welcome and cheap energy sources.""If you're looking to relocate hundreds of millions of dollars of miners out of China, you want to make sure you have geographic, political, and jurisdictional stability. You also want to make sure there are private property rights protections for the assets that you are relocating,"" said Darin Feinstein, co-founder of cryptocurrency mining operator Core Scientific. "

Gemini, the $7.1 billion crypto exchange, is getting into wealth management with the acquisition of a digital asset platform for financial advisors, CNBC has learned exclusively.The company has agreed to purchase BITRIA, a five-year-old San Francisco-based start-up whose tools help advisors manage holdings of bitcoin and other tokens, according to Gemini's global head of business development Dave Abner.The move creates one of the industry's first full-service digital asset custodians for advisors, according to Abner, who declined to disclose how much Gemini paid in the deal. Gemini intends to combine its crypto custody and exchange capabilities with BITRIA's portfolio management programs, allowing advisors to do things like tax-loss harvesting, he said.""Advisors manage the biggest pool of money in the country right now, and they're hearing from their clients that want access to crypto,"" Abner said this week in a phone interview. ""This creates a one-stop, end-to-end experience for advisors to manage all of their clients' digital assets within their traditional portfolio management systems.""Crypto insiders have forecast a boom in mergers this year as a cohort of newly flush digital asset giants like Gemini and Coinbase look to acquire capabilities and expand offerings. Just yesterday, Coinbase announced it was buying Chicago-based FairX so that it could offer derivatives to retail and institutional customers.Though crypto started more than a decade ago as a retail investor-led phenomenon, the rise of bitcoin, ethereum and other coins in the past two years has enticed bigger investors into the space. That's created the need for ways to provide wealthy investors access to crypto through familiar wealth management vehicles like separately managed accounts.""Nobody else in the crypto space is looking at servicing the wealth management community the way that Gemini is,"" Abner said. ""We're already the largest service provider to crypto ETFs globally. Now we are moving into the wealth space, and we're going to be the only pure-play full service provider of crypto assets"" to advisors. BITRIA, which changed its name from Blockchange in November, is one of a small handful of crypto companies that have sprung up to service financial advisors. Competitors include Onramp Invest and Eaglebrook Advisors. The broader financial advisor industry's assets have surged along with booming equities markets, topping $110 trillion during the pandemic.Gemini, founded in 2014 by Winklevoss twins Tyler and Cameron, was valued at $7.1 billion in a November funding round. Ballooning valuations in the industry have left companies flush with cash and with mandates to ramp up growth.The acquisition followed a partnership between the two firms announced in 2020. BITRIA's employees, including co-founder and CEO Daniel Eyre, are joining Gemini, the companies said.""The future of wealth management lies in digital assets and blockchain technology and the integration of BITRIA's technology with Gemini provides a bridge to that future,"" Eyre said in a statement."
2022-01-13,"Block founder and CEO Jack Dorsey just confirmed that the company, formerly known as Square, plans to move forward with plans to build a bitcoin mining system.""We're officially building an open bitcoin mining system,"" Dorsey tweeted on Thursday. The company first announced that it was considering the project in October.The project's goal is to make mining bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, ""more distributed and efficient,"" tweeted Thomas Templeton, the company's general manager for hardware.Bitcoin operates on a proof of work (PoW) model, where miners must compete to solve complex puzzles in order to validate transactions. The process isn't easy: It requires a lot of energy and computer power, which isn't cheap. The computers themselves, along with other equipment, can also be very expensive.Templeton mentioned that there are a number of ""customer pain points"" and ""technical challenges"" in the mining community that Block hopes to address, including mining rig availability, high price, reliability and power consumption.""For most people, mining rigs are hard to find. Once you've managed to track them down, they're expensive and delivery can be unpredictable,"" Templeton tweeted. ""How can we make it so that anyone, anywhere, can easily purchase a mining rig?"" he said. ""We want to build something that just works. What can we simplify to make this a reality?""Templeton said that Block is developing a hardware team of engineers and software designers to assess these questions. ""Developing products is never a solo journey, and evaluating existing tech is always part of our practice,"" he said.This announcement isn't surprising. After all, it's no secret that Dorsey loves and owns bitcoin.Before floating the idea of Block (then Square) building a mining system in October, Dorsey also said in August that he's ""trying"" to mine bitcoin himself.""Mining isn't accessible to everyone,"" Dorsey tweeted in October.

2022-01-14,"Billionaire Mark Cuban is mostly investing in cryptocurrency nowadays.""The investments I'm making now are not in traditional businesses,"" Cuban said on a recent episode of ""The Problem With Jon Stewart"" podcast. In fact, ""80% of the investments that I make that are not on 'Shark Tank' are in or around cryptocurrencies.""One type of organization in particular has captured Cuban's attention: decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. ""That is really where I look to invest,"" he said.In theory, a DAO is a blockchain-based collective that isn't governed by one person or entity. Any changes to the DAO's rules or governance must be voted on by its members. To gain these voting rights, as well as other powers within the organization, investors typically hold the DAO's governance tokens.""All these new businesses are being formulated now that take this new approach,"" Cuban, an investor on ABC's ""Shark Tank"" and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said. He added that there will be ""game-changing businesses"" that come from these types of organizations.In particular, he predicts that industries like banking and insurance are ""going to change,"" thanks to these new technologies.Cuban is also bullish on smart contracts, which are collections of code that carry out a set of instructions on the blockchain and power decentralized applications. Smart contracts are instrumental in forming DAOs, as well as in powering other crypto projects, such as decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs.But DAOs and their governance tokens can be risky bets for investors. Financial experts warn to only invest what you can afford to lose, since they deem cryptocurrency to be a volatile and speculative investment.Nonetheless, this positive outlook isn't particularly surprising from Cuban, who has consistently been outspoken about his belief in smart contracts. Cuban is an avid investor in the crypto space, with a cryptocurrency portfolio of various digital coins, NFTs and investments in many blockchain companies.But even Cuban is realistic about the burgeoning industry. He called the cryptocurrency space casino-like because it's still so new. ""It's like the early days of the internet,"" he told Stewart. ""The exact same thing is happening now. It's 1995 for cryptocurrencies.""""It's not to say there aren't a lot of problems,"" Cuban continued. Cryptocurrency ""is hard to understand and it's a hassle.

2022-01-14,"Company stocks and real estate will be among the many things that get turned into non-fungible tokens in the future, according to venture capitalist Bill Tai. The tech investor said that ""it's going to happen"" and it's ""not even a question.""NFTs are ""one-of-a-kind"" assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold over the internet. They're designed to show that someone has ownership of a unique virtual item, such as online pictures and videos, or even sports trading cards. Company stocks and real estate will be among the many things that get turned into non-fungible tokens in the future, according to venture capitalist Bill Tai.The tech investor told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal on Wednesday that ""it's going to happen"" and it's ""not even a question.""Instead, it is simply a matter of when it will happen at scale, Tai said at the Crypto Finance Conference in St. Moritz, Switzerland.NFTs are ""one-of-a-kind"" assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold over the internet. They're designed to show that someone has ownership of a unique virtual item, such as online pictures and videos or even sports trading cards. It's currently unclear why anyone would want to own an NFT of a stock or what they would be able to do with it.Over the last year, the number of items being turned into NFTs has grown rapidly. Everything from the source code of the world wide web to Jack Dorsey's first tweet has been sold as NFTs.But some people are confused as to why these non-tangible assets are being sold for so much money. In March, South Carolina-based graphic designer Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, sold an NFT for a record $69 million at a Christie's auction. In June, an NFT of the web’s source code sold for $5.4 million.Data from market tracker DappRadar published Tuesday shows total NFT sales hit $25 billion in 2021 as the speculative crypto-asset boomed in popularity. Some of the world's best-known companies including Coca-Cola and Gucci have also sold NFTs. While some are concerned there's an NFT bubble, Tai, who has invested in start-ups like Zoom and Scribd, said he expects more and more things to be turned into NFTs as the internet moves from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.""Web 1.0 was read-only,"" he said. ""Web 2.0 is read-write. Web 3.0 is the instantiation of a wrapper around everything that's coming in and out of that screen so that it can move around. So it's an internet of assets.""""You can put land titles on there, real estate, art, drawings, anything,"" he added, explaining that everything can have an address that allows people to find it through a marketplace. ""It's the most efficient way over time to assign ownership of really any asset.""Like many other NFT advocates, Tai is also interested in cryptocurrencies. He described the latest crypto collapse that saw bitcoin's value briefly fall to less than $40,000 on Monday as ""yet another wobble"" but he's optimistic it will bounce back.""I don't know when it's going to go back up, but it's going to go back up,"" he said, adding that cryptocurrencies are at the crux of institutional acceptance.Elsewhere, Seba Bank CEO told CNBC that bitcoin's price could nearly double to $75,000 this year as more institutional investors start to embrace it.""Our internal valuation models indicate a price right now between $50,000 and $75,000,"" said the boss of the regulated Swiss bank which has a focus on cryptocurrencies. ""I'm quite confident we are going to see that level. The question is always timing."""
2022-01-14,"The Northwest Arkansas Council, a nonprofit organization, is offering remote tech professionals and entrepreneurs $10,000 in bitcoin to move to the region.Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is currently trading at around $42,893, according to Coin Metrics.Why bitcoin? ""Northwest Arkansas is experiencing explosive growth in the tech sector, specifically within blockchain-enabled technologies, and this incentive embraces the growing trend of cryptocurrency as a payment option by employers,"" its website reads.The incentive is part of the NWA Council's ""Life Works Here"" campaign, which is funded by the Walton Family Foundation. When it first launched in 2020, the NWA Council initially offered $10,000 cash as an incentive program. It recently decided to add the option for remote workers to accept the amount in bitcoin instead, although they can still choose cash if they prefer.""While we've had overwhelming interest in the initial incentive program, we're continuing to seek out unique and in-demand talent in the STEAM and blockchain professions,"" the website says.In order to be eligible, applicants must relocate to Northwest Arkansas, which includes Washington and Benton counties, within six months of acceptance to the program and sign a one-year lease or buy a home.Applicants also must be at least 24 years old, have at least two years of work experience, currently live outside of the state of Arkansas and be a U.S. citizen or have the credentials required to work legally in the U.S., according to the program's website.In addition to the money, the NWA Council is also offering to gift remote workers a bicycle, highlighting the region's mountain biking trails, or a free membership to local theaters and museums.So far, over 35,000 people have applied from more than 115 countries and 50 states, the NWA Council says.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: This 22-year-old earns $200,000 per year in Tulsa, Oklahoma—and saves around $11,000 a month"
2022-01-15,"The HIFO (short for highest in, first out) accounting method can significantly slash an investor's tax obligation.When you sell your crypto, you can pick and choose the specific unit you are selling. That means a crypto holder can pick out the most expensive bitcoin they bought and use that number to determine their tax obligation. A higher cost basis translates to less tax on your sale, because with capital gains, the equation is your sales price minus the cost basis. Bitcoin is down around 36% from its all-time high in November, but the dip has a good side, thanks to a quirk in the tax code that helps crypto holders shield their winnings from the IRS.The IRS treats cryptocurrencies like property, meaning that anytime you spend, exchange, or sell your tokens, you're logging a taxable event. There's always a difference between how much you paid for your crypto, which is the cost basis, and the market value at the time you spend it. That difference can trigger capital gains taxes.But a little-known accounting method known as HIFO — short for highest in, first out — can significantly slash an investor's tax obligation.When you sell your crypto, you can pick and choose the specific unit you are selling. That means a crypto holder can pick out the most expensive bitcoin they bought and use that number to determine their tax obligation. A higher cost basis translates to less tax on your sale.But the onus is on the user to keep track, so thorough bookkeeping is essential. Without detailed records of a taxpayer's transaction and cost basis, calculations to the IRS can't be substantiated.""People rarely use it because it requires keeping good records or using crypto software,"" explained Shehan Chandrasekera, a CPA and head of tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io. ""But the thing is, lots of folks now use that kind of software, which makes this kind of accounting super easy. They just don't know it exists.""The trick to HIFO accounting is keeping granular details about every crypto transaction you made for each coin you own, including when you purchased it and for how much, as well as when you sold it and the market value at that time.But if you don't have all transaction records logged, or you're not using the right kind of software, the accounting method defaults to something called FIFO, or first in, first out.""It's not ideal,"" Chandrasekera explains.Under FIFO accounting rules, when you sell your tokens, you're selling the earliest purchased coin. If you bought your crypto before its big price run-up in 2021, your low cost basis can mean a bigger capital gains tax bill. Pairing HIFO accounting with the wash sale rule has the potential to save taxpayers even more money, experts tell CNBC.Because the IRS classifies digital currencies like bitcoin as property, losses on crypto holdings are treated differently than losses on stocks and mutual funds, according to Onramp Invest CEO Tyrone Ross. In particular, wash sale rules don't apply, meaning that you can sell your bitcoin and buy it right back, whereas with a stock, you would have to wait 30 days to buy it back.This nuance in the tax code paves the way for aggressive tax-loss harvesting, where investors sell at a loss and buy back bitcoin at a lower price. Those losses can lower your tax bill or be used to offset future gains.For instance, say a taxpayer purchases one bitcoin for $10,000 and sells it for $50,000. This individual would face $40,000 of taxable capital gains. But if this same taxpayer had previously harvested $40,000 worth of losses on earlier crypto transactions, they'd be able to offset the tax they owe.""You want to look as poor as possible,"" explained Chandrasekera.Chandrasekera says he sees people doing this on a weekly to quarterly basis, depending on their sophistication.Quickly buying back the cryptos is another key part of the equation. If timed correctly, buying the dip enables investors to catch the ride back up, if the price of the digital coin rebounds."
2022-01-15,"New job creation will be taking place inside the metaverse in 2022, from developers working on gaming and NFT transactions for luxury brands and social media platforms, to gamers monetizing their skills.The venture capital community will continue to make investments that bridge the world of gaming and the metaverse economy.A new global infrastructure based on massive computing power needs should support leading chipmakers like Nvidia and Intel. If 2021's word of the year was ""NFT,"" Avery Akkineni says 2022's will be ""Web 3.0.""As president of VaynerNFT, Akkineni spends much of her time consulting with brands looking to get a piece of the metaverse action. The notion of a ""corporate metaverse strategy"" is new — VaynerNFT itself was founded less than 6 months ago — but it's building momentum. The company's first client was Budweiser, and Akkineni foresees plenty of other major brands following its lead. In fact, the baseline, widely agreed-upon prediction for 2022: more major brands will get involved in Web3 projects. ""2022 will be the year major brands embrace NFTs in a big way,"" says Lin Dai, CEO of music NFT platform OneOf. The Quincy Jones-backed start-up is behind the near $1 million auction for an NFT of a never-before-heard Whitney Houston song, and has collaborated with The Recording Academy for an exclusive Grammy Awards partnership. But this year, digital assets built on the blockchain will likely continue to expand well beyond the music and art industries.Luxury fashion brand Balenciaga has already teamed up with Fortnite to deliver to users designer ""skins"" to wear inside the game. Gucci has done the same with Roblox, and Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren have launched their own Roblox experiences. Brian Trunzo, metaverse Lead at Polygon Studios, which focuses on gaming, NFTs and Web3 efforts linked to the polygon digital currency and ethereum blockchain network, says nimble, smart streetwear brands are already in the space as well. ""The players have finally taken the field, and the game is about to truly start,"" Trunzo said. Akkineni says that the focus for brands, at least at this point, isn't to win but simply to get involved. So far, brand engagement with blockchain projects has been about building community and staying relevant. The Nike and Adidas NFT drops, for example, generated more buzz than cash, but they lent legitimacy to a still-nascent space. More direct commercialization strategies could be coming. Cathy Hackl, CEO and chief metaverse officer for the Futures Intelligence Group, a metaverse consultant, points out that for luxury brands in particular, the metaverse could be an access point for a secondary market. ""When someone sells their Birkin bag on The RealReal, Hermes does not see a cut of that. But through blockchain and NFTs, they are eventually going to get a cut of the secondary market,"" Hackl said.  As more companies seek a foothold in the digital universe, hiring opportunities for candidates comfortable with Web3 will grow. Hackl says her title may become more common.""Even if you look at job boards, you're increasingly seeing demand for Solidity developers and Discord managers,"" Akkineni said.Solidity is a computer language used in conjunction with the ethereum blockchain to build and deploy smart contracts. Discord is a social media platform favored by many gamers and the crypto community.Big brands will naturally help drive Web3 job creation, but a new kind of employment might take center stage. The play-to-earn gaming model gained popularity in the Philippines with Axie Infinity four years ago, and now the game has over 1.8 million daily active users, some reporting an income of about $10 a day, and up to $1,000-$2,000 a month from solely playing the game.""It's kind of like a universal basic income experiment mixed with an e-sport,"" says Vance Spencer, a DeFi venture capitalist and co-founder of Framework Ventures.   There has been controversy within the gaming world about virtual monetization, but the math that supports more investments linking the metaverse to gaming is simple, according to Spencer.Gaming is the biggest segment of the entertainment industry, with nearly 3 billion regular participants. Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity's developer, was the first to monetize NFTs in a gaming environment, but it won't be the last. Investors are recognizing the potential in crypto-gaming crossover. In October, Sky Mavis raised $152 million from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Cuban. Developers looking to do the same are likely to be successful, although for Spencer, the most upside is for developers making AAA-quality games that can be played on PC, like Take-Two Interactive's Grand Theft Auto and EA's FIFA. Roblox, though, and even Minecraft, have found substantial success despite not being AAA games.GameStop is making the same bet, announcing plans to launch its own NFT marketplace. It's likely that GME will need to make a slew of Web3 hires to execute the plan. Brands are likely to tap into the gaming revenue streams, too.""There's a direct commercialization opportunity in the gaming space. … People are very used to paying $20, $50, $100 per skin,"" Akkineni said.And gamers are indeed willing to shell out for their virtual avatars: the digital version of Gucci's Dionysus bag sold on Roblox for more than the bag's IRL retail price.  The bigger the corporate plans for the digital world, the more computing power we'll need. As more brands leverage NFTs to build their communities in virtual worlds and as more consumers follow them in, technological and physical infrastructure moves into the foreground of the metaverse landscape. At the end of 2021, Intel estimated that Web3 metaverse projects will eventually demand at least 1000x the computing power we have now.   Another prediction for 2022: advancements in infrastructure. ""The amount of concurrent users online within a single server or 'node' in all virtual worlds will continue to increase,"" Trunzo said, and with that, advancements in the physical components to make the kind of consistent traffic possible and reliable. It's a natural and necessary part of tech's maturation, and it keeps the semiconductor mainstays like Intel and Nvidia in a solid position, whatever becomes of the metaverse.  The world of NFTs and blockchain-based digital assets is, for now, a hot one. But winter could be coming. Akinneni said, as demand will likely cool off and by the end of 2022, we may find fewer projects and fewer drops.""This probably won't be the year where we have a 90% drawdown in teams that are working on projects, but this will be the start of the end of the beginning,"" Spencer said.Not every blockchain project has the team to push it into the mainstream, and Spencer expects a maturation shift, and healthy consolidation. This consolidation could emerge in legacy brand M&A strategies. Akkineni points to Nike's acquisition of RTFKT as a pivotal moment in blockchain legitimacy beyond the crypto-native crowd. For big Fortune 50 or Fortune 500 brands, it's not too early to consider making similar deals, Hackl said.The biggest hurdles for the digital worlds of 2022 are scalability, in the form of computing power and interoperability between discrete metaverses, and security. Both of which, Akkineni points out, are typical for emerging technologies.  "
2022-01-15,"CNBC sports business reporter Jabari Young experienced the Jan. 10 NBA courtside game between the Celtics and Pacers on the Oculus 2 headset.Here's what Young thinks about watching basketball in virtual reality, and what you should know about it. Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka popped up from the team bench, and before I knew it, he was blocking my view. Indiana Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was close enough for me to see his Cole Haan shoes, and I saw a Lance Stephenson 3-pointer from an angle I'd never seen before.That's just some of my recent experience watching an NBA game while wearing a virtual reality headset.The National Basketball Association is offering virtual courtside seats on Meta's $299 Oculus Quest 2 devices. The headsets were one of the most popular Christmas gifts in 2021, showing that people seem to be more willing than ever to give virtual reality a try. And businesses are trying to keep your eyeballs on their content by creating VR versions of their apps and games. The NBA experience is free and available on Meta's Horizon Venues platform, which is a free software download for the Oculus headset. People appear as digital avatars, sort of like cartoon versions of their real selves, and watch an NBA game from a courtside perspective. It's not Jack Nicholson's Los Angeles Lakers seat at Crypto.com Arena or Spike Lee's seat at Madison Square Garden, but it almost replicates the real thing.From a business perspective, the deal could give the NBA a new set of media rights, which is important as regional sports networks struggle.Meanwhile, Meta — the company formerly known as Facebook — is using the partnership with sports providers including the NBA, WWE and Premier League to give people new reasons to try virtual reality.Mark Zuckerberg's company is making a $10 billion investment in the metaverse, a virtual world he believes will become the standard for social networking, gaming and even work.Meta sent CNBC the Oculus 2 headset last month. I experienced the Jan. 10 NBA courtside game between the Celtics and Pacers. Here's what you need to know. First, you should know you're prohibited from watching if you live in the market where an NBA game is being broadcast on TV. The NBA uses RSN feeds from its League Pass product, and local markets are subject to the same annoying restrictions you run into elsewhere.Once you get in the game, you'll instantly notice other avatars engaging in live discussions. The closeness of the action grabs your attention, too. It's here that you get immersed in the experience, as it actually feels a lot like being in a courtside seat, right down to the engagement with nearby fans.There are two levels in the digital room where you can watch the game. The first level is usually where the crowd watches while chatting, and on this night, I counted about 15 people in the room during the first quarter.The balcony level is quieter for a more private setting, and the view is fine.Don't be afraid to spark up a conversation with an avatar whose microphone is on, especially if you need help navigating the room, which looks like two levels of a private social club.As the Celtics were up 23-18 in the first quarter, one avatar approached me to ask for assistance on watching. I was confused at first, as my stream was fine, but it became clear the real person behind the avatar had a bad connection or was restricted due to local blackout rules.That prompted him to label the NBA's metaverse experience ""trash."" Moments later, I asked another avatar standing next to me what he thought of the experience.""This is dope,"" responded the avatar named ""TUtley."" ""They need to get this for football.""The scenic views of Boston that appeared during game breaks were pretty impressive, too, and gave me a sense of being in the city where the game is played. ""Yo, man! Are you alright,"" I overheard one avatar asking another.The avatar in question was slumped over and unresponsive. It almost appeared the metaverse figure was having a seizure. The avatar eventually regained his form and started talking, but that glitch was certainly weird.The controllers are your hands in the metaverse, so it can be weird seeing nearby avatars with their hands and arms looking misaligned with their bodies.In the fourth quarter, Stephenson nailed a 3-pointer, and Pacers forward Torrey Craig then converted a layup to cut the Celtics lead to three, 71-68.Witnessing the close sequence was fun, but the relatively poor picture quality eventually became noticeable. TV and video providers have spoiled viewers with high-definition games. So, any slight difference in quality is quickly noticeable.The NBA works with VR production company Media Monks to show the games on the Oculus platform. During the NBA's pandemic ""bubble"" season in Orlando, the firm used Sony's FX6 cameras, which cost roughly $6,000, to shoot VR games. This season, though, games are being shot with Sony FX9 cameras, which cost about $11,000.But Meta frequently experiments with resolution and frame rates of the VR games, which are still technically in ""beta,"" or testing mode. Media Monks places five cameras in NBA arenas but added a sixth for the Celtics-Pacers game to capture a sense of space.One FX9 camera is at the announcer's table, offering the front row view. FX9 cameras are also on each backboard. One is used to capture far shots and another for roving. The cameras switch angles during the game, which can be annoying but necessary when coaches accidentally block the view. Udoka's leg was in my face every time he walked to center court, for example.The featured moderator is former NBA forward Richard Jefferson, but the commentating is dull at times. And the trivia questions don't help.Meta uses former NBA players such as Jefferson to interact with avatars attending the courtside experience. And in some contests, commentators could appear in the room as actual avatars to chat with fans.We'll see how exciting that actually is when it happens. Finally, the selection of games could be better. Celtics-Pacers was fine, but marquee matches would be more appealing and might attract more people, making it an even more social experience.The next two NBA VR games on Oculus are scheduled for Jan. 17 — Covid postponements permitting — featuring the Oklahoma Thunder playing Mark Cuban's Dallas Mavericks. The Jan. 22 VR experience has the Sacramento Kings playing the NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks.Those aren't necessarily must-see games. I missed the overtime session of the Celtics-Pacers because my Oculus headset battery died. But, judging by how many people were on the first level late in the fourth quarter, with more coming in from the Venues lobby, it's fair to say the NBA VR experience was popular that night in the metaverse.Three days after attending the game, I spoke with Rob Shaw, Meta's director of sports leagues and media partnerships, to understand how much the courtside experience has advanced and where it's headed.Shaw was reminded of comments made to CNBC in 2020 when he said the NBA's Oculus concept was ""still at the early stage."" Shaw said the new Oculus Quest 2 and its distribution have made a big difference since then. He noted the device is lighter, has better visuals and is cheaper than its $399 sister device, making it more popular as a gift.""Now, we're in the foundational moments of building and learning the experience,"" said Shaw.I asked whether the NBA experience would stay free, and Shaw didn't rule it out.""I think the business model can be redefined,"" he explained. ""It's not necessarily going to have to be pay-per-view but an economy that can be built around the viewership experience.""He added that if the VR experience can truly evolve to mimic being courtside, ""I can see them wanting to put a price point on a ticket. But that's a decision to be made by the league and media company.""Ultimately, it's up to the NBA whether to charge consumers. The league didn't make an official available to CNBC to discuss it.  While the NBA remains silent on the matter, Meta is looking forward.Shaw envisions immersive VR ads and allowing users to purchase avatar jerseys from a metaverse NBA store. Then, for an extra fee, private live-screening options. There are ideas around a sports bar courtside seat experience and VIP options that include watching games with an NBA legend or celebrity.""I do think sponsorship can be redefined,"" Shaw said. ""The brand activation that is historically limited in-venue suddenly becomes more accessible and customizing to the metaverse.""— CNBC's Steve Kovach contributed to this article."
2022-01-16,"Bitcoin enthusiasts are flocking to Puerto Rico, thanks to tax breaks and an island lifestyle.As the community grows, it's attracting more newcomers from the states as well as curious locals.But not everybody's happy about the influx. In March 2021, crypto entrepreneur and investor David Johnston moved his parents, wife, three daughters, and company with him to Puerto Rico. The 36-year-old, who has been involved in the crypto ecosystem since 2012, says the decision to relocate from Austin was kind of a no-brainer. Beyond the fact that Puerto Rico offers a year-round tropical backdrop with picturesque beaches, the U.S. territory also has crypto-friendly policies, including huge tax breaks to those who spend at least 183 days on the island each year. Residents can keep ahold of their American passports while at the same time not having to pay any taxes on capital gains. It certainly helped seal the deal for Johnston, though for him, the bigger incentive was an overwhelming fear of missing out.""That's where all my friends are. I don't have one friend left in New York, and maybe the pandemic accelerated this, but every single one of them has moved to Puerto Rico,"" he said, noting that many of his California friends have also made the move.  Johnston tells CNBC that after seeing his friends and colleagues decamp, he went to check it out himself in early 2021.""I said, 'Wow, okay, I get it,'"" Johnston recalled of his first impression of the small island territory, whose circumference can be driven in half a day. ""The island has three million people…This is big enough to build a tech center.""Johnston says that Puerto Rico reminds him a lot of Austin in 2012. Back before Tesla, Samsung, and Apple helped turn the Texas capital into one of the country's hottest tech hubs, he says the city felt small. But similar to Puerto Rico today, Austin had a great energy and lots of passionate people moving there, which accelerated over time. So for Johnston, making the move to Puerto Rico feels a whole lot like getting in on the ground floor.""That's where my community is. That's where the people I know and love are going, and they're going there to build something cool. Something that helps everyday people, and that's what I love about open source. That's what I love about blockchain. It's open to everybody,"" he said.  Puerto Rico has fast become the new hot destination for the crypto contingent. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who told the New York Times she bought crypto ""at the right time,"" made the move from San Francisco to Puerto Rico last year, in part to hang with her ""crypto friends"" on the island. Controversial YouTube star and NFT investor Logan Paul set up shop there, as did crypto billionaire Brock Pierce, a child actor (of ""Mighty Ducks"" fame) turned 2020 indie presidential candidate. Meanwhile, Johnston says his whole office building is filling up with start-ups and crypto companies.""Pantera Capital (a crypto fund) is on the fifth floor and then there's a co-working space on the sixth floor. My company, DLTx, we took over the eighth floor, and NFT.com took over the twelfth floor. That's all happened in the last 12 months,"" Johnston tells CNBC.  Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProGoldman Sachs loves Uber, Meta and Amazon — and ranks them in order of preferenceBroadcom bolsters stock with new Apple deal. Here's why the experts like itHere are Cowen's top chip picks for an EV and autonomous-auto future Goldman Sachs loves Uber, Meta and Amazon — and ranks them in order of preferenceBroadcom bolsters stock with new Apple deal. Here's why the experts like itHere are Cowen's top chip picks for an EV and autonomous-auto future Redwood City Ventures, a fund that invests in bitcoin and blockchain companies, has also opened an office in the American territory.For many, the big draw to the island has to do with Act 60, which offers significant tax savings to qualifying residents. In the U.S., investors pay as much as 37% on short-term capital gains and up to 20% on long-term gains, which applies to crypto and other assets held for more than a year. One of the tax breaks under Act 60, known as the Individual Investors Act, drops that tax obligation down to zero if certain qualifications are met. This is especially huge for entrepreneurs and crypto traders.There is also a major tax incentive for business owners to set down roots in Puerto Rico. Mainland companies are subject to a 21% federal corporate tax, plus a state tax, which varies. If a firm exports its services out of Puerto Rico, to the U.S. or really, anywhere else, they pay a 4% corporate tax rate.  CPA Shehan Chandrasekera does caution that any gains realized before arriving to Puerto Rico are still subject to the standard capital gains tax rates on the U.S. mainland. It is just the gains that are earned after becoming a Puerto Rican resident that are excluded from taxes.""That's the part that people are not talking about,"" said Chandrasekera, who heads tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io. But there is a workaround.If an investor has a certain amount of gain, they can go to Puerto Rico, establish residency, sell their stake, and then buy it back as a new position. That way, they avoid muddying the waters with any gains they carry over from the U.S. Puerto Rico's almost too-good-to-be-true tax rules were dreamed up a decade ago to help bring in people and cash at a time when the island was hemorrhaging residents and money. Over the last several years, the territory has suffered a string of bad luck — earthquakes, hurricanes, a multi-year bankruptcy and a global pandemic. Much to the government's relief, investors are now coming in at a record pace. Corporate and tax attorney Giovanni Mendez has been helping to onboard new Puerto Ricans. He tells CNBC that nearly half of his clients right now are either crypto companies or crypto investors, a number that's increased exponentially in the last six years.Mendez, who was raised in a town two hours west of the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan, says that in March 2020, right as the Covid pandemic began to shut down countries around the world, he began speaking with clients about whether to move to Florida (a tax-free state) or Puerto Rico. In the end, many opted for Puerto Rico.""I really wasn't expecting a lot of people to move with everything going on with the pandemic, but to the contrary, a lot of people actually just decided to pull the trigger,"" said Mendez. ""That's certainly coupled with an increase in the value of crypto assets."" Crypto investor George Burke had been thinking about making the move since 2018, but he finally went for it last year.""With the performance of how 2021 was going with bitcoin, and the performance of my company, I knew I needed to make a change, so Puerto Rico became a really good option,"" said Burke.Though Burke wouldn't share an exact dollar figure with CNBC, he did say that his crypto holdings rise to the mid-seven figure range. ""I was in the crowd sale of ethereum…There were only like 6,000 people who were able to do that,"" said Burke, who tells CNBC that he also worked on the first bitcoin debit card back in 2013.As for the move itself, Burke says the process was relatively straightforward.""I got on a plane, I established my residency the same day that I got off the plane just by renting a room at my friend's house, and I started the clock,"" he said. Burke added that he didn't have to apply before arriving. He put in an app for the individual investor's exemption himself, and he paid an attorney $15,000 to help with his business exemption.It was a similar experience for Johnston, who says it took between six and nine months to go through all the perfunctory reviews, though it ""didn't take a huge amount of effort.""""I mean, it's America,"" said Johnston. ""You don't need a visa. You don't have to apply for residency. You don't need a passport. You can just grab a domestic flight and show up in San Juan, grab a driver's license, buy a house, and open an office downtown.""""It was pretty smooth,"" he added.  Before making the move to Puerto Rico, Theodore Agranat tells CNBC that he knew little about Puerto Rico, aside from the fact that it was an American territory. He also recalled seeing images of former President Donald Trump throwing paper towels into a crowd when Hurricane Maria was happening.But after speaking with friends who had made the move and making a scouting trip himself last spring, the 45-year-old felt like Puerto Rico could be the kind of place he had been searching for since his first son was born in 2003: A community of entrepreneur families with kids, comprised of open-minded people who embraced home-schooling and alternative diets — Agranat himself is into raw foods — while at the same time functioning much like a start-up incubator, bringing together business-savvy and creative minds. He found just that in the southeast Puerto Rican city of Humacao.Agranat, who runs an early-stage blockchain investment fund that put money into over 225 projects last year, says the financial incentives were also a huge draw.  Thus far, island life is working out pretty well. Agranat and his wife home-school their three children, and for their 14-year-old, they've customized the curriculum to include crypto-related topics, including NFTs, crypto games, and token swapping.Johnston, who lives in the San Juan suburb of Guaynabo, has adopted a similar approach. He and his wife home-school all three of their children, and crypto has been a part of the lesson plan since day one.""My kids have had crypto wallets since they were born,"" Johnston told CNBC. ""When they did chores for grandma, grandma tried to pay them in cash once, and they said, 'No thanks, grandma. I prefer bitcoin.'""Outside of the suburbs, many gather for Crypto Mondays, a weekly meet-up held at nice hotels and restaurants in the capital, as well as Crypto Curious, which draws people new to the space and covers topics like NFTs, DeFi, and how to open your own crypto wallet. Hundreds of locals have begun to partake in those gatherings, which are now also being offered in Spanish. Burke, who says that his friends and crypto colleagues have been moving to Puerto Rico since the last bitcoin bull run in 2017, tells CNBC that every Thursday, he attends a luncheon with around 30 to 40 other crypto-minded folks who live in either Condado Beach or Old San Juan.  Not everyone is happy about the influx of new residents.For one, locals aren't thrilled about the fact that they don't qualify for the capital gains tax exemption, which is designed for non-Puerto Ricans. Mendez tells CNBC the local rate in Puerto Rico is 15% for long-term capital gains, and the disparity has strained relations between some locals and new residents. An organization that goes by #AbolishAct60 has pushed back on the tax breaks via social media.There is also a question as to whether the tax breaks are achieving what the government set out to do, including, among other things, creating jobs, and sinking more cash into the local economy. Economist and Nobel-prize winner Joseph Stiglitz told a crowd in San Juan in December that he was skeptical of the economic benefits of the tax scheme.The flood of the crypto rich into Puerto Rico has also helped to drive up real estate prices. ""The lack of inventory and the high demand has resulted in prices that we have never seen before in Puerto Rico,"" said Francisco Diaz Fournier of Luxury Collection Real Estate.""I've been tracking the markets for several years, and I was not expecting this…You have properties in Dorado Beach that have been sold for more than $20 million,"" said Fournier, who tells CNBC that there are other properties listed on the market right now for $27 million, $30 million, and $34 million, numbers which have increasingly become par for the course.Rising real estate prices and the growing cost of living have fanned the flames of resentment.But Keiko Yoshino, who was a government employee in Washington, D.C., for seven years before making the move to Puerto Rico, is trying to close this divide by running programs that pull the two groups together to facilitate a knowledge transfer. Which, in theory, is part of what the tax incentive program set out to do in the first place.Yoshino, who runs the Puerto Rico Blockchain Trade Association, plays a major role in planning and running Crypto Curious meet-ups. But a big part of what she's trying to do is dispel stereotypes.""I had been called a crypto colonizer,"" Yoshino said.

Walmart appears to be venturing into the metaverse with plans to create its own cryptocurrency and collection of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.The big-box retailer filed several new trademarks late last month that indicate its intent to make and sell virtual goods, including electronics, home decorations, toys, sporting goods and personal care products. In a separate filing, Walmart said it would offer users a virtual currency, as well as NFTs.According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Walmart filed the applications on Dec. 30. In total, seven separate applications have been submitted.In a statement, Walmart said it is ""continuously exploring how emerging technologies may shape future shopping experiences."" It declined to comment on the specific trademark filings.""We are testing new ideas all the time,"" the company added. ""Some ideas become products or services that make it to customers. And some we test, iterate and learn from."" ""[The filings are] super intense,"" said Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney. ""There's a lot of language in these, which shows that there's a lot of planning going on behind the scenes about how they're going to address cryptocurrency, how they're going to address the metaverse and the virtual world that appears to be coming or that's already here.""Gerben said that ever since Facebook announced it was changing its company name to Meta, signaling its ambitions beyond social media, businesses have been rushing to figure out how they will fit into a virtual world. Nike filed a slew of trademark applications in early November that previewed its plans to sell virtual branded sneakers and apparel. Later that month, it said it was teaming up with Roblox to create an online world called Nikeland. In December, it bought the virtual sneaker company RTFKT (pronounced ""artifact"") for an undisclosed amount.""All of a sudden, everyone is like, 'This is becoming super real and we need to make sure our IP is protected in the space,' "" said Gerben.Gap has also started selling NFTs of its iconic logo sweatshirts. The apparel maker said its NFTs will be priced in tiers ranging from roughly $8.30 to $415, and come with a physical hoodie.Elsewhere, both Under Armour's and Adidas' NFT debuts sold out last month. They're now fetching sky-high prices on the NFT marketplace OpenSea.Gerben said that apparel retailers Urban Outfitters, Ralph Lauren and Abercrombie & Fitch have also filed trademarks in recent weeks detailing their intent to open some sort of virtual store.A report from CB Insights outlined some of the reasons why retailers and brands might want to make such ventures, which can potentially offer new revenue streams.Launching NFTs makes it possible for businesses to ""tokenize"" physical products and services to help reduce online transaction costs, it said. And for luxury brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton, NFTs can serve as a form of authentication for tangible and more expensive goods, CB Insights noted.Gerben said that as more consumers familiarize themselves with the metaverse and items stored on the blockchain, more retailers will want to create their own ecosystem around it.According to Frank Chaparro, director at crypto-information services firm The Block, many retailers are still reeling from being late to e-commerce, so they don't want to miss out on the metaverse.""I think it's a win-win for any company in retail,"" Chaparro said. ""And even if it just turns out to be a fad, there's not a lot of reputation damage in just trying something weird out like giving some customers an NFT in a sweepstake, for instance.""—CNBC's Melissa Repko contributed to this report."

But payment giants have embraced the asset class as it becomes mainstream. Mastercard said Tuesday it inked a deal with Coinbase, the latest in a recent flurry of partnerships between payment and cryptocurrency giants.As part of the agreement, Coinbase customers will be able to use Mastercard credit and debit cards to make purchases on the crypto exchange's upcoming NFT marketplace. Coinbase unveiled late last year plans to launch the platform for minting and buying nonfungible tokens, which have exploded in popularity over the past 12 months.By teaming up with Mastercard, Coinbase executives said they're looking to reduce friction in the NFT buying process. Right now, that often requires customers opening up a crypto wallet, buying digital currencies, then spending those on NFTs in an online marketplace. Mastercard, meanwhile, said it's looking to help expand consumer choice on how to pay for NFTs.""Getting more people involved safely and securely is perhaps the best way to help the NFT market thrive. As it does, Mastercard sees even greater potential for NFTs' underlying tech to go beyond art and collectibles into many more areas,"" Mastercard's Raj Dhamodharan said.Mastercard, one of the world's largest credit card and payment companies, has been on a crypto partnership spree lately. Mastercard announced in October that it's teaming up with Bakkt to let banks and merchants in its network offer crypto-related services. It has also partnered up with Gemini, BitPay and Mintable, among others.Rival Visa has been equally active the crypto space. The company has more than 60 partnerships with companies in the space, including the one with Coinbase. American Express has also said it's exploring using its cards and network with stablecoins. But CEO Stephen Squeri recently told Yahoo Finance that consumers should not expect to see an Amex-crypto-linked card ""anytime soon.""Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were first designed to get around banks and intermediaries. But banks and payment companies have embraced those technologies as cryptocurrencies become mainstream.Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev said in an email that Tuesday's announcement as another example of Mastercard's ""out-of-the-box thinking"" in its approach to crypto. Over the long-term, though, Dolev said blockchain technologies and decentralized finance ""can be a threat to the overall network ecosystem as they are challenging the trusted third party concept.""Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world."
2022-01-18,"After a rough start to the year, the price of bitcoin is about flat in the last seven days. The largest cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $41,671, according to Coin Metrics.Ether, the second-largest, is up about 2% in the same time frame. It's now priced at $3,113.Other top coins had a better week. Cardano, Terra and Dogecoin, for example, jumped over the last seven days, Coin Gecko data shows.Along with price movement, here are six important things that happened in the crypto space last week. In June, Kim Kardashian posted an Instagram Story promoting a cryptocurrency called EthereumMax.""Are you guys into crypto???"" she wrote. ""This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends told me about the Ethereum Max token!"" Kardashian included the hashtag ""#ad,"" which indicates that the post was paid for as promotional content.A class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California was then filed on January 7, accusing Kardashian and other celebrities, like Floyd Mayweather, of ""making false or misleading statements"" about EthereumMax to allegedly increase its price.Ryan Huegerich, a New York resident, filed on behalf of himself and other investors who bought EthereumMax between May 14, 2021 and June 17, 2021. The lawsuit claims Huegerich and others lost money on their investments.Representatives for Kardashian and Mayweather were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. A spokesperson for EthereumMax told CNBC that the lawsuit was ""riddled with misinformation"" and disputed accusations that it was a scam. On Wednesday, Twitter and Block founder Jack Dorsey announced plans to create a ""Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund.""""The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is a non-profit entity that aims to minimize legal headaches that discourage software developers from actively developing Bitcoin and related projects,"" Dorsey wrote in an email.The fund will defend bitcoin developers from lawsuits, ""including finding and retaining defense counsel, developing litigation strategy and paying legal bills,"" with volunteer and part-time lawyers, he wrote. On Thursday, Dorsey confirmed that Block, formerly known as Square, will be ""officially building an open bitcoin mining system,"" he tweeted on Thursday. The company first announced that it was considering the project in October.Bitcoin operates on a proof of work (PoW) model, where miners must compete to solve complex puzzles in order to validate transactions. The process isn't easy: It requires a lot of energy and computer power, which isn't cheap. The computers themselves, along with other equipment, can also be very expensive.

2022-01-18,"U.K. Finance Minister Rishi Sunak plans to bring crypto ads under the same rules that apply to financial promotions.The government says it will introduce legislation to amend existing laws on financial advertising.Ads for crypto flooded London's underground rail network and buses last year amid rising interest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. LONDON — The U.K. government says it will bring cryptocurrency ads under tighter scrutiny and crack down on ""misleading"" claims that may cause investors to lose money.Finance Minister Rishi Sunak plans to bring the ads under the same rules for financial promotions, according to proposals announced Tuesday.The government will introduce legislation to amend existing laws on financial advertising to include crypto. The regime requires firms to be authorized by regulators if they want to promote investment products.The Financial Conduct Authority, a U.K. watchdog tasked with regulating financial firms, will soon start consulting on their proposed financial promotions rules for cryptocurrencies, the government said.""Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest — but it's important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims,"" Sunak said in a statement.The FCA has attracted criticism for not taking action against crypto ads, which flooded London's underground rail network and buses in the past year as interest in bitcoin and other digital currencies has risen. The FCA warns cryptocurrencies are not regulated, and that people investing in them should be prepared to lose all their money. While the regulatory body doesn't have any say over the crypto market specifically, it is getting tougher on companies operating in the sector. Last June, the watchdog hit Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, with a sharp warning saying the firm is not authorized to undertake any regulated activity. While Binance can still sell its services to U.K. residents through its website, it must show a notice explaining its British unit is not regulated.Tuesday's announcement means the FCA will eventually have the power to clamp down on crypto ads.British fintech firm Revolut, which offers trading in crypto and stocks, said it welcomes the news.""Clear guidance in how companies describe their crypto offering will benefit consumers and help improve trust in the sector,"" said Ed Cooper, Revolut's head of crypto. ""Revolut continues to follow the financial promotions rules in its crypto communications.""Britain's Advertising Standards Authority has already taken action against several crypto adverts. The regulator banned seven ads in December from companies including Coinbase and Papa John's for ""irresponsibly taking advantage of consumers' inexperience.""It also blocked a promotion from the crypto exchange Luno, which encouraged people to buy bitcoin without warning of the risks involved in trading cryptocurrencies. The ASA also said it is on ""red alert"" over the issue.While bitcoin had a stellar year in 2021, climbing almost 60%, it and other digital tokens are notoriously volatile. They've been known to rise or fall more than 10% in a single day.Bitcoin is currently down about 40% from an all-time high of nearly $69,000, which it hit in November."
2022-01-19,"For billionaire investor Mark Cuban, there was one defining moment that led him to go all in on cryptocurrency.""I always paid attention to bitcoin, the pricing, the tokens and the [crypto]currencies,"" Cuban told Miami Mayor Francis Suarez at The North American Bitcoin Conference on Monday. ""But what really got me into it was, about a year ago, when I minted my first NFT.""NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, are unique digital assets. Minting an NFT is the process of turning an asset into a token that's represented on the blockchain. It allows NFT owners to both prove that they own the asset and be able to sell it if they want.For Cuban, the opportunity to also earn royalties on secondary sales of his NFTs was huge.""The fact that you could take a digital file — audio, video, picture, whatever — and not only mint it to sell it, but also attach royalties to it, I'm like, 'How can you do that?' Because you can't do that with anything physical,"" the ""Shark Tank"" investor and Dallas Mavericks owner said.After digging a bit deeper, Cuban learned about smart contracts, which are collections of code that carry out a set of instructions on the blockchain. Smart contracts are crucial for NFTs, as well as other crypto projects, such as decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications. ""To me, that's very disruptive,"" he said.""NFTs, while they're hot right now and everybody is talking about them, they're really more just a proof of concept for what you can do with smart contracts and decentralization,"" Cuban told Suarez.Now, Cuban considers himself a crypto ""evangelist,"" he said.

2022-01-19,"Microsoft's planned $68.7 billion acquisition of gaming company Activision Blizzard isn't just a weapon in the tech giant's battle for video game domination.It's also about the metaverse — a buzzy topic at the moment, with brands from Disney to Walmart working to carve out their own niche in the digital space, which promises virtual worlds where people can eventually explore, work and play.Gaming appears to be a particularly large part of Microsoft's metaverse plans. In a press release on Tuesday, the company wrote that buying the ""Call of Duty"" and ""Warcraft"" maker ""will provide building blocks for the metaverse."" Later in that press release, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was quoted as saying that gaming ""will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms.""The move may have been a long time coming. Corporate metaverse interest seemingly exploded after Facebook, now called Meta, changed its name to reflect its bet on a virtually focused future. But Microsoft and Nadella were talking publicly about the idea's potential even before Mark Zuckerberg — and acquiring companies with large gaming communities to give them a leg up.In 2020, Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for ZeniMax Media, the parent company of gaming studio Bethesda. And back in 2014, the tech giant paid $2.5 billion for Mojang, the maker of ""Minecraft.""""As the virtual and physical worlds converge, the metaverse…is emerging as a first-class platform,"" Nadella said in April 2021 during a quarterly earnings call. Microsoft's gaming communities, like ""Minecraft"" and its then-140 million monthly users, could grow into huge commercial marketplaces ""as games evolve into metaverse economies,"" he added.That earnings call came about three months before Zuckerberg first revealed his plans for Facebook and the metaverse, teasing the company's eventual transformation into Meta in October. At Microsoft's Ignite 2021 conference in November, Nadella compared the promise of the metaverse to the way the tech world looked at the nascent internet in the 1990s.""When we talk about the metaverse, we're describing both a new platform and a new application type, similar to how we talked about the web and websites in the early '90s,"" Nadella said in a keynote address at the conference. ""It's no longer just playing a game with friends. You can be in the game with them.""Microsoft does not yet offer the sort of commercial virtual reality headset that would be needed for such an immersive gaming experience. But in June, Nadella described the economic impact that metaverse gaming can already provide: During a conversation with Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft-owned Xbox, Nadella noted that the creators of tens of thousands of ""Minecraft"" game modifications have collectively pulled in more than $350 million, by building new landscapes for other players to explore.""They're creating entire college campuses on 'Minecraft,'"" Nadella said. Microsoft also profits off communities of gamers making in-game purchases, he noted.A market report last year estimated that in-game purchases could top $34 billion in revenue in 2021. The Activision deal could help increase Microsoft's cut: It includes Candy Crush Saga, one of the world's most popular mobile games, which is estimated to pull in more than $1 billion per year from in-app purchases.Of course, Microsoft's metaverse bets aren't limited to gaming. The company launched a Mesh cloud collaboration service for virtual 3D business meetings last year, which Microsoft said ""can serve as a gateway to the metaverse.""And at Microsoft's Build conference in May 2021, Nadella's keynote address delved into what he describes as the ""enterprise metaverse,"" where companies can use Microsoft's business software products to monitor their supply chains in the metaverse, building ""a complete digital twin"" to their real-world infrastructure to better track products from the manufacturing stage to delivery.But Tuesday's agreement to buy Activision shows that Microsoft could view gaming as a way to compete with Meta and any other metaverse giants going forward. Indeed, Nadella has already hinted at the idea of multiple metaverses just under the umbrella of Microsoft's gaming divisions.""If you take 'Halo' as a game, it is a metaverse. 'Minecraft' is a metaverse, and so is 'Flight Sim,'"" Nadella told Bloomberg in November. ""In some sense, they're 2D today, and the question is: 'Can you now take that to a full 3D world?' And we absolutely plan to do so.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Bill Gates says the metaverse will host most of your office meetings within 'two or three years'This 29-year-old book predicted the 'metaverse' — and some of Facebook's plans are eerily similar"
2022-01-19,"The Federal Trade Commission won't back down in the face of intimidation from better-resourced opponents, said Chair Lina Khan in an exclusive interview with CNBC, her first on-camera sit-down.Khan personally has faced pushback from Amazon and Facebook in particular, which petitioned for her recusal from antitrust matters involving their businesses.She said her agency has a duty to consider which cases could have a deterrent effect on other potentially unlawful conduct. The Federal Trade Commission won't back down in the face of intimidation from better-resourced opponents, said Chair Lina Khan in an exclusive interview with CNBC Wednesday, her first on-camera sit-down.Khan said it takes ""courage"" to take on companies with immense power, especially in the face of the FTC's own resource challenges that force it to narrow the scope of its enforcement capabilities.""We're really showing these companies, but also showing the country, that enforcers are not going to back down because of these companies flexing some muscle or kind of trying to intimidate us,"" Khan told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin and Kara Swisher, host of The New York Times' ""Sway"" podcast. ""I think those are the types of lessons that we're trying to learn looking back over the last decade.""Under her leadership, the FTC has taken steps to show its resolve against big business. The agency filed an amended complaint against Facebook on antitrust charges after its earlier one was dismissed, and this time it was allowed to advance. And in the face of a historic merger surge, the FTC has also signaled it will impose tougher sanctions on firms that pursue anticompetitive mergers, like requiring prior approval for future transactions in settlements.Khan personally has faced pushback from Amazon and Facebook in particular, which petitioned for her recusal from antitrust matters involving their businesses. They argued that Khan's past statements and work for the Open Markets Institute and the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust investigating tech firms, indicated she had prejudged their liability.Khan also made a name for herself in academic circles through her 2017 Yale Law Journal article ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,"" which argued for a more expansive interpretation of antitrust laws when applied to digital markets.Just last week, a judge in the FTC's antitrust lawsuit against Facebook affirmed that Khan did not need to recuse herself from the vote to file the amended complaint in the suit, ruling that she was not acting in an adjudicatory role. Khan said it was ""terrific"" to see the judge respond in that way.Khan credited the forceful approach of some of these firms with the standards they had gotten used to from law enforcement historically. She said while they experienced ""lighter touch treatment in the past,"" they're now responding to a pileup of enforcement actions.Khan declined to throw her weight behind any particular bills that would reform antitrust law that are being considered in Congress, but she supported additional resources for the agency and generally welcomed congressional action to minimize certain hurdles enforcers must consider in bringing cases.As it stands, Khan said the agency does have to choose its workload wisely, which often involves trade-offs about what it can pursue. Given those constraints, the question of which enforcement actions could have a deterrent effect becomes an important one, she said.""We have to make very difficult choices about which billion-dollar deals we're going to ensure we're closely investigating, but there are very real trade-offs in terms of what that work is going to come at the expense of,"" she said.""What are instances in which certain types of actions could have a market-wide impact?"" Khan said, giving an example of a question the agency might consider. ""If we are able to obtain a particular settlement or consent decree or get a good outcome in court, what are instances in which that could really change the dynamic in the entire market rather than just, you know, here or there?""Khan said the agency also considers which cases could involve unlawful practices that also have an ""upstream source.""""So certain types of intermediaries or companies that may be facilitating bad practices, going upstream and really try to nip it at the source can also be one way we try to channel our resources in ways that can be more efficient,"" she said.The FTC's lawsuit against Facebook, first filed under Khan's predecessor, is one example of a case the agency has chosen to pursue that could have broader implications for the industry as a whole. In the suit, the FTC claimed that Facebook used its acquisitions of then-nascent competitors Instagram and WhatsApp to amass power and create barriers that impede other firms from entering the market. If the FTC prevails in that case, it could make tech and other industries more skittish about pursuing such acquisitions in the future.Khan said she recognizes the relatively short period of time she has to act on these issues, and aims to do so ""with a fierce sense of urgency.""""I think there's an opportunity here to really change and learn from the mistakes of the past and that's what we're going to try to do,"" she said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.WATCH: How US antitrust law works, and what it means for Big Tech"
2022-01-20,"Russia's central bank on Thursday proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies on Russian territory, citing threats to financial stability, citizens' wellbeing and its monetary policy sovereignty.Russia has argued for years against cryptocurrencies, saying they could be used in money laundering or to finance terrorism. It eventually gave them legal status in 2020 but banned their use as a means of payment.Russia is the world's third-largest player in bitcoin mining, behind the United States and Kazakhstan, though the latter may see a miner exodus over fears of tightening regulation following unrest earlier this month. Russia's central bank on Thursday proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies on Russian territory, citing threats to financial stability, citizens' wellbeing and its monetary policy sovereignty.The move is the latest in a global cryptocurrency crackdown as governments from Asia to the United States worry that privately operated and highly volatile digital currencies could undermine their control of financial and monetary systems.Russia has argued for years against cryptocurrencies, saying they could be used in money laundering or to finance terrorism. It eventually gave them legal status in 2020 but banned their use as a means of payment.In a report published on Thursday, the central bank said speculative demand primarily determined cryptocurrencies' rapid growth and that they carried characteristics of a financial pyramid, warning of potential bubbles in the market, threatening financial stability and citizens.The bank proposed preventing financial institutions from carrying out any operations with cryptocurrencies and said mechanisms should be developed to block transactions aimed at buying or selling cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies.The proposed ban includes crypto exchanges. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance told Reuters it was committed to working with regulators and hoped the report's release would spawn dialogue with the central bank on protecting the interests of Russian crypto users.Restrictions on owning cryptocurrency are not envisaged, said Elizaveta Danilova, head of the central bank's financial stability department.Active cryptocurrency users, Russians have an annual transaction volume of about $5 billion, the bank said.Shadowing China?The central bank said it would work with regulators in countries where crypto exchanges are registered to collect information about the operations of Russian clients. It pointed to steps taken in other countries, such as China, to curb cryptocurrency activity.In September, China intensified its crackdown on cryptocurrencies with a blanket ban on all crypto transactions and mining, hitting bitcoin and other major coins and pressuring crypto and blockchain-related stocks.""For now there are no plans to ban cryptocurrencies similar to the experience of China,"" Danilova said. ""The approach we have proposed will suffice.""Joseph Edwards, head of financial strategy at crypto firm Solrise Group, played down the report's significance, saying no one outside Russia would be losing sleep over it.""Moscow, like Beijing, is always rattling its sabre over 'crypto bans', but Russia has never been a pillar of any facet of the industry in the same way as China has been at times,"" he said.Crypto miningRussia is the world's third-largest player in bitcoin mining, behind the United States and Kazakhstan, though the latter may see a miner exodus over fears of tightening regulation following unrest earlier this month. read moreThe Bank of Russia said crypto mining created problems for energy consumption. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are ""mined"" by powerful computers that compete against others hooked up to a global network to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The process guzzles electricity and is often powered by fossil fuels.""The best solution is to introduce a ban on cryptocurrency mining in Russia,"" the bank said.In August, Russia accounted for 11.2% of the global ""hashrate"" - crypto jargon for the amount of computing power being used by computers connected to the bitcoin network.Moscow-based BitRiver, which operates data centers in Siberia hosting bitcoin miners, said it did not consider a complete crypto ban likely, expecting a balanced position to develop once different ministries have discussed the proposals.The central bank, which is planning to issue its own digital rouble, said crypto assets becoming widespread would limit the sovereignty of monetary policy, with higher interest rates needed to contain inflation."
2022-01-20,"Hedge fund manager David Neuhauser, who has made a name for himself by betting against some of the market's most popular stocks, shared with CNBC his tips for young investors.Speaking on the latest CNBC Pro Talks, Neuhauser suggested that investors should be wary of big-name technology stocks that have seen ""explosive growth"" over the past couple of years amid the coronavirus pandemic.Even so, Neuhauser said it would still be worthwhile for young people to put their money into certain technology stocks because it's invested in the market for a long timescale. This means any major highs and lows would be more likely to even out over time, in theory.The Livermore Partners founder and chief investment officer said he preferred smaller technology companies ""because the potential for those companies to grow is actually there.""Neuhauser said it was ""much more difficult"" to find long-term growth opportunities among the ""mammoth"" companies that are already valued in the trillions of dollars, or even upward of $800 billion. In addition to factoring in company valuations, Neuhauser said it was important for young investors to focus on the effect that rising interest rates could have on stocks.Neuhauser said that he didn't think younger investors were paying enough attention to this as both a headwind for markets and as a potential buying opportunity.Watch the full Pro Talks with David Neuhauser hereHe said that the youngest cohort of investors have ""never seen a bear market, they've never seen a recession, they've never seen a contraction, even in earnings, where a company is still growing, but their earnings have contracted for a while, and those are usually typically the times to be buying those stocks.""In the more-than 25 years that he's been investing, Neuhauser said that he'd often made money after identifying a stock that was out of favor as the economic cycle was ""just about to turn."" Neuhauser shorted (betted against) some major market names last year, including Meta (formerly Facebook) and Tesla. Livermore Partners had also previously shorted the ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund, which is run by investment guru Cathie Wood.Check out: Neuhauser says Ark ETF stocks are a potential 'time bomb'During the latest CNBC Pro Talks, Neuhauser maintained the view that the valuations of some bigger technology companies were more likely to come under pressure going forward.He explained that amid the pandemic these companies had benefitted from increased demand for technology, like software-as-a-service, along with the Federal Reserve's emergency economic support measures.However, Neuhauser expects this demand to slow down. In addition, he said the Fed's plans to raise interest rates this year, and pull back other supportive measures, would make capital expenditure — the cost of maintaining certain internal investments — more expensive for these companies.Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker told CNBC last week he could see as many as four interest rate hikes this year. Many investors believe that the central bank could enact the first rate hike in March. The mounting anticipation of rate hikes, and overall tighter monetary policy, has seen a choppy start to the year for markets, with sell-offs led by technology stocks.

Singapore may be able to draw companies to its stock market through its push for SPACs, said Ringo Choi, EY Asia-Pacific IPO leader.""Companies may be considering to be listed in Hong Kong or say Malaysia or other ASEAN countries, but they will prefer to go for this Singapore SPAC IPO if they have this opportunity,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Thursday.He pointed out that the blank check company was heavily oversubscribed, and the firms may be able to price shares higher in Singapore.That could be a boost for the city state, which has seen average IPO sizes decline and thin liquidity in recent years, Choi said. The authorities want Singapore to be a competitive financial hub with high trading volumes, and were eager to introduce new pathways, he said.Singapore is one of the first markets in Asia to allow such listings. Michael Marquardt, CEO of investor services company IQ-EQ Asia, described Singapore's approach to SPACs as conservative because it only relaxed its regulations last year.""This strategy has provided investors with the confidence they need to trigger new SPAC listings,"" he said in an email. The commitment to create a safe and regulated capital market environment will benefit SPACs in the long run by attracting more inflows, he said.Marquardt also predicted that more SPACs will start to list in Asia's financial hubs.""Given the changes to Hong Kong's listing regime that came into effect at the start of the year, these rule revisions across both jurisdictions will serve to encourage SPAC activity in Asia,"" he said."
2022-01-21,"The cryptocurrency market, along with other riskier assets, is taking a big hit.Bitcoin is down 11% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Hitting its lowest level since August, the largest cryptocurrency by market value dropped below $40,000 on Friday, and is currently trading at around $38,378. Some analysts predict that it could fall even lower.Along with it, ether, the second-largest, is down 14% in the same timeframe. It's currently trading around $2,779.This comes as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffer losses as well. Cryptocurrencies and tech stocks have been falling at the same time this month, showing an increasing correlation between the two.Additionally, there's concern over the potential for more cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S., as well as how the Federal Reserve potentially dialing back its monetary policy would impact the overall market. Globally, other regulators are focusing on cryptocurrency markets as well. On Thursday, for example, Russia's central bank proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies.This dip isn't unusual for bitcoin; cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. As quickly as prices rise, they can tumble back down. Because of this, experts say it's important to consider if you can handle the ups and downs before investing in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.""It's a very volatile asset class,"" Anjali Jariwala, certified financial planner, certified public accountant and founder of Fit Advisors, previously told CNBC Make It. ""You have to be comfortable with the swings and you have to be comfortable also losing your money.""Each investor's risk tolerance will vary. It's important to understand how much you can personally tolerate.For some people, the volatility ""may be OK, that may coincide with your appetite for risk and your own risk tolerance and investment time horizon,"" Douglas Boneparth, certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth, previously told CNBC Make It. ""But, you still got to live with it."" Other investors may prefer something more stable.Regardless of your tolerance level, financial experts warn that this volatility makes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a riskier investment than something like a low-cost index fund, which allows investors to buy a collection of stocks at once, rather than bet on a single asset.If you decide to invest anyway, ""you have to make sure that it's money that you can really afford to lose,"" Jariwala said.Boneparth agrees: ""Be very careful about how much you allocate and understanding what you can tolerate, because if 80% of your net worth is tied to bitcoin, and it goes down 30%, that's rough.""Depending on what you can afford, a smaller allocation in bitcoin can hedge any potential downturns in the market.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: This 29-year-old launched a business to support Black NFT artists—and it made $140,000 in 10 months"
2022-01-21,"Shares of MicroStrategy tumbled 17.8% Friday afternoon after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly rejected the company's bitcoin accounting strategy.The business-intelligence software company's stock had been falling in tandem with the price of bitcoin, which dropped more than 10% Friday to its lowest point since August. MicroStrategy shares are down 24.7% for the week.A filing released Thursday showed the SEC rejecting the accounting method MicroStrategy was using for bitcoin in its earnings reporting.""We note your response to prior comment 5 and we object to your adjustment for bitcoin impairment charges in your non-GAAP measures,"" the filing said. ""Please revise to remove this adjustment in future filings."" MicroStrategy began buying bitcoin as part of a capital allocation strategy in 2020, setting it apart from other companies. It has been aggressively buying bitcoin ever since, making its shares a proxy for the cryptocurrency.As of the end of 2021, MicroStrategy held 124,391 bitcoins, acquired for roughly $3.75 billion at an average price of about $30,159 per bitcoin, CEO Michael Saylor announced on Twitter at the time."
2022-01-21,"Bitcoin prices fell sharply on Friday, while ether prices also dived, wiping off nearly $150 billion from the crypto market.Bitcoin fell about 15% and was trading around $36,000 late Friday, according to Coin Metrics. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, dived about 20% to trade around $2,500.The declines in cryptocurrencies follow Wall Street losses on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite lost 7.6% this week, and the S&P 500 fell 5.7% for its third straight weekly decline.Rising rates have prompted investors to shed positions in riskier assets. Earlier this week, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield traded above 1.9%.The Federal Reserve have also indicated it plans to begin reducing its balance sheet, as well as tapering of bonds and raising interest rates. A common investment case for bitcoin is that it serves as a hedge against rising inflation as a result of government stimulus, but analysts are saying the risk is that a more hawkish Federal Reserve may take the wind out of bitcoin's sails.Bitcoin prices have fallen sharply since November, tumbling more than 40% from a record high of about $69,000.Some experts warn that the crypto market could be heading toward a downturn soon, as heightened regulatory scrutiny and intense price fluctuations dampened bitcoin's prospects.

Former Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein said his view of cryptocurrencies has evolved after digital assets attracted trillions of dollars in value and a rapidly growing ecosystem.On Monday, Blankfein was asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on ""Squawk Box"" for his view on the nascent asset class, who noted that the former banker has voiced skepticism in the past.""Look, my view of it is evolving,"" Blankfein said.

Traditional financial companies including Goldman have begun offering clients ways to buy, trade and custody digital currencies, and a parallel universe of decentralized finance protocols has emerged so holders can lend out and earn yield on their coins.Cryptocurrencies have been selling off for weeks as expectations of rising interest rates hit riskier assets.

""Of course, we have the benefits of instantaneous transfer and reduction of credit risk and all the benefits of blockchain.""In the past, Blankfein has criticized bitcoin as a store of value and said that regulators should be ""hyperventilating"" over its rise.""I may be skeptical, but I'm also pragmatic about it,"" Blankfein said Monday. ""And so guess what? I would certainly want to have an oar in that water.""In the wide-ranging interview, Blankfein discussed how uncertainty over inflation has caused bearishness throughout markets in recent weeks. He also said that banks trade at an ""unbelievably low multiple"" and that some of the best investments are made in declining markets."
2022-01-24,"Bitcoin climbed into positive territory after falling below $33,000 to a new low.The No. 1 cryptocurrency and ether are sitting about 45% and 49% from their respective all-time highs.The steep declines have been correlated to the selling seen in higher risk assets like technology stocks as investors prepare for higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin bounced into positive territory Monday after initially continuing its slide from last week.On Monday, bitcoin fell to $32,982.11, its lowest point since July, according to Coin Metrics, but the largest cryptocurrency by market cap was up 5.6% in afternoon trading, to $37,183.25, as broader equities reversed course and ended the day higher. Earlier in the session, the Dow fell as much as 1,115 points and the S&P 500 briefly fell into correction territory.Ether plunged to as low as $2,176.41, its lowest since July, according to Coin Metrics. It last rose 1.1% to $2,444.85. Bitcoin and ether are about 45% and 49% off their respective all-time highs.Cryptocurrencies have been moving in tandem with stocks, which have continued to fall since the beginning of the year and just came off of their worst week since March 2020. Investors have been selling risk assets like technology stocks, as they prepare for tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.""It's possible that macroeconomic concerns, such as the Fed's response to inflation rates, have facilitated more de-risking activity in general,"" said Juthica Chou, head of OTC options trading at Kraken. ""The recent price drop, coupled with high volatility, could be leading to further selling as participants look to reduce risk."" Loading chart... Investors also are assessing the impact of further regulation on the cryptocurrency market. Last week, Russia's central bank proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies.Given current market sentiment, bitcoin is likely to test the $30,000-$32,000 range, according to Vijay Ayyar, Luno's vice president of corporate development and international expansion. If the cryptocurrency holds above $30,000 for as long as one week, there could be a base formed at those levels before the market moves higher, he said. However, it could be some time for the market to turn bullish given the lack of confidence across the spectrum, he added.Several other analysts have said they see $30,000 as the next level of support for the cryptocurrency to test. However, analyst John Roque of 22V Research said bitcoin could fall even further. He also has been using $30,000 as a target but noted the median historical bear market for bitcoin is down 78%.  ""A 78% decline from the bitcoin high of nearly $69,000 would imply a potential downside figure of about $15,000,"" he said in a note Monday. ""It's probably safe to say that not one bitcoin bull has that figure in their model. To be sure, we don't either… but we think it's worth keeping in our back pocket in case we need it.""Investors are also grappling with rising inflation. Bitcoin proponents have long suggested the digital coin is a hedge against inflation, but that theory has not held up for many newer investors. As institutional interest poured into bitcoin last year, there are more short-term investors in the crypto market valuing bitcoin like a tech stock than ever before. Analysts have said there's concern a more hawkish Fed could take the wind out of the crypto market's sails.""Looking forward, our most immediate concern is how equities markets respond to this week's Fed meeting, especially after having just endured their worst week since the global onset of Covid,"" said Leah Wald, CEO at digital asset investment manager Valkyrie Funds.""A consolidation in stocks would lead to a risk-on environment where traders are more willing to take on additional risk assets such as bitcoin,"" she added, ""since digital assets have become increasingly correlated to equities as more companies continue to add bitcoin to their balance sheets.

2022-01-24,"Charts suggest that the selling in the world's two largest cryptocurrencies may run its course soon, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday.""To me, that says it might be too late to sell and you need to consider buying. I know I am, especially if we get a final leg down,"" Cramer said.The ""Mad Money"" host rooted his comments in analysis from veteran technician Tom DeMark. Charts suggest the selling in the world's two largest cryptocurrencies may run its course soon, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday, leaning on analysis from veteran technician Tom DeMark.""When the charts, as interpreted by Tom DeMark, say that both bitcoin and ethereum could be looking at downside trend exhaustion bottoms this week, if not today, I think you need to take him seriously,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.""To me, that says it might be too late to sell and you need to consider buying. I know I am, especially if we get a final leg down,"" added Cramer, who personally owns some ether, which runs on the ethereum blockchain. He previously owned bitcoin, as well.Bitcoin earlier Monday reached its lowest point since July when it fell to $32,982.11 per token, according to Coin Metrics. However, bitcoin reversed course during the trading day, ultimately moving higher to around $36,000. The cryptocurrency remains well off its all-time high of nearly $69,000 reached in the fall.Ether also touched its lowest level since July on Monday, falling as low as $2,176.41 before paring some of those losses, according to Coin Metrics. It's down about 50% from its all-time high. While there's a risk that bitcoin's steep decline in recent weeks could cause structural damage to the cryptocurrency, Cramer said DeMark is betting that will not happen — just like bitcoin's roughly 56% drawdown from April to June 2021 didn't prevent it from setting new highs in the fall. In fact, DeMark notes that bitcoin's current angle of descent is identical to its 2021 plunge, Cramer said. ""In other words, there's a good chance that history continues to repeat itself.""Looking specifically at bitcoin's recent trading, Cramer said the cryptocurrency is at No. 11 of DeMark's well-known 13-session countdown pattern, which the technician uses to identify when a rally or decline will be exhausted. ""We need two more negative closes before his buy trigger fires,"" said Cramer, who added that DeMark also would like to see bitcoin test his downside price targets.If Monday's intraday turnaround ends up leading to only a brief rally, ""DeMark wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin getting hit with a two- or three-day panic selling climax, which could briefly take it all the way down to 26,355,"" Cramer said. Ether ""has already hit 13 on his buy countdown for the first time since the peak. That tells DeMark that we could be looking at a trend exhaustion bottom,"" Cramer said, noting that ""fortunately"" ether also fell beneath DeMark's downside price projection of $2,434.Despite these positive technical indications, DeMark cautions that ether may still fall further. ""If we get another panicked breakdown, he could see [ether] temporarily dipping to $1,859 in a selling climax, but that would be your moment to buy, not sell, into the teeth of the panic,"" Cramer said.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.

2022-01-25,"The IMF is urging El Salvador to discontinue bitcoin's status as legal tender.In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt the world's biggest cryptocurrency as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar. The International Monetary Fund is pushing El Salvador to ditch bitcoin as legal tender, according to a statement released on Tuesday.IMF directors ""stressed that there are large risks associated with the use of bitcoin on financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection, as well as the associated fiscal contingent liabilities.""The report, which was published after bilateral talks with El Salvador, went on to ""urge"" authorities to narrow the scope of its bitcoin law by removing bitcoin's status as legal money. In September 2021, the Central American nation became the world's first country to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar.Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele — who has tethered his political fate to the success of the country's bitcoin experiment — has added hundreds of bitcoin to the country's balance sheet in recent months. On Friday, the president tweeted that he bought an additional $15 million of ""really cheap"" bitcoin, as the crypto market plummeted. Bitcoin is down about 50% from its November record high. The IMF report went on to say that some directors had expressed concern over the risks associated with issuing bitcoin-backed bonds, referring to the president's plan to raise $1 billion via a ""Bitcoin Bond"" in partnership with Blockstream, a digital assets infrastructure company.Part of El Salvador's nationwide move into bitcoin also involved launching a national virtual wallet called Chivo that offers no-fee transactions and allows for quick cross-border payments. For a country where 70% of citizens do not have access to traditional financial services, Chivo is meant to offer a convenient onramp for those who have never been a part of the banking system. IMF directors agreed that the Chivo e-wallet could facilitate digital means of payment, thereby helping to ""boost financial inclusion,"" though they emphasized the need for ""strict regulation and oversight."" Many Salvadorans have reported cases of identity theft, in which hackers use their national ID number to open a Chivo e-wallet, in order to claim the free $30 worth of bitcoin offered by the government as an incentive to open a digital wallet.For months, the IMF has bemoaned Bukele's bitcoin experiment.Tuesday's statement echoes a report shared by the IMF in November, in which the financial regulator wrote that bitcoin's high price volatility translated to significant risks to consumer protection and noted that bitcoin should not be used as legal tender.El Salvador has also been trying since early 2021 to secure a $1.3 billion loan from the IMF — an effort that appears to have soured over this bitcoin row.The country will need to figure out some other backstop to shore up its finances. The IMF predicts that under current policies, public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2026, putting the country on ""an unsustainable path."""

2022-01-25,"There’s a question about “virtual currency” on the front page of your tax return, making it clear you need to disclose crypto activity. If you don’t report transactions and face an IRS audit, you may be hit with interest, penalties or even criminal charges.“You’re playing with fire if you don’t report it,” said David Canedo, a CPA and tax specialist product manager at Accointing. After recent market dips, reporting last year's cryptocurrency profits on your tax return may be less appealing. But hiding taxable activity may lead to IRS trouble, experts warn.In 2021, the digital asset market sailed past $2 trillion, with bitcoin peaking at nearly $69,000 in November and ether growing to almost $5,000 during the same period. While values dropped in December, many investors still had sizable gains.  And the IRS has made it clear they are watching with a yes or no question about ""virtual currency"" near the top of the first page of your tax return.     ""That's where the hammer comes down because they can say that you lied on a government document under penalties of perjury,"" said Ryan Losi, a Richmond, Virginia-based CPA and executive vice president of accounting firm PIASCIK. More from Advice and the Advisor:Tax filing season kicks off.

Cryptocurrency may be subject to capital gains when exchanged or sold at a profit. Swapping digital coins, cashing out for U.S. dollars or even making a purchase may be taxable events, Losi explained.The gain or loss is the difference between your purchase price, known as basis, and the value when selling or exchanging, and your tax rates depend on the length of ownership.  If you held digital assets for more than one year, you might qualify for long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your taxable income.However, many crypto investors sell or exchange more frequently, according to a CNBC survey, triggering short-term capital gains, levied at regular income tax rates, up to 37% for top earners.What's worse, figuring out your basis to calculate your crypto tax bill may not be easy with limited reporting from digital currency exchanges.   If you don't report taxable crypto activity and face an IRS audit, you may incur interest, penalties, or even criminal charges.It may be considered tax evasion or fraud, said David Canedo, a Milwaukee-based CPA and tax specialist product manager at Accointing, a crypto tracking and tax reporting tool.While the chances of IRS scrutiny are lower with limited staffing, the agency may pursue larger amounts of money, he said.  For example, there's a big difference between buying bitcoin in 2012 and cashing out millions of dollars in 2021 versus small trades for $100 profit, Canedo said. But you still have to disclose everything regardless. ""You're playing with fire if you don't report it,"" he said.Although the IRS has a three-year lookback for errors, there is no statute of limitations for fraud, Canedo said.Another risk is whistleblowers, who can report missing activity to the IRS for a percentage of penalties collected, Losi from PIASCIK said.""The number one way the IRS finds out about tax cheats is a former business partner or former spouse,"" he said."

Brett Harrison, president of FTX U.S., said the market turbulence shows how crypto is a ""volatile asset class.""""Volatility cuts both ways,"" he said. ""With all of the large upturns that we've seen in crypto, we have to expect that there are going to be downturns as well. And we're definitely in that period right now.""Harrison said the phenomenon is ""not specific to crypto"" — stock markets have taken a tumble as well. ""I think that we are going to eventually see a bounce back,"" he added.FTX was set up in Hong Kong in 2019 by 29-year-old crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried. The wider company, recently valued by investors at $25 billion, has since moved its headquarters to the Bahamas.Bankman-Fried established FTX U.S. as the American sister to distinguish it from his main exchange, as officials in Washington began taking a closer look at the digital currency market. Trading launched on the platform in May 2020. In a trading update Wednesday, FTX U.S. said average daily volumes on its platform grew sevenfold in 2021, peaking at more than $800 million in November after bitcoin notched a record high of almost $69,000.The company facilitated more than $67 billion in spot crypto trades last year. It now has around 1.2 million registered users in total.FTX U.S. hopes the investment will help it gain an edge over rivals like Coinbase and Robinhood. Like FTX, the company is making a push into derivatives — contracts that allow investors to speculate on the performance of an asset. It acquired LedgerX, a crypto futures and options exchange, in October.Harrison says the U.S. market for crypto derivatives pales in comparison to the international marketplace. Investors see that there's ""an enormous opportunity for us to bring much of that volume onshore,"" he added.Coinbase is looking to make similar moves beyond spot trading, agreeing a deal to buy derivatives exchange FairX earlier this month. Still, regulators are growing concerned by the rapid rise of the crypto industry. They fear certain aspects of the market may pose the threat of contagion across financial markets, and that consumers are getting into crypto investments without knowing the risks involved.President Joe Biden's administration is reportedly expected to deliver an executive order calling for regulation of digital assets as early as next month.Harrison said officials in Washington have two primary concerns with crypto — stablecoins and oversight of exchanges.Digital currencies like tether and Circle's USD Coin are meant to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, but it's not that simple. Tether has admitted its reserves include short-term debt obligations and other assets as well as dollars. And, up until recently, USD Coin's reserves had included assets other than cash and U.S. government bonds.Meanwhile, crypto exchanges are currently regulated in the U.S. as money transfer businesses. Harrison says that's ""not a sustainable long-term future"" and wants stricter oversight with rules against market manipulation, a major source of concern in the crypto market."

Sources speaking to Bloomberg also say that the company is trying to find a new destination for the engineers who developed this technology.  Mark Zuckerberg's ambitious plan to build his own cryptocurrency is falling apart, amid growing pressure from regulators.The Diem Association, which oversees development of the Diem digital currency, is considering a sale of its assets, in order to return capital to its investors, according to a Bloomberg report released Wednesday morning.A spokesperson for the Diem Association declined to comment. Facebook's parent company, Meta, did not respond to a request for comment.Diem is reportedly in talks now with investment bankers about next steps, including how to sell its intellectual property, in an effort to capture whatever value is left. Sources speaking to Bloomberg say that the company is also trying to find a new destination for the engineers who developed this technology.Discussions are apparently still in early stages, and there is no guarantee that Diem will find a buyer. Even if it does, the report noted that it is unclear how it would set a value on the project's intellectual property, or the engineers who developed it.One of the people speaking to Bloomberg under condition of anonymity says that Meta owns about a third of the venture, and the remainder is owned by association members, such as Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital. Zuckerberg's beleaguered crypto project has been stymied by drama since it was first announced in June 2019.At the time, the cryptocurrency was called Libra, and it was initially conceived of as a stablecoin, which is a specific subset of cryptocurrencies that have a value pegged to a real-world asset, such as a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or a commodity like gold. In the case of Zuckerberg's stablecoin, the initial plan was to launch a universal currency tied to a basket of major currencies and government debt.The project was instantly met with hostility from central bankers and politicians, who feared it might facilitate nefarious activities such as money laundering and privacy infringement, as well as prove a formidable rival to sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar. In the wake of regulatory backlash, the embattled project pivoted to the concept of launching multiple stablecoins, each of which would be pegged to a fiat currency, plus one multicurrency coin.Ultimately, the vision for the cryptocurrency was slimmed down to a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin known as Diem USD.The project itself has also followed a somewhat convoluted chain of ownership and suffered an exodus of corporate partners and top-level executives.It also once had the backing of multiple partners, but as the Meta chief headed to Capitol Hill to defend the project, key backers like Visa, Mastercard and PayPal abandoned the project. In November of last year, David Marcus, the head of Meta's cryptocurrency efforts, announced that he, too, would be leaving."
2022-01-26,"Paris Hilton believes everything is going digital.That's why the 40-year-old hotel heiress is betting big on cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and now the metaverse.""I just really believe in them,"" Hilton, a longtime socialite and media personality whose enthusiasm comes from six years and counting of crypto investing, tells CNBC Make It.Hilton didn't disclose how much she has invested in crypto, but says she started investing in both bitcoin and ether in 2016. At the time, one bitcoin was valued at around $1,000 and one ether was priced around $10, according to Coin Metrics data. Today, they're worth more than $38,000 and $2,640, respectively.Hilton told The Guardian in November that she first started investing in crypto after becoming ""friends"" with the founders of ethereum, the decentralized computing platform that produces ether, the currency in which a majority of NFTs are traded. Now, even amid a recent cryptocurrency market selloff, during which both bitcoin and ether lost about 50% of their market value from their all-time highs in November, Hilton is still bullish.""I see digital currencies definitely rising [again],"" Hilton says. ""Right now, what I did, which is what people say, is buy the dip.""""Buy the dip"" refers to the concept of buying an asset after it has dropped in price, and hoping it'll rise again in the future. Investing experts warn that you should only invest money into crypto that you are willing to lose: Jumping in because the price has dropped shouldn't be your sole reason, Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington, D.C., told CNBC on Monday.Better reasons, Johnson said, include using crypto assets as stores of value and taking advantage of increasing crypto adoption rates across the world.As for NFTs, Hilton created her first one in 2019, and sold it in March 2020 for charity, winning ""Best Charity NFT"" at that year's NFT awards ceremony. In April 2021, she launched her own NFT collection, selling one called the ""Iconic Crypto Queen"" for $1.1 million in ether. She buys them, too: Hilton told The Guardian that she owned more than 150 NFTs.Most recently, the socialite joined NFT platform Origin Protocol as an investor and strategic advisor to help people mint their own NFTS and sell them on the site's platform.Hilton says creating art — like NFTs — has been therapeutic and healing for her. ""I see NFTs as the future of art,"" she says, noting that in the traditional art world, artists rarely get secondary sales like they often do with NFTs. ""I love that it gives power back to the creators.""She says her next NFT collection will focus on her life's story, including all its well-known highs and lows. In recent years, Hilton has been outspoken about the alleged abuse she endured at a Utah boarding school as a teen, and how it took a toll on her life ever since.""But now, I've really taken back my power and become a businesswoman and a social advocate,"" she says. ""I'm using my platform for good and positive change.""NFTs also go hand-in-hand with the metaverse, a network of 3D virtual worlds where people can work, play and explore — and a place where many are looking forward to showcasing their NFT collections. Hilton says she has been interested in the concept for years, well before Facebook rebranded as Meta and set the business world alight with metaverse buzz.In 2017, ""I was already developing, like, this whole 'Paris World' where people could watch me DJ and come hang out,"" she says.Paris World eventually became an outpost on gaming company Roblox's platform, which launched in October. This past New Year's Eve, Hilton used Paris World to host her first metaverse party. The virtual gathering was double the size of the crowd in New York City's Times Square that night, she says. (Roblox did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for confirmation.)""I thought that was amazing, and that was just the beta opening of it,"" Hilton says. ""The possibilities are truly endless.""Next up, she says: bringing NFTs into Paris World, building a new line of digital wearables and creating a digital fashion brand.Don't miss:Bitcoin vs. gold: Here's what billionaire Ray Dalio thinksNBA legend Shaquille O’Neal explains why he hasn’t invested in cryptoNBA legend Charles Barkley: My advisors 'don't believe in crypto'"

Google's cloud division has formed a group to build business around blockchain applications, following efforts to grow in retail, health care and other industries.Success could help Google further diversify away from advertising and become more prominent in the growing market for computing and storage services delivered from remote third-party data centers.Blockchain advocates often talk about constructing decentralized applications that leave large intermediaries out of the equation. In particular, DeFi (short for ""decentralized finance"") is a rapidly growing sector of the crypto market that aims to cut out middlemen, such as banks, from traditional financial transactions, like securing a loan.With DeFi, banks and lawyers are replaced by a programmable piece of code called a smart contract. This contract is written on a public blockchain, like ethereum or solana, and it executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary. This idea of decentralized apps has become more popular among technologists who envision Web3, a decentralized version of the internet that breaks away from Web 2.0, which saw an explosion of user-generated content such as blogs and social networks. Some of those services eventually came to be owned by large internet players — including Google, which bought Blogger and YouTube (which is now one of its strongest businesses).Today Amazon, Google and other cloud-computing providers represent a type of centralization, by operating vast facilities that offer computing services to millions of customers.

As customers in those sectors choose to adopt blockchain technologies, Google can help, Widmann said. Other cloud providers have become crypto-curious, too, although none other than Google has announced the establishment of a blockchain business group.Amazon Web Services, which led the cloud infrastructure market in 2020 with 40.8% share, according to technology industry researcher Gartner, announced a managed blockchain service in 2018. The website for the AWS service identifies Accenture, AT&T and Nestle as customers.Microsoft, which Gartner said had 19.7% share in 2020, introduced a fully managed Azure Blockchain Service in 2019 but retired it in September, citing ""lowered interest"" in a blog post. Smaller cloud providers are also aware of the opportunity.""We have a lot of blockchain and crypto customers on the platform,"" said Gabe Monroy, chief product officer at DigitalOcean, which focuses on small and midsize businesses. ""It was one of our biggest cohort growth segments over 2021. We're definitely paying close attention to the space.""Cryptocurrency companies are also starting to cater to software developers. Cryptocurrency exchange operator Coinbase has announced a slew of services under the banner Coinbase Cloud, and it describes the tools as being capable of running on multiple clouds.""This is kind of like our AWS for crypto,"" Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at the JPMorgan Crypto Economy Forum in November. ""We're trying to externalize some of the services that we've had to build. A lot of hard engineering has gone into how do we store crypto and integrate all the blockchains and monitor transactions for AML purposes and do trading and staking and all that.""Meanwhile, the founders of San Francisco start-up Alchemy told CNBC that they hope to be compared with AWS in the blockchain realm. Alchemy announced in October that it had raised venture capital at a $3.5 billion valuation.Google has been making itself more comfortable in the blockchain universe lately.Company veteran Shivakumar Venkataraman has taken charge of a new blockchain group, Bloomberg reported last week.

2022-01-27,"The idea of higher interest rates have spooked stock investors.The S&P 500 stock index is down more than 9% in January as of 2 p.m. ET Thursday.A slower U.S. economy (and lower corporate earnings) as well as the prospect of less risky assets like bonds becoming more attractive may result from higher interest rates, according to financial experts. The specter of rising interest rates is spooking the stock market.The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, is expected to increase its benchmark rate several times this year to tame stubbornly high inflation. Fed chair Jerome Powell affirmed that likelihood on Wednesday.related investing newsBank of America hikes year-end target for S&P 500, citing focus by companies on efficiency and A.I.Jesse Pounda day agoThe move would increase borrowing costs from near zero — where they've been since the beginning of the Covid pandemic — for businesses and consumers.  The forecast has caused stocks to nosedive in January.The S&P 500 index is down about 9% for the year. At one point this week, the basket of U.S. stocks dipped below 10% — the first time that's happened since the initial pandemic turmoil of March 2020. The index closed down 0.2% Wednesday after Powell's remarks, erasing earlier gains. Why does the stock market care?Broadly, the reasons seem to be twofold: A slowdown of the U.S. economy and the prospect of other investments like bonds becoming more attractive relative to stocks.When the Fed raises its benchmark interest rate, banks and lenders tend to raise borrowing costs, too. Mortgages, credit cards and other debt become pricier, reducing consumer spending and demand. Businesses also pay more to finance their operations.More from Personal Finance:What the Fed's plan to raise interest rates means for youWhy new parents may qualify for another $1,400 stimulus check3 reasons to keep your will or estate plan updatedBroadly, this dampens the outlook for company profits and reduces investor enthusiasm for buying their stock.  ""A tightening of monetary policy will put pressure on economic activity,"" according to Blair duQuesnay, a certified financial planner and investment advisor at Ritholtz Wealth Management, who is based in New Orleans. ""And it's by design."" The Fed's ""design"" is to cool off inflation. Consumer prices jumped 7% in December from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 1982.But the stock market isn't reacting just to a likely rate bump; stock gyrations have as much to do with uncertainty over how fast the Fed will accelerate.""What the market doesn't like, is rapid changes in the monetary landscape,"" according to David Stubbs, the global head of cross-asset thematic strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. When inflation began accelerating in early 2021, Fed officials signaled it was likely temporary, the short-term result of a hyperactive economy emerging from its pandemic hibernation.Now, their tone has shifted as inflation has lingered well above the Fed's 2% long-run target. In large part, that seems due to consumer demand for physical goods outstripping supply, as Covid continues to disrupt manufacturers.""Since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse,"" Powell said Wednesday. ""I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that,"" he added.  Investors worry an aggressive Fed response may slam the brakes on the economy — though Powell has sought to reassure the policy response will be ""nimble.""Anxiety over that outcome is the main reason for market jitters, according to CFP Lee Baker, founder of Apex Financial Services in Atlanta.""What are the trickle-down effects if the Fed raises rates too far, too fast? If it slows down the economy, what does that do to [company] earnings? You just sort of follow that domino,"" Baker said. ""If you're talking about earnings, you're talking about stocks.""(This discussion is relative to a broad basket of U.S. stocks. It's not true that all companies necessarily suffer if rates rise. Some may do better — like a bank, for example, that charges more to lend.) If rates rise, investors may see more value in bonds, certificates of deposit and other assets thought to be less risky than stocks.Yields in those conservative assets have been relatively paltry since the 2008 financial crisis, which led to a prolonged period of rock-bottom interest rates to spur the economy. Investors looking for returns were essentially ""forced"" into stocks, Baker said.The value proposition may change, if bond yields and CD rates move upward in tandem with the Fed's benchmark rate. Though it seems to play the biggest role, Fed policy isn't the only thing putting investors on edge.For one, there's the prospect of war between Ukraine and Russia. Those geopolitical tensions fuel more uncertainty — for example, how might the energy sector be impacted if fighting breaks out?The stock selloff may be a good thing, independent of what's causing it, duQuesnay said. The Federal Reserve is discussing higher interest rates because the economy and labor markets are strong; a reduction in stock prices may also tether lofty company valuations more to reality, she said.""If you take away all the outside news and information about the stock market, it's gone up double digits for three years in a row,"" according to duQuesnay. ""Maybe it should sell off despite anything else."""

Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has given an ominous warning about the volatile cryptocurrency market, comparing it to the subprime mortgage crisis of the late 2000s.In an opinion piece for The New York Times on Thursday, Krugman said he's ""seeing uncomfortable parallels"" between crypto and the U.S. subprime crash, which brought the whole housing market to its knees and triggered the 2007-2008 global financial crisis.related investing newsMorgan Stanley sees a sign that points to a top in bitcoinTanaya Macheel14 hours ago""There are disturbing echoes of the subprime crash 15 years ago,"" Krugman says in the piece.The subprime crisis was essentially the result of banks making loans out to people of higher risk, at a time when interest rates were low and house prices were soaring. Once the market became saturated, homeowners found themselves in negative equity unable to repay their loans, resulting in hefty losses for lenders.Krugman argues crypto investors are similarly being sold speculative financial products without truly understanding the risks involved. It's worth noting Krugman is a known bitcoin bear, having previously likened the cryptocurrency to a Ponzi scheme. ""Many borrowers didn't understand what they were getting into,"" he said in the NYT op-ed. ""And cryptocurrencies, with their huge price fluctuations seemingly unrelated to fundamentals, are about as risky as an asset class can get.""The Nobel laureate isn't convinced cryptocurrencies pose a systemic risk, however: ""The numbers aren't big enough to do that."" The entire crypto market is worth roughly $1.7 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.Bitcoin and other digital currencies have dropped sharply in recent weeks.

Cryptocurrency exchange FTX saw its valuation swell to $32 billion in a new funding round announced Monday, highlighting continued appetite for the sector even as investors grow wary about a sharp pullback in crypto prices.The Bahamas-based company said Monday that it raised $400 million in a Series C financing round — its third fundraise in the last nine months.FTX, which offers derivatives products as well as spot trading, is one of the world's largest digital currency exchanges. Once an obscure name, the firm has become a key player in the nascent market, rivaling the likes of Coinbase and Binance.The company doesn't offer trading in the United States. That function is provided by FTX U.S., its sister exchange. Last week, FTX U.S. announced a $400 million investment valuing the firm at $8 billion.FTX said all investors in the U.S. affiliate, which included Singaporean state investor Temasek, SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global, jumped aboard for its own fundraise.Having now raised a combined $2 billion in venture funding to date, FTX has built up a war chest at a time when digital currency prices have sunk considerably. Bitcoin is down 46% from its November record of almost $69,000, while other cryptocurrencies have slumped even further. That's led to fears the market may be on the cusp of a more severe downturn known as ""crypto winter."" The last such occurrence happened in late 2017 and early 2018, when bitcoin tanked as much as 80% from its then-record high. Bear markets are typically bad news for crypto exchanges as it means volumes tend to dry up.""I think we're not entering a long term crypto winter,"" Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's CEO and co-founder, told CNBC in an interview.""There have been changes in expectations of interest rates, and that's been moving crypto markets. But it's been moving markets more generally as well.""Indeed, stocks have taken a battering in recent weeks, with the Nasdaq down 11% year-to-date as investors reevaluate tech stocks amid concerns over higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Coinbase, FTX's publicly-listed rival, has seen its shares slide 46% since debuting on the Nasdaq last April.Asked whether his company could seek an initial public offering, Bankman-Fried said ""it's something we've been talking about.""""I'm not sure whether we will. I could see it happening, I could see it not happening. We don't feel like we have any particular need to do it.""However, he said the firm will ""try and be prepared, in case it's something that we do end up wanting to do."" Such preparations would include audited accounts and a review of possible listing options, he added.While the crypto market has seen seismic growth over the past couple of years, regulators have become increasingly wary about digital assets, concerned about their use in scams and other illicit activity. A large focus for FTX, Bankman-Fried said, is acquiring licenses in several countries. Its U.S. arm is now authorized to sell derivatives products such as futures and options, which allow investors to speculate on movements in the price of an asset. Bankman-Fried said FTX's international business will be licensed across ""the bulk of the Western world"" by the end of this year.The company plans to use the fresh funds to continue developing new products. FTX last year launched a marketplace for trading non-fungible tokens — the crypto world's answer to collectible items — and is now starting to license its software to other businesses in the realms of fintech and gaming, Bankman-Fried said.FTX said its user base grew 60% since October 2021, when it last raised money at a $25 billion valuation, while daily trading volumes rose 40% to an average of $14 billion. The company recently established a $2 billion venture fund to invest in crypto start-ups. FTX was founded almost three years ago by Bankman-Fried and fellow co-founder Gary Wang.While Bankman-Fried may have started his career as a trader at the Wall Street firm Jane Street, the crypto boss is not your typical finance executive. He lives on a vegan diet, wears t-shirts and shorts, and is based in a sunny island country.He does, however, share one similarity with traditional financial types: long working hours. Bankman-Fried previously said he functions on as little as four hours of sleep a night. He says he sleeps ""a bit more"" now, but ""not a ton.""FTX's latest investment places it among the most valuable private crypto start-ups globally.  At just 29, Bankman-Fried is one of the richest people in crypto, having amassed a net worth of over $22 billion, according to Forbes. With his shares now worth more, that figure is likely to be even higher.Bankman-Fried built an early fortune trading bitcoin at his quantitative trading firm Alameda Research. He used arbitrage, a trading strategy where investors look to profit from a divergence in prices for the same asset across different exchanges."

Silvergate Capital CEO Alan Lane told CNBC on Monday the bank holding company hopes to launch a stablecoin by the end of this year, following its acquisitions of assets and intellectual property from Mark Zuckerberg's beleaguered cryptocurrency project. The California-based financial firm, which through its subsidiary Silvergate Bank operates the crypto-focused payments platform Silvergate Exchange Network, confirmed it was buying assets from the Diem Group on Monday. Silvergate had previously been a partner on the Facebook-backed project. ""The Facebook engineers that developed this over the last couple years are truly world-class engineers,"" Lane told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer in an interview. ""We were working last year with Diem and we got to know the team very well, and we couldn't be more excited to, essentially, be taking the reigns and bringing a stablecoin to market hopefully later this year."" With Lane at the helm, Silvergate Bank is known for being one of the first traditional banks to embrace digital currencies. Its Silvergate Exchange Network offers account holders the ability to execute real-time, 24/7 transfer among themselves. Crypto trading platforms such as Coinbase Global and Gemini are part of the Silvergate Exchange Network. Lane told Cramer that Silvergate hopes to expand the everyday usefulness of stablecoins, which are a type of digital asset that has its value pegged to traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Right now, Lane said they're mostly used in crypto trading. ""We think the potential worth is off the charts when we think about using the blockchain technology for payments and remittance,"" Lane said, after Cramer asked how much Silvergate thinks Diem's assets are worth. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the bank paid about $200 million, citing an anonymous source. The Silvergate Exchange Network is already used by existing stablecoin issuers to create and redeem the digital tokens, Lane said. ""But again, those are primarily used for cryptocurrency trading. Where we see the opportunity is creating a stablecoin that could be used by folks .... to pay for things."" ""It's kind of the original promise of bitcoin, but folks don't want to be spending their bitcoin with all that volatility. But the blockchain technology is here, and we think that's what a Silvergate-issued stablecoin can provide,"" he said.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.

Businesses will be subject to the tax from June 1, 2023.The country's statutory tax rate will be 9% for taxable income exceeding 375,000 UAE dirhams ($102,000), and zero for taxable income up to that amount ""to support small businesses and startups,"" the ministry said, adding that ""the UAE corporate tax regime will be amongst the most competitive in the world.""Individuals will still not be subject to tax on their incomes from employment, real estate, equity investments or other personal income unrelated to a UAE trade or business, the ministry said. The tax also won't be applied to foreign investors who don't conduct business in the country.As for what constitutes profit, corporate tax will apply on ""the adjusted accounting net profit"" of the business.Free zone business, meanwhile — thousands of which exist in the country — can ""continue to benefit from corporate tax incentives"" as long as they ""meet all necessary requirements,"" the ministry said, without elaborating. Companies within the UAE's many free zones have long enjoyed zero taxes and full foreign ownership, among other benefits.""The UAE corporate tax regime has been designed to incorporate best practices globally and minimise the compliance burden on businesses,"" state news agency WAM wrote.""Corporate tax will be payable on the profits of UAE businesses as reported in their financial statements prepared in accordance with internationally acceptable accounting standards, with minimal exceptions and adjustments. The corporate tax will apply to all businesses and commercial activities alike, except for the extraction of natural resources which will remain subject to Emirate level corporate taxation."" While the news made waves after its announcement on Monday, many in the UAE's business scene say the development shouldn't come as a shock.""I don't think this announcement should come as a surprise; corporation tax in the UAE has been in discussion for several years. And there is already corporation tax in the GCC, in Saudi and Qatar for instance,"" Chris Payne, chief economist at Dubai-based Peninsula Real Estate, told CNBC. As the UAE, like many of its oil-rich regional counterparts, pushes to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbon revenue, ""it's important that the Federal government establishes sources of income that are not reliant on corporate dividends and investment income, both of which can be volatile,"" Payne added.The announcement gives companies in the UAE roughly a year-and-a-half to prepare for taxes, but reactions are mixed on whether the move will allow the Gulf sheikhdom to retain its attractiveness to businesses.Mark Hemmings, vice president of tax and treasury at Dubai-based specialty services firm Kent, views the decision as ""practical and sensible.""""It will be very interesting to see the detail, but at first glance this looks like a practical and sensible approach to ensure companies in the UAE can comply with the anticipated new international tax rules, whilst ensuring the UAE remains an attractive location for businesses to operate,"" Hemmings said. Still, the threshold for being subject to taxation — just over $100,000 of profit a year — is fairly low and could adversely affect smaller enterprises with high set-up and business renewal costs. Rupert Tait, co-founder of UAE-based construction tech start-up Procurified, sees potential headwinds for small businesses like his.""I think that as a start-up founder we want to base ourselves in the most affordable environment to grow,"" he told CNBC. ""While I understand the need for taxation to start, I also know we are indirectly taxed in free zones,"" he said, explaining that his company based in the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre free zone already pays 20,000 UAE dirhams (roughly $5,450) per year, which is paid regardless of profit.""So the corporate tax may cause SMEs to reconsider where they plan to remain (long-term) due to heavy upfront fees and then tax once the business is profitable,"" Tait said. Nonetheless, the proposed tax remains low compared to other low-tax hubs around the world.Montenegro and Gibraltar have tax rates of 9% and 10% respectively, while Ireland and Lichtenstein both offer a 12.5% corporate tax rate. Hong Kong's taxes range from 8.5% to 16.5%, and Singapore and San Marino both have tax rates of 17%. Still, it's yet to be seen what goods and services will be provided in exchange for the new taxes.Ultimately, the move ""brings the UAE in line with other competitive economies,"" said Taufiq Rahim, a non-resident a research fellow at the Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government in Dubai.""And the rate — while new for the private sector here — remains lower than other jurisdictions like Singapore and Hong Kong."""
2022-02-01,"It's officially tax season, and if you were among the many trading cryptocurrency this past year, it's time to report your activity on your 2021 tax return.This applies to those who sold or spent their cryptocurrency, those who exchanged one cryptocurrency for another and those who engaged in other taxable events, such as earning interest on cryptocurrency, in 2021. Anyone who simply bought and held cryptocurrency won't be liable yet.Though the tax bill might sting, it's important to report accurately and not attempt to understate your income, warns certified public accountant Shehan Chandrasekera.Calculating the taxes you owe on your cryptocurrency and nonfungible token (NFT) activity can be difficult, especially if you have multiple wallets, use different exchanges or don't use any software to track your transactions. That's why, ""generally speaking, people are afraid of taxes,"" Chandrasekera, who is also head of tax strategy at cryptocurrency software company CoinTracker, tells CNBC Make It.However, there are ways that you can ""actively use the tax code to your advantage,"" he says, which can be ""a huge incentive."" This can make compliance ""benefit-driven"" rather than fear-driven, he says.Here are three things that ""savvy investors do,"" according to Chandrasekera. Chandrasekera recommends a strategy called tax-loss harvesting, where investors sell their cryptocurrency at a loss in order to offset their gains.""Losses can be used to offset your crypto gains, stock gains and even regular income. Instead of holding your underwater positions, you can sell them, buy back and harvest the loss,"" he says.For this to work, investors must know how much they bought their cryptocurrency for to begin with, known as their cost basis, so they can calculate the difference. This requires careful record keeping and can be difficult without the use of a reputable software tool that tracks your transactions for tax reporting. But if done correctly, it can create significant tax savings.Keep in mind that you can only offset capital gains with the same type of losses, so long-term losses are used to reduce long-term gains, and short-term losses are used to reduce short-term gains.Cryptocurrency is not subject to what are called ""wash sale rules,"" so ""you don't have to wait 30 days to buy back the same position,"" Chandrasekera says.Wash sale rules prevent investors from immediately buying back the same stock after selling at a loss. Though policymakers proposed imposing wash sale rules on commodities, currencies and digital assets in the Build Back Better Act, the legislation has not been passed. Investors should understand the difference between long-term and short-term capital gains tax rates, Chandrasekera says. Long-term capital gains are realized when an investor sells after holding an asset for at least 12 months, while short-term capital gains are realized when investments are sold in less than 12 months.""Savvy investors are aware of the tax benefit you have when you sell your coins after holding them for more than 12 months,"" he says.That's because long-term capital gains tax rates are usually more favorable than short-term rates, which are typically the same as regular income tax rates and range from 10% to 37%. Long-term rates, on the other hand, can be 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your taxable income.And remember, if you don't sell any crypto or engage in any other taxable events, you aren't required to pay taxes yet. Chandrasekera also recommends using the highest in, first out (HIFO) accounting method to calculate capital gains and losses.When using HIFO, you sell the cryptocurrency that has the highest cost basis first to reduce the amount of capital gains you need to pay taxes on.Say an investor bought two bitcoins in 2017, one for $4,000 in September and another for $6,000 in October. If he sold one for $20,000 in 2020, he can use the HIFO method to report the $6,000 as his cost basis, regardless of which bitcoin he sold. This would result in fewer capital gains filed.Again, this requires very detailed record keeping. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) see this as an investors' responsibility and requires individuals to keep records ""sufficient to establish the positions taken on tax returns,"" according to its website.Taxes — cryptocurrency related or not — are complicated.

Over the past two years, the People's Bank of China has been carrying out trials in the form of lotteries, where digital yuan is handed out to citizens in certain cities for them to spend. More recently, the central bank has looked to expand the use of the digital yuan. China has not launched its digital currency nationwide yet and has no timeline to do so, however.Elsewhere, Japan is looking into its own CBDC, and the U.S. Federal Reserve last month released a study into a digital dollar, but did not take a firm position on whether it would issue one.While India is pushing forward with a digital rupee, it has tried to take a tougher stance on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and is currently working on regulation for the sector.On Tuesday, Sitharaman said income from the transfer of virtual digital assets should be taxed at rate of 30%.

2022-02-02,"The market for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, exploded last year.In 2021, at least $44.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency was sent to the two types of Ethereum smart contracts ""associated with NFT marketplaces and collections,"" data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis shows. Smart contracts are collections of code that power decentralized applications and NFTs.But with the hype, scammers saw opportunity.Chainalysis found ""small but visible"" money laundering activity in NFTs, according to its new report.

2022-02-02,"FTX said Wednesday it has entered into an agreement to acquire Japanese crypto exchange Liquid for an undisclosed sum.The deal includes Quoine Corporation, which was one of the first crypto exchanges to register with Japan's Financial Services Agency.FTX, which earlier this week announced it had raised $400 million at a $32 billion valuation, is expanding aggressively in the Asian crypto market. FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, is buying Japanese rival Liquid for an undisclosed sum.The company said Wednesday it had entered into an agreement to acquire Liquid and all its operating subsidiaries, including Quoine Corporation and its Singapore-based unit. Quoine was one of the first crypto exchanges to obtain registration with Japan's Financial Services Agency in 2017.FTX said it expects the acquisition of Liquid to close by March 2022. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.""Following FTX's acquisition of Liquid, Quoine will gradually integrate FTX's products and services into its own offering, and FTX's existing Japanese customers will be migrated to Quoine's platform,"" Liquid said in a statement Wednesday.""In connection with this acquisition, FTX has also entered into an agreement with Liquid to provide its existing Japanese users with services in compliance with Japanese laws, and will transfer its existing Japanese users to Quoine.""FTX, which earlier this week announced it had raised $400 million at a $32 billion valuation, is expanding aggressively in the Asian crypto market at a time when competition in the space is heating up.Bankman-Fried told CNBC a large focus for the firm was acquiring licenses in several countries.Traditional lenders like Japan's SBI and Singapore's DBS have been making moves in the space to capitalize on crypto's wild growth. SBI is a minority shareholder in a number of crypto start-ups, including the $15 billion company Ripple, while DBS has set up its own digital asset exchange.Founded in 2014, Liquid is one of the world's largest crypto exchanges by volume, with nearly $72 million in daily trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap data. It offers both spot trading in digital currencies such as bitcoin, ether and XRP, and financial derivatives which allow investors to speculate on price movements.The company suffered a major hack last year which saw the cybercriminals make off with more than $90 million worth of funds. Not long after the attack, FTX lent Liquid $120 million in debt financing. Liquid at the time said the funds would be used to ""strengthen its capital position,"" and that the two firms would pursue ""further collaborative opportunities.""Bahamas-based FTX offers crypto spot trading and derivatives products in a number of territories around the world — with the exception of the U.S., where its services are provided by an affiliate called FTX U.S. FTX U.S. last week said it had raised $400 million in its first external fundraise, in a deal valuing the company at $8 billion."
2022-02-02,"In 2021, Brittany Pierre made over $109,000 selling nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, of her photography and flipping other NFTs she bought for a profit.But before that, Pierre was struggling to pay rent on her Chicago apartment or afford groceries and bus fare, she tells CNBC Make It.Her financial situation was very ""touch and go,"" Pierre, 36, says. She lived paycheck to paycheck and ""got pretty depressed.""In March, Pierre learned about nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. Her friend and fellow artist Elise Swopes had just sold an NFT of her work for over $17,600, inspiring Pierre to try and do the same. In addition to asking Swopes for guidance, ""I dove straight in, just doing a YouTube and a Google deep dive for a couple of days.""One month later, Pierre started to sell her first NFTs and was soon selling pieces for a few hundred dollars each — more than her physical art earned her, she says.""It was real hard to do $50 photoshoots, trying to peddle $30 prints. I'd have bookings here and there, but it wasn't sustainable,"" she says. ""That first couple of $200, $300 [NFT] sales was a lot for me. That's exactly what I needed to pay rent."" As she made more money, Pierre was able to pay her bills and live more comfortably, but also donate to organizations and invest in other artists' NFTs — some of which she's flipped for a return.""Last year has been the first year that I could live completely abundantly, more with my heart, than I ever have been able to,"" she says. ""I've never had a job over $15 an hour, and last year, I was able to make a little over $100,000."" When starting to learn about NFTs, Pierre noticed a few barriers to entry: For most of the top platforms, creators needed to apply or be invited to list their artwork. Once that happens, creators must pay gas fees to mint their NFTs, which can be difficult to afford.Minting an NFT is the process of representing the asset on the blockchain. It allows NFT owners to both prove that they own the asset and be able to sell it if they want. But to mint an NFT, creators must pay what's called a gas fee, which can cost hundreds of dollars during times of high congestion.With the help of a few friends who connected her, Pierre was invited to NFT marketplace Foundation in March by photographer Zak Krevitt. Another artist raised funds to pay Pierre's gas fees for her first couple of pieces so she could mint her work, she says.At the time, ""I probably had like 10 bucks in my bank account,"" she says. ""I think fees [were] about $250.""This process of onboarding and helping fellow artists is common in the NFT and wider Web3 community. ""That is one thing about this space: If you have a question, somebody is going to answer it,"" Pierre says. Through her street style and portraiture photography, ""it's mostly Black women and men that I try to uplift,"" Pierre says. ""When you look up 'beautiful person' on Google, you normally see a white person. So I wanted to put Black people on the blockchain so we can solidify that. I want to highlight the Black experience.""Pierre's first sales occurred after a notable NFT collector known as Weesh saw her art on Twitter. ""After that, I went all in,"" she says.Pierre had found another day job, but she decided to quit and pursue NFTs full-time, she says. The income was life-changing for Pierre.""At first, it started with me paying rent on time and in full without having to make payments. Then, I was able to get groceries — I was living on ramen, ground beef, tuna cans and water for a very long time. I was able to fill my fridge, which I've never been able to do on my own,"" she says.Beyond necessities, Pierre has been able to treat herself. She has bought more film photography equipment, she says, and splurges every once in a while on Nikes. Additionally, Pierre has been saving to buy a Tesla and a place of her own. Overall, her ""quality of life"" has improved, she says. And she's able to help others. If her mom, sister, niece or nephew need anything, Pierre can buy it for them. She also donates to organizations she's passionate about, she says.Pierre also prioritizes giving back to the NFT community by onboarding other women, inviting them to Foundation and paying their gas fees, she says. Pierre sees cryptocurrency and NFTs as a way to build generational wealth, since they allow her to invest and earn money without dealing with traditional financial systems.""I definitely think that not only NFTs, but crypto in general, can help marginalized people, especially the Black community,"" she says.Pierre has been successful in the space, but what she has accomplished isn't necessarily easy or typical. When it comes to investing in cryptocurrency, financial experts recommend being careful, understanding the risks and taking time to research before buying in.Nonetheless, she says, ""I do truly believe that crypto and NFTs can be the path of real financial freedom and freedom from racist systems in government and banks.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:This couple made nearly $120K in under 6 hours selling NFTs to save their home from foreclosureThis 29-year-old launched a business to support Black NFT artists—and it made $140,000 in 10 monthsWhy this mom quit her job to focus on crypto full time and build 'generational wealth'"
2022-02-03,"As a major winter storm descends on Texas, crypto miners are powering down operations to help ease the burden on the state's already beleaguered power grid. The chief concern is that we might see a repeat of February 2021, when a deep freeze devastated large swaths of the state, leaving 10 million Texans without electricity. Hundreds of people died amid the multiday outage. Riot Blockchain has already shut down 99% of its operations at its Texas mine. As a major winter storm descends on Texas, crypto miners are powering down operations to help ease the burden on the state's already beleaguered power grid. The chief concern is that we might see a repeat of February 2021, when a deep freeze devastated large swaths of the state, leaving 10 million Texans without electricity and resulted in a multisystem meltdown that ""was within minutes of a much more serious and potentially complete blackout."" Hundreds of people died amid the multiday outage. Riot Blockchain, one of the biggest publicly traded crypto mining companies in America, began shutting down power to its Rockdale mine on Tuesday, a process that occurs in phases.  ""As the storm has progressed, we have continued to decrease our power consumption by 98%-99%. So currently, we are only using 1%-2% of power,"" said Trystine Payfer, Riot's director of communications. Payfer told CNBC Riot will continue to manage its power usage as needed until there is ""no extreme stress on the ERCOT grid.""Riot's stock closed nearly 7% lower on Wednesday, and it is down over 31% year-to-date. Several other crypto miners across Texas have followed suit in voluntarily curtailing energy consumption in the run-up to the arctic blast.The CEO of Rhodium Enterprises, a fully integrated bitcoin miner using liquid-cooled infrastructure, tweeted that Texas-based bitcoin miners were curtailing their load starting Wednesday, in order to ""help provide excess power reserves"" for the storm. ""We are proud to help stabilize the grid and help our fellow Texans stay warm,"" wrote Rhodium CEO Nathan Nichols.Other crypto miners said they will respond in real-time to the needs of the grid.The grid is called ERCOT, which is short for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the organization tasked with operating it. To run smoothly, ERCOT requires a perfect balance between supply and demand. Having too much power and not enough buyers is just as bad as everyone wanting to fire up their air conditioning units on the same day in July. For years, ERCOT has struggled with fluctuating energy prices and sporadic service, which is why it strikes deals with flexible energy buyers, like crypto miners. Through established ""demand response"" programs, ERCOT will actually pay major industrial users to cut power.""They're expecting the same kind of grid load as you would have at peak summertime, so they'll likely curtail miners at some point on Friday or Saturday,"" explained Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, another major player in the U.S. mining industry.Bitcoin miners specifically, and demand response more generally, are a powerful tool in the toolbox for grid management, according to Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council.Marathon's Thiel tells CNBC that miners have been coordinating with ERCOT since last week to get ahead of any potential problems with the grid.""Everybody wants to collaborate, everybody wants to voluntarily do whatever it takes to support ERCOT,"" he said.The question now is when the baseload that miners use (the baked-in energy demand from miners as a collective) is shut down and transferred back to the grid, does that provide the grid with what it needs to keep functioning as normal?""This is a key test moment for the industry,"" continued Thiel.Whether crypto miners going offline en masse in one of the biggest crypto mining jurisdictions in the world will move the price of bitcoin, the answer is probably no.The supply delta from changing the pace of mining is typically minimal, and any price moves in bitcoin or other major proof-of-work cryptocurrencies would likely have more to do with macro factors and overall risk-off behavior. Many in the mining industry tell CNBC that the next few days are a high-stakes way of testing out whether the narrative of crypto miners being good for the grid bears out under pressure. The state's growing crypto mining contingent ballooned after China banished all crypto miners last May.""Bitcoin miners want to be good stewards of grid stability,"" said Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners. ""We are incentivized financially but also from a political narrative, and therefore, regulatory perspective. We want to show the world we contribute to the health and resilience of the grid, and we know that all eyes will be on us throughout this first big test of the year,"" continued Brammer.That financial incentive is key. Miners are not altruistically opting to do the grid a solid by sometimes powering down some or all of its bitcoin miners to free up electricity for those in need. Instead, there are a lot of financial perks baked into its arrangement with the nonprofit organization that operates Texas' grid. ""Imagine how much you would have to pay Amazon to say, 'Hey, there's too much demand for power. Please power down your data center,'"" said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi, who now runs Meow, a company that enables corporate treasury participation in crypto markets.""But it can do that with bitcoin very easily, because all you have to do is pay the miners slightly more than what they would have made mining for bitcoin that hour,"" continued Arvanaghi, who calls the setup a ""a win-win.""If the grid operators pay the miners a penny more than they would have made from mining in any given hour, then they'll gladly power down. And from Thiel's experience, they get curtailment requests less than 3% of the time in the course of a year, which he estimates comes to about five to ten hours a month.Even bitcoin miners that haven't cut a deal with ERCOT sometimes voluntarily power down at times of peak consumption when prices shoot higher.The price of power per hour is all over the place, routinely going negative.Shaun Connell, the EVP of power at Lancium, tells CNBC that in 2020, the price of energy in West Texas was negative between 10% and 20% of the time. The price dips below zero when supply outpaces demand.In 2021, the price of power per hour was negatively priced 9% of the time, while 5% of all hours peaked above $100. Extreme tails like the ones shown in the chart below aren't a good thing. In 2021, had miners voluntarily cut back their uptime expectation from 100% to 95%, they would have slashed their per megawatt hour price from $178 to $25, according to data from Lancium, a Houston-based energy tech company that specializes in bitcoin mining. Strategically timed energy curtailment proves especially vital for the Texas grid, which exists as its own little island. Unlike the rest of the continental U.S. that belongs to either the Eastern or Western interconnection (the names of the two interconnected power grids linking states), 90% of Texas runs on ERCOT, a deregulated and independent network of energy providers that is not tethered to any other grid in the U.S. While this competitive market often drives down the price of power as providers compete on cost to capture customers, it also means that there is less of a safety net baked into the grid. This presents problems in the face of calamitous events, such as a power shortage or a natural disaster, like the fatal winter storm in early 2021. Adding a ""controllable load resource"" like bitcoin miners to the grid acts as a sort of life insurance policy. It's almost like a hedge against disaster.And it's no skin off the back of bitcoin miners. Bitcoin has no uptime requirement, nor is the gear worn down by regularly powering off and on. It's pretty much a win, win.""That's the beauty of bitcoin — it's something no other industry can really do,"" Arvanaghi told CNBC. ""It's very synergistic."" Not all are convinced that bitcoin miners are the solution.""Miners are a strain on the grid, not a help,"" said Ben Hertz-Shargel of Wood Mackenzie, a provider of commercial intelligence for the world's natural resources sector. Hertz-Shargel is concerned that bitcoin mining would only raise peak demand, ultimately adding stress to the system.Hertz-Shargel predicts that bitcoin could more than double demand growth in ERCOT's territory, but unlike pro-crypto Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, Hertz-Shargel doesn't think that additional demand is a good thing.""The analogy I like to use is that if you start smoking two packs a day and then cut back to one pack on holidays, that doesn't make smoking good for your health,"" he says.Hertz-Shargel argues that ERCOT should be focused on grid improvements to make it easier to get power from solar and wind farms to big consumption centers, and that bitcoin miners aren't the right way to deal with demand fluctuations. Instead, he argues, ""the intermittency of renewables should be met with demand response from societally-beneficial loads, like industrial facilities, commercial buildings, and residential air conditioners — or energy storage.""But ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones thinks bitcoin miners can be helpful.Jones has been touring the state and hosting public events to answer questions from Texans about the electric grid. Besides winter weather, the impact of cryptocurrency mining on the grid is a common question.""I'm pro bitcoin...but I'm too risk averse to be an investor in bitcoin,"" Jones told a crowd of residents in Frisco, Texas in December. The ERCOT chief went on to explain the mutually beneficial relationship between the grid and bitcoin miners.""A lot of these solar and wind can produce power down to a negative power range, negative $23 per megawatt hour,"" Jones said. ""These bitcoins see that as a great opportunity. They can get paid to use power. And that's why they're coming to the state. But that's not necessarily bad.""Jones makes the point that negative power isn't healthy for the market. Bitcoin miners ""soak up"" some of that negative power, and when the cost of electricity gets slightly higher than what they're willing to pay for it (around $100, according to Jones), they shut off.""So I think it's really a valuable potential resource for us.""

2022-02-03,"India's proposed tax rate on income from virtual assets is steep, but it signals that the government recognizes the country's cryptocurrency industry, the CEO of crypto exchange CoinSwitch told CNBC.In the Feb. 1 annual budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a 30% tax on any income from the transfer of digital assets and said no deductions would be allowed. Losses incurred from such transactions could not be set off against any other income. India also planned to impose a 1% tax deducted at source, or TDS, on payments related to the transfer of digital assets.  India's proposed tax rate on income from virtual assets is steep, but it signals that the government recognizes the country's cryptocurrency industry, the head of a top crypto exchange told CNBC.In the Feb. 1 annual budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman noted in her speech the ""phenomenal increase in transactions in virtual digital assets."" She proposed a 30% tax on any income from the transfer of digital assets and said no deductions would be allowed. Losses incurred from such transactions could not be set off against any other income.Furthermore, India planned to impose a 1% tax deducted at source, or TDS, on payments related to the transfer of digital assets.Ashish Singhal, founder and CEO of CoinSwitch, told CNBC on Thursday that the 30% levy was a bit much. He said, however, it was still an overall positive move as it removes some of the ambiguity around the Indian government's stance on crypto seen in recent months.""What this signals is that government recognizes this industry and hopefully the crypto bill would address the legality of this ecosystem as well,"" Singhal said on ""Street Signs Asia.""He explained that the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council — the industry body in India — would aim to work with the authorities to make the tax for crypto earnings on par with other asset classes over time. Last November, a parliamentary bulletin indicated that the government planned to introduce a new bill aimed at regulating digital currencies. That bulletin said India sought to ban most private cryptocurrencies and establish a framework for a central bank-issued official digital currency.Since then, local media reports have said that the Indian government may decide to regulate the crypto industry instead of imposing a blanket ban.The proposed bill has not yet been introduced. It was not listed among the proposed legislation that may come up before Parliament in the current session, according to media reports.Singhal said that the proposed tax on digital assets provided clarity to the industry on the government's thinking, but noted the steep rate would likely deter some users who saw virtual currencies as a ""quick-rich"" scheme.""What the government has done very smartly is to separate the currency use case of crypto to the asset class use case of crypto,"" he said, adding that the former would be handled by the Reserve Bank of India.""And then, they have recognized crypto assets as an asset class in itself. So that is a big move in my opinion in legitimizing the asset-class use case, the investment use case of crypto,"" Singhal said.In her budget speech, Sitharaman proposed that the central bank would start issuing digital rupee, using ""blockchain and other technologies,"" in the upcoming fiscal year that begins on April 1.When that happens, India would become the latest country to join the trend where central banks in other nations are exploring so-called central bank digital currencies. CBDCs are legal tender in digital form and are essentially the online version of their respective fiat currencies.The digital rupee ""will give a big boost to digital economy,"" Sitharaman said, adding, ""Digital currency will also lead to a more efficient and cheaper currency management system.""RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das told CNBC last year that the central bank had been studying various aspects of a digital currency including its security, impact on India's financial sector as well as how it would affect monetary policy and currency in circulation."
2022-02-04,"SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and his staff have been very busy lately, and they are about to get busier.The Securities and Exchange Commission has roughly 50 proposed rule changes it is considering, and a handful that are in a final regulatory stage and could be adopted soon.""This is one of the largest regulatory agendas we have seen from the SEC in many years,"" Amy Lynch, president of Frontline Compliance and a former SEC compliance official, told me.""There are a lot of items on the list.  They are going to have to pick and choose"" which one to prioritize, Lynch said. While the list of proposed rules changes is large, they can be loosely grouped into several ""buckets"":  proposals of an environmental, social and government (ESG) type; buybacks; insider trading and executive compensation; trading activities; and investor protection.Those hot button issues include proposed rules on so-called ESG, a subgroup that has become a popular investment theme.Proposed ESG-type rules include:Climate change:  enhanced disclosures on climate-related risks and opportunities.Board diversity:  disclosure about the diversity of board members and nominees.Human capital management:  additional disclosure on how companies manage their workforce.These proposed rules are being closely watched by Wall Street.  Dozens of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now offer what they claim are ESG-focused investments.David Franasiak, an attorney at Williams & Jensen who tracks Washington legal developments, noted that the ESG community would be delighted to get their hands on additional information on what corporate America is doing to address issues in this new investment area.""They want usable metrics to update their models and provide new products,"" Franasiak told me.  ""These ESG funds are wildly popular.""Still, it's not clear how popular the ESG funds are at the SEC.  Gensler has also said he would like companies and investment advisors to disclose what criteria they are using to define what constitutes an ESG-type investment. Gensler and his staff have also made it clear they want to know more about how corporate America is spending its profits, how executives are compensated, and how those executives buy and sell their shares. There are proposed rules on:Buybacks:  more disclosure on share repurchases.Insider trading:  Gensler seems concerned that corporate executives are skirting around rules that require disclosure about their stock sales and trades.  He wants more disclosure around Rule 10b5-1, which provides a ""safe harbor"" defense to insider trading for executives that have access to material nonpublic information.Executive compensation:  Gensler is re-proposing implementing guidelines that were first proposed after passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 that would prohibit incentive-based payment arrangement and require disclosure of any such arrangements. Those rules were never implemented. The SEC also wants to know much more about trading activity, including who is shorting stock, and the loaning or borrowing of stock.Short sale disclosure: Gensler would consider mandating monthly disclosure of short sales. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the SEC create rules for the monthly disclosure of short sales, which was never implemented.Loan or borrowing of securities: This change would require lenders of securities to disclose details of the lending transactions and make them available to the public, another mandate from Dodd Frank that was never implemented.SPACs:  The SEC wants to know a lot more about special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), likely including fees and the potential conflict of interest between sponsors and investors. Gensler has taken a particular interest in the Gamestop/Reddit saga.  The SEC is proposing new rules on market structure relating to order routing, conflicts of interest, best execution, market concentration and the disclosure of best-execution statistics. Gensler has expressed concerns about several aspects of the U.S. trading system, specifically gamification of trading (trading with game-like features such as points, rewards, leaderboards, bonuses and competitions to increase engagement). He also has spoken out about payment for order flow (PFOF), in which brokers send their orders to market makers in exchange for payments. This enables some brokers to charge zero commissions.  Gensler has said this may result in a conflict of interest for brokers.Industry participants have been urging Gensler to be careful.""You need to be very deliberate on that approach,"" Ken Bentsen, president and CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), told me.""We have been calling for a review of market structure for some time, but let's be careful not to try to fix things that may not be broken.  The retail investor is getting a better deal than they ever have."" While there are no explicit proposals on cryptocurrency, Gensler and his staff will be very active deciding what comes under their jurisdiction. The SEC chairman has refused to approve a pure-play bitcoin ETF on the grounds bitcoin is subject to fraud and manipulation, and has also made it clear he believes Congress should clarify the regulatory regime around the crypto space.  But Congress is unlikely to pass any legislation. ""In the absence of new regulation, Gensler can continue to define what is a registered security, which will determine whether the SEC has jurisdiction over coins, crypto exchanges or other parts of the crypto universe."" Thomas Gorman, an attorney with Dorsey Whitney who held key positions at the SEC for many years, told me.  He noted the SEC will likely claim that certain crypto investments and platforms meet the definition of a security under existing law and will seek to force them to register with the SEC. How does the SEC get to change the rules?  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, the SEC and all federal agencies must follow a series of procedures in order to implement or change an existing rule.  A majority of the SEC commissioners (there are five members when fully staffed) must propose a rule, then ask for comments from the public (minimum of 30 days response time).  The SEC can then respond to comments, ask for additional comments or propose a final rule.  The final rule can then be voted on and adopted.The majority of the rule changes being considered are still in the proposed rule stage.Getting to that final vote is not always easy, Lynch explains.""There has to be agreement in the division responsible for that rule with the SEC commissioners, which can be a very political process,"" she told me.  ""The key is, whether the proposal is on the minds of the majority.""And if it is not on the minds of the majority?  ""The commissioners may decide not to vote on it, in which case it dies on someone's desk,"" she said. At the heart of many of Gensler's proposed rules is disclosure,  lots of it.Few argue against disclosure, but the issue revolves around how much is necessary and how it is used.""The point of disclosure is, do people have enough information to make an informed decision?"" one SEC watcher, who asked to remain anonymous, told me.  Referring to the PFOF controversy, this source told me, ""The point is not to regulate the pricing of the products. If there are hidden fees, they should be disclosed, but the point should not be, 'You guys are making too much money, and we should do disclosure so you can make less money.""  With an agenda this big, SEC watchers are openly wondering how much Gensler can realistically accomplish.""The real theme from Gensler so far is, 'I will look at this, I'll tell the staff to study it, and I'll think about it,"" Gorman told me.  ""The bottom line is, he's not promising you he's going to do this.  At the end of the day, he's going to take a small number of topics, and likely we will see more disclosures, but it's unlikely he's going to implement dramatic changes.""Gorman particularly expressed doubt that the SEC would get rules passed on the ESG-type proposals.""I'd be surprised to see them move on the ESG-type proposals,"" he told me.  ""Rules on the environment will be very controversial.  For the SEC to wade into that, they would get a firestorm of opposition from the corporate world.""The hostility Gensler has shown toward PFOF is also controversial.Many observers believe that despite the rhetoric, Gensler is unlikely to attempt an all-out ban on PFOF, since it would not only affect market makers who execute orders on behalf of brokers, it would also threaten the business models of both the NYSE and Nasdaq, which also rely on similar payment for order flow arrangements, known as rebates.Once again, more disclosure is the likely outcome.""At the end of the day, we are going to have enhanced disclosure, and even more information for retail investors to make better informed decisions,"" Andrew Smith, head of investor relations at market maker Virtu, told me.Gensler himself has been cagey on the subject of his priorities.  In a speech to the Exchequer Club last month, he was vague on the process of deciding what and when the SEC will vote on in 2022, saying the process was ""intentionally flexible; it's about getting proposals right, based upon the economic analysis and our legal authorities, and learning from public feedback.""""This is a multiyear project,"" he told Bloomberg in a recent interview. ""We don't want to rush things, we want to get it right."" The SEC will hold a meeting next Wednesday, when it is expected there will be new proposals on cybersecurity disclosure and risk management, shortening the settlement time for stock trading (currently investors must settle transactions in two days, known as T+2), and more disclosure for private funds.Considering that under the Trump administration there was a general hostility toward expanding regulations, SEC watchers are marveling at the turnaround.""I think he [Gensler] wants to make the biggest dent he can,"" Amy Lynch told me."

The IRS has warned about ""challenges"" this tax season, and a slew of automated notices are already causing distress for filers.Some taxpayers who sent last year's return and paid their balance have received a CP80 notice saying they may lose their credit for payment if they don't file their 2020 tax return.However, the agency said many of these notices are because of their backlog of unprocessed returns.""We have already decided to suspend notices in situations where we have credited taxpayers for payments but have no record of the tax return being filed,"" the IRS said in a statement.

2022-02-06,"Didi Taihuttu, patriarch of the so-called ""Bitcoin Family,"" says the family is setting down roots in Portugal, Europe's ultimate crypto tax haven.The Dutch family of five has spent the last five years traveling to 40 different countries.The Taihuttus chose Portugal for its advantageous crypto tax rules, which include a 0% tax on bitcoin. Didi Taihuttu, patriarch of the so-called ""Bitcoin Family,"" says the family is setting down roots in Portugal, Europe's ultimate crypto tax haven.Settling down is a big deal for the Dutch family of five, who have traveled the world for the last five years. But after they spent time in 40 countries, Portugal — which is one of the last places in Europe with a 0% tax on bitcoin — was just too enticing a destination to ignore.""You don't pay any capital gains tax or anything else in Portugal on cryptocurrency,"" said Taihuttu. As long as you don't earn cryptocurrency for providing services in Portugal, you're in the clear.""That's a very beautiful bitcoin heaven,"" he said.In 2017, Taihuttu, his wife and three kids liquidated all they owned, trading a 2,500-square-foot house and virtually all their earthly possessions for bitcoin and a life on the road. This was back when the price of bitcoin was around $900. The world's biggest cryptocurrency is currently trading around $41,000 after peaking at about $69,000 in November.The Taihuttu contingent won't disclose the exact size of their crypto nest egg. But Taihuttu says he safeguards the family's crypto fortune in secret vaults on four different continents, so presumably their crypto stake is substantial enough to make it worth having to fly across the globe to redeem their decentralized cash.With that kind of crypto stake, the tax perks in Portugal are certainly a big draw, though it doesn't hurt that the country offers a safe and pleasant way of life. In 2021, the country ranked fourth on the Global Peace Index, and it tops the list of best countries for expats.The Bitcoin Family isn't alone in making the move to the Iberian Peninsula. The 2021 population census in Portugal shows that the number of foreign residents increased by 40% in the last decade.Taihuttu's siblings may also make the move. His brother and sister are selling their houses and investing that cash into bitcoin.""We will all be traveling together as one big bitcoin family which is, of course, really cool,"" said Taihuttu, 43. Unlike the U.S., which treats virtual currency as property, taxing it in a manner similar to stocks or real property, Portugal views cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. That distinction is a game-changer with respect to taxes.""Capital gains resulting from crypto transactions such as cashing out and crypto-to-crypto trades are not subject to personal income taxes,"" explained Shehan Chandrasekera, a CPA and head of tax strategy at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.io.This means that gains from buying or selling cryptocurrency, as with other fiat currencies, are not taxed. It also means that crypto transactions or payments, as well as the exchange of bitcoin for fiat money, are not subject to a value-added tax, or VAT.""This makes Portugal a really attractive place for crypto users to live,"" Chandrasekera said.The only exception to the country's generous crypto scheme relates to companies registered in Portugal that deal in crypto. These businesses face some taxes under certain circumstances.""If you earn cryptocurrency by providing services in Portugal, you need to pay tax on those cryptocurrencies, but I don't earn anything, at the moment, in Portugal. So for me, it's 0% tax,"" said Taihuttu. Taihuttu says the process of establishing residency for the family was relatively smooth and didn't require jumping through very many hoops.For example, even though they don't own any property, the Taihuttus are still considered official residents of Portugal. And unlike other crypto tax havens, such as Puerto Rico, they aren't required to spend a certain number of days there.""We don't need to be there, and that's the beautiful part. There's no minimum requirement of staying a day in Portugal, so it's an easy setup,"" said Taihuttu, who was based in the Netherlands with his family before they began a life on the road.Citizens of the European Union have the right to permanent residence in Portugal, and for non-EU citizens, Portugal offers expats a few paths to residency, including the golden visa and the D7 Visa (also known as the retirement visa or passive income visa), both of which tend to attract wealthy foreigners.The Portuguese golden visa is given to those who buy property, and/or invest a certain amount of money in the country. There are also steps that involve getting a tax identification number, opening a bank account, and formally applying for residency. Companies such as Plan B Passport streamline the application process for expats.CEO Katie Ananina tells CNBC the company has helped hundreds of people from countries such as the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada obtain a second passport in one of seven countries, including Portugal. Plan B Passport works in tandem with each government's residence- or citizenship-by-investment programs.""It's basically a donation into the sustainable growth fund of the country,"" said Ananina. ""So, clients make a $100,000 or $150,000 donation, plus some due diligence fees, government fees, and then $20,000 for my legal fees."" Moving to Portugal for the tax-free crypto life isn't so simple for Americans. ""If a taxpayer has a green card, is a U.S. citizen, or is a U.S. resident alien, the taxpayer owes U.S. tax on any crypto gains they have no matter where the crypto or the taxpayer is located,"" explained Jon Feldhammer, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former IRS senior litigator.""It also doesn't matter if they are dual citizens; if they are U.S. citizens, they owe U.S. tax on their worldwide income,"" Feldhammer said.

One of the island's tax breaks under Act 60, known as the Individual Investors Act, drops that tax obligation down to zero if certain qualifications are met. This is especially significant for entrepreneurs and crypto traders.There is also a major tax incentive for business owners to set down roots in Puerto Rico.Mainland companies are subject to a 21% federal corporate tax, plus a state tax, which varies. If a firm exports its services out of Puerto Rico, to the U.S. or really, anywhere else, they pay a 4% corporate tax rate.  Wout Deley — who has been researching cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology since 2013 — was working as an international sales manager for a galvanization company in Ghent, Belgium, when he decided to sell his house, invest in tokens and then hit the road.After a few months traveling through Europe during the early days of the Covid pandemic, he ultimately settled down in Portugal.Similar to the Taihuttus, Deley sold his house, invested two-thirds of the money in cryptocurrency and then lived off the final third.""At any given time, I have maybe — at a maximum — 10,000 euros ($11,450) in my bank account,"" said Deley. ""All the rest is always in crypto.""For Deley, establishing residency in Portugal was a no-brainer.""Cryptocurrencies in Belgium are massively taxed, and I was looking at seven figures of profit,"" said Deley, who said that he would have faced a tax obligation of close to 40% had he remained in Belgium.""You want to double your profit? Just move to Portugal,"" he said. Deley is in Lagos, which is located in the southwest tip of Portugal. He says that he found a villa available as a long-term rental which was ""very cheap,"" and that was enough to establish residency.The living is easy in Portugal, according to Deley, who says the Algarve offers the perks of Los Angeles — a warm climate and great surf — but without the traffic jams. There is also a solid social scene.""It's full of expats. It's just paradise,"" continued Deley. He says that he knows of at least three bitcoin billionaires who live nearby — plus another 12 people at least, mostly from the U.K., who are moving to Portugal in the next few months for the crypto tax benefits.Deley doesn't speak Portuguese, but he says that's not a problem, because everyone speaks English. He is also surrounded by a lot of like-minded crypto investors.""Everyone has cryptocurrency here. Everyone knows bitcoin. Everyone has it,"" he said.Deley says the crypto investor migration is good for Portugal, too.""They have a huge brain drain. Younger people are leaving. So they're trying to be more open to people with capital, digital nomads,"" said Deley.Meanwhile, the Taihuttus tell CNBC they want to disrupt the typical expat experience in Portugal by building their own crypto village. The family is currently shopping for real estate. They've narrowed their options down to three different plots of land, one as big as 250,000 acres, along the country's southern coastline in the Algarve.The plan is to run the community in a decentralized fashion, in which the land is divvied up by the square meter and sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, in order to signify ownership.Taihuttu also wants to mine for bitcoin with solar and wind power and then use the heat produced by the rigs to warm houses in the winter, in a sort of closed-loop system.The working plan, for now, is to use a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, to govern the community. DAOs run on blockchain technology.""We want to build a decentralized lifestyle, which is the future,"" he said."
2022-02-06,"February started on a dramatic note as Big Tech companies, including Meta Platforms and Amazon, issued quarterly earnings and swayed the major averages. Though the near-term turbulence is enough to rattle most investors, it takes a long-term perspective to look through the dramatic swings in share prices. To that effect, top analysts are highlighting the companies they believe have long-term potential, according to TipRanks, which tracks the best-performing stock pickers.related investing news Battleground stocks: These are the stocks analysts are most divided onHakyung KimNick Wells9 hours agoBuy this under-the-radar chip stock, which can see upside of more than 20%, Jefferies saysBrian Evans11 hours agoBuy this resilient regional bank trading at a 50% discount, Bank of America saysMichelle Fox14 hours agoHere are five stocks Wall Street analysts find compelling. Tumult in tech shares isn't the only thing giving investors indigestion. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency have experienced sharp moves – and shares of the companies that mine the flagship crypto have also suffered.One company is starting to look like an attractive purchase, according to Jonathan Petersen of Jefferies: Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA). Marathon's strong ties to bitcoin's spot price has subjected its shares to volatility. However, instead of stepping back, the company has invested in even more mining infrastructure and is currently on track to control the largest market share of its industry. (See Marathon Digital Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks) Petersen expects this milestone to materialize this year. He calculates that Marathon Digital holds about 1.9% of the total mining market, and he anticipates this number to rise above 5% once its new hardware is deployed.  After calculating MARA's potential for growth, the analyst views ""the miners as a better investment than BTC."" Petersen rated the stock a buy and assigned a price target of $51.  The analyst noted that MARA has made more deposits for its miners than any of its competition. Additionally, the firm has been using third-party data centers to ramp up its deployment processes. Petersen wrote that ""MARA's strategy for future growth of using data center hosting providers sets the company apart from some of its largest peers.""  This method provides for lower operating costs in the near-term, but it may pose as an issue years down the line when margins shrink after bitcoin's 2024 halving. A bitcoin halving event cuts in half the reward for mining the cryptocurrency, and it cuts the rate at which new bitcoins go into circulation. It happens about every four years.Out of more than 7,000 analysts, Petersen is rated as No. 290. His success rate stands at an impressive 72% and has returned an average of 20.8% on his stock picks.   Another name which has come down considerably from its November highs is Roblox (RBLX), which was dragged into tech and growth's downfall over the last two months. The stock had benefited handsomely from Meta Platform's (FB) pivot toward the metaverse, and it appears its share price was no longer sustainable.  Despite the rotation, the video game developer is still expected to play a strong part in nascent metaverse opportunities. The stock has fallen more than 50% from its mid-November peak. (See Roblox Stock Charts on TipRanks) Drew Crum of Stifel noted that Roblox has ""demonstrated both annual and sequential gains."" He said the firm has ranked as third globally against other popular gaming platforms in December 2021.  Crum rated the stock a buy and denoted a price target of $110.  The analyst was encouraged by RBLX's progress in regard to its relevance among its peers across both iOS and Xbox systems, as well as its robust organic growth in bookings revenues.  Crum believes that ""Roblox represents a compelling play on the convergence of content and social, two 'viral loops' that provide a mutually reinforcing network effect, and together should drive high engagement, and hence monetization across its platform."" On TipRanks, Crum maintains a ranking of No. 121 out of over 7,000 financial analysts. When picking stocks, he has been correct 69% of the time and has returned an average of 39.3% on his ratings.   Boeing (BA) has been plagued by its 737 Max saga, a story which saw its new aircraft grounded across the globe. However, many countries have since recertified it, and Boeing has begun to see new orders come in for other aircraft.  Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Markets noted that most recently Qatar Airways placed an order for 34 new 777X cargo aircraft, with an option for 16 more. (See Boeing Risk Factors on TipRanks) Herbert rated the stock a buy and calculated a price target of $265 per share.  Regarding a possible industrywide rebound, the analyst noted that he expects ""continued strength in order activity to support a positive view of the aerospace fundamentals."" Moreover, as consumer spending trends continue to boost e-commerce activity and shipping costs remain elevated, airlines are shifting focus to cargo operations.  This strategy comes as leisure and corporate travel have sustained persisting impacts, and airlines have been sent looking to offset losses. Additionally, the new fuel-efficient 777X cargo jets are particularly attractive at a time when oil commodity prices remain at sky-high levels.  TipRanks calculates Herbert at No. 214 out of more than 7,000 professional analysts. He has been successful picking stocks 64% of the time and has returned an average of 27.3% on each of them.   Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) just beat Wall Street consensus estimates on its earnings report and provided a ""spectacular March guidance,"" according to Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna. (See Advanced Micro Devices Earnings Data on TipRanks) The analyst rated the stock a buy and raised his price target to $180 from $175.  Explaining that AMD has strength across all of its businesses, Rolland remained bullish on the company's outlook. He noted that robust shipments were observed in its DC GPU segment, and its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) segment saw profitability soar. The latter outperformed tremendously, with fourth-quarter profits nearly doubling what was generated in all of 2020.  Rolland added that the acquisition of Xilinx, a programmable logic semiconductor firm, is expected to close over the next two weeks. AMD is also in the process of ramping up production of its Milan-X processor, with its Genoa and Bergamo chips anticipated to aid its product cycle by the second half of the year.  Rolland concluded by mentioning that AMD has repurchased about $1 billion in stock and that ""we recommend investors do the same.""  Out of more than 7,000 expert analysts, TipRanks maintains Rolland at No. 4. His stock ratings have turned correct 86% of the time and have averaged returns of 53.4%.   Block's (SQ) valuation skyrocketed as consumers gravitated toward using contactless and app-based payment systems. However, with trends decelerating over the last quarter coupled with a sell-off in tech and growth, SQ shares are down about 62% from their high last August.The fintech ""super-app"" company recently closed its acquisition of ""buy now, pay later"" firm Afterpay, and Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan is bullish on the possibilities. He is confident the company's integration will be put to use monetizing and boosting gross profits, and it fits neatly in between Block's seller and Cash App ecosystems.  Huang rated the stock a buy and assigned a price target of $200.  The analyst said the stock is currently trading at an attractive discount in relation to its super-app peers, especially when considering its ""large and untapped addressable market, unique growth characteristics, and an equally unique mission and corporate culture,"" which all justify his rating. (See Block Website Traffic on TipRanks) Huang is bullish on Afterpay's capacities, stating that allowing sellers to offer payment installments to their customers is ""just the beginning."" He expects the two-sided network to accelerate Cash App's engagement, user acquisition on Cash Card, and Block's international presence overall.  Huang is ranked as No. 238 out of over 7,000 financial analysts in TipRanks' database. Of his stock picks, 66% of them have been successful, and they have returned him an average of 31.8% per.  "

2022-02-07,"Sequoia Capital India led a $450 million investment in Polygon, a blockchain network that serves as a support layer to Ethereum.Polygon eventually wants to become a decentralized version of Amazon Web Services. It's part of a movement in crypto known as ""Web3.""Hype around Web3 has attracted some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global. Sequoia Capital is playing catchup with arch-rival Andreessen Horowitz in the race to invest in what could be the future of the internet — so-called Web3.The Silicon Valley venture capital firm led a $450 million investment in Polygon, a blockchain network.Blockchains are the distributed logs of transactions that underpin many of the world's major digital currencies. They are maintained by a network of computers, which have to reach consensus across the whole system to confirm transactions and mint new units of currency.Polygon serves as a support layer to Ethereum, the platform behind the ether cryptocurrency, helping it process transactions at scale.The Ethereum network is different from bitcoin's in that it supports applications for things like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) services, not just peer-to-peer transfers. Over the years, the Ethereum blockchain has become congested as more and more users have piled in, resulting in slower transaction times and higher processing fees. This has led to the creation of so-called ""Layer 2"" network like Polygon, which aim to take a load off the main blockchain.Polygon sits on top of the Ethereum network as a proof-of-stake blockchain. Whereas Ethereum uses power-intensive crypto mining to verify transactions, participants in Polygon's network just need to show they hold some tokens — in other words, a ""stake"" — to become validators. The result is much faster transaction times — in the thousands per second, according to Polygon. In comparison, Ethereum's network can handle about 15 transactions per second. Polygon says it's completed over a billion transactions to date and has around 2.7 million monthly active users.Ethereum is embarking on an upgrade, called Ethereum 2.0, that would make it faster and more efficient. The upgrade still has a way to go before becoming reality, but some experts fear it poses a threat to Polygon. For its part, Polygon says it expects demand for blockchain scaling services to remain strong even after Ethereum 2.0 is implemented.Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal says he sees the company becoming a decentralized version of Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant's cloud computing arm. Polygon's grander ambitions form part of a movement in the crypto world known as ""Web3."" Web3 is a hazy concept in tech that refers to efforts to build a more decentralized version of the internet based on blockchain technology.It's generated quite a bit of chatter in Silicon Valley. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has criticized it as a ""centralized entity"" controlled by venture capitalists, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk said it seems like more of a ""marketing buzzword"" than reality.

Whereas companies like Facebook or Twitter control their own computations, Web3 promises ""transparency"" around those processes, Nailwal said.Polygon wants to be the platform for big brands to develop their own Web3 strategies. It's already got companies like Adidas and Prada experimenting with NFTs on its network. Nailwal says not all corporations are sold on crypto yet, but NFTs have been easier for them to digest. Hype around Web3 has attracted some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global and Sequoia.So far, Sequoia has stayed relatively quiet about its interest in crypto, while Andreessen has its own dedicated fund for investing in the sector. Now, Sequoia is becoming more vocal.""Thousands of developers across a range of applications are choosing Polygon and their complete set of scaling solutions for the Ethereum ecosystem,"" said Shailesh Lakhani, managing director of Sequoia India. ""This is an ambitious and aggressive team, one that values innovation at its core.""Like Ethereum and other blockchains, Polygon has its own token, called matic. Rather than issuing new shares, the company sold units of token to investors in a private round. Polygon's backers are making a bet that matic will go up in value as adoption of its network increases. The funds came from Sequoia's India unit, with SoftBank, Galaxy Digital and Tiger Global also investing.It echoes a similar deal involving Solana Labs, the start-up behind Ethereum-rival Solana, which raised $314 million in a private token sale backed by Andreessen Horowitz.Polygon plans to allocate $100 million of the funding to an ""ecosystem fund"" supporting the development of new projects on its network. The rest will serve as  ""buffer money"" to help Polygon's 240-person team continue building out the platform in the years to come. The company is also making a push into gaming, having recently hired former YouTube executive Ryan Wyatt as head of its game studio.""You're seeing a lot of really great developers leaving major established studios to come create blockchain games,"" Wyatt told CNBC. ""We're going to open up a whole new type of gaming experience with the people that are developing games on the blockchain.""""Over the next two or three years, we're going to point to examples of high-polish, triple-A games that are built on Polygon,"" he added.Polygon says it is now valued at $2 billion.The group doesn't consider itself as a company in the traditional sense.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday morning it seized more than $3.6 billion in allegedly stolen cryptocurrency linked to the 2016 hack of Bitfinex. As part of the operation, authorities detained a New York couple on allegations they planned to launder the digital goods.It marks the agency's largest financial seizure ever, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.Officials said they arrested Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31.

2022-02-08,"Recent research finds that 24% of cryptocurrency owners are Hispanic, versus 16% of all U.S. adults.One explanation for that high adoption is those users may be more likely to turn to cryptocurrencies for payments rather than for investments.""There are communities out there that need better ways to pay,"" one researcher says. The stereotypical cryptocurrency owner is a high-earning white male. However, research finds that other demographics — particularly minorities — are also turning to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.A recent survey conducted by Morning Consult found that while 69% of all U.S. adults are white, only 62% of cryptocurrency owners are.Meanwhile, 24% of cryptocurrency owners are Hispanic, while just 16% of U.S. adults overall identify as Hispanic.Other minorities comprise a smaller share of crypto owners, with Blacks owning 8% and Asians and other ethnicities 6%.  Crypto owners are also overwhelmingly male, with 70%, versus 30% female.""The majority of crypto owners are white, but they're also disproportionately Hispanic,"" said Charlotte Principato, financial services analyst at Morning Consult.Separate research from the Pew Research Center recently found that Asian, Black and Hispanic adults are more likely than white adults to have invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency.One explanation for the high adoption rate among Hispanics is that they are not only more likely to own cryptocurrency as an asset in their investment portfolio, but also as a means for paying for things compared to white cryptocurrency owners, Principato said.More from Personal Finance:How to answer the 'virtual currency' question on your tax return Why advisors say you should have cryptocurrency in your portfolioWhat happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to the IRS""There are communities out there that need better ways to pay,"" Principato said. ""And that is one of cryptocurrency's big promises, especially for bitcoin.""Another reason may be that cryptocurrency is booming in Latin America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Mexico, where inflation is higher than the U.S. That could inspire use by U.S. Hispanics who want to send money to those countries or who are just influenced by the enthusiasm, Principato said.Bitwage, a provider of cryptocurrency payroll invoicing and benefit services, has seen its Latin American business grow dramatically in the past couple of years, particularly in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, according to CEO Jonathan Chester.Workers in the U.S. can sign up and choose to receive their pay in stablecoin or bitcoin and have it go directly to a wallet they own, bypassing a traditional bank account, Chester said.  Those services have the potential to help underserved markets, such as Hispanic workers who want to have some of their salaries automatically sent home to their families in other countries. If Bitwage were to put those kinds of services in place, it could offer minimal fees compared to other more traditional money transfers, Chester said.Morning Consult's research found that cryptocurrency owners were more likely to use alternative financial services, including purchasing a money order, taking out a payday advance or payday loan through businesses other than a bank or credit union.""These are the folks who know how to get what they need done,"" Principato said.Because the transactions they choose may be more expensive or inconvenient at times, it makes sense that they're open to using cryptocurrency. ""They're looking for better ways to pay,"" Principato said.

2022-02-08,"As tensions rise with Russia, new data shows that Ukrainian volunteer groups are crowdfunding bitcoin to support the country's military.Cryptocurrency donations totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars have been made to Ukrainian NGOs and volunteer groups, according to a report from Elliptic, which sells blockchain analytics tools.The crypto raised by Ukrainian activists has been deployed for a variety of purposes, including equipping the Ukrainian army with military gear, medical supplies and drones. As more than 100,000 Russian troops mass on the border with Ukraine — and global powers work to stave off all-out war between the two countries — new data shows that Ukrainians are crowdfunding bitcoin to fight back.Donations totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars have flooded into Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations and volunteer groups, according to a report from Elliptic, which sells blockchain analytics tools to banks and some of the world's largest cryptocurrency platforms, including Binance and Circle. Activists have deployed the crypto for a variety of purposes, including equipping the Ukrainian army with military equipment, medical supplies and drones, as well as funding the development of a facial recognition app that identifies if someone is a Russian mercenary or spy.""Cryptocurrency is increasingly being used to crowdfund war, with the tacit approval of governments,"" said Tom Robinson, Elliptic's chief scientist.Although Russia says it has no plan to mount an offensive, the U.S., U.K. and others have preemptively sent military hardware to Ukraine to help brace for a possible invasion. For years, volunteer groups have augmented the work of Ukraine's military by offering additional resources and manpower. When Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in 2014, for example, legions of organized volunteers stepped up to support protesters.Typically, these organizations receive funds from private donors via bank wires or payment apps, but cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have become more popular since they allow them to bypass financial institutions that might block payments to Ukraine.""Cryptocurrency is particularly suited to international fundraising because it doesn't respect national boundaries and it's censorship-resistant — there is no central authority that can block transactions, for example in response to sanctions,"" said Elliptic's Robinson.""The advantage of raising funds in crypto is that it's a lot harder to confiscate them,"" said Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst, who has advised charities in authoritarian countries, including former East bloc nations, on raising funds.Volunteer groups and NGOs have collectively raised just over $570,000 in cryptocurrency, according to Elliptic's report. Much of that crypto cash was received in the last year. Elliptic's software is sometimes used to investigate criminal activity on bitcoin's digital ledger and monitor transactions to fight money laundering. For this report, Elliptic identified multiple cryptocurrency wallets used by volunteer organizations across Ukraine, in order to trace where and how crypto funds are being put to use.One such group, Come Back Alive, which began accepting cryptocurrency in 2018, provides the military with equipment, training services and medical supplies. The group says they saw bitcoin donations surge to $200,000 in the second half of 2021.Another group, the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, says it raises money exclusively in cryptocurrency. Over the past year, the group has received close to $100,000 in bitcoin, litecoin, ether and a mix of stablecoins. Since 2016, Alliance activists have engaged in cyberattacks against Russian targets, says Elliptic.""Their operations have included attacks on propaganda sites, the Russian Ministry of Defense, and various individuals linked to Russia’s activities in Ukraine. Intelligence collected during these operations is reportedly shared with Ukrainian law enforcement and intelligence agencies,"" according to the report.Kyiv-based NGO Myrotvotrets Center has taken donations in crypto since 2016 and is currently working on a facial recognition app that would be able to identify ""militants, Russian mercenaries, and war criminals"" based on a photograph.The organization — which says donations to its cause have come from more than 40 countries — already publishes information about people considered to be ""enemies of Ukraine.""Thus far, the Myrotvotrets Center says it's raised at least $267,000 through more than 100 bitcoin donations. Ukrainian activists aren't the only ones leaning into crypto.Pro-Russian separatists have been raising funds in bitcoin since the early days of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. Sobrado tells CNBC that some Russian officials mentioned they weren't shutting off opposition bank accounts for ""fear they'd push them into crypto fundraising, which is a lot harder to monitor.""Sobrado went on to say that there is a long history of crypto fundraising for controversial causes, from WikiLeaks to Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who has also been raising funds in bitcoin. For months, Ukraine has taken steps to embrace cryptocurrencies at a national level.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a law in 2021 that paved the way for the country's central bank to issue its own digital currency.The president and parliament are also going back and forth on a law that would legalize and regulate cryptocurrency. If the measure passes, it would go a long way toward elevating crypto out of the legal gray area where it currently sits, though it wouldn't go as far as El Salvador, which adopted bitcoin as legal tender in September.On an official state visit to the U.S. in August 2021, Zelenskyy spoke of Ukraine's budding ""legal innovative market for virtual assets"" as a selling point for investment, and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov said the country was modernizing its payment market so that its national bank would be able to issue digital currency.This year, the country plans to open the cryptocurrency market to businesses and investors, according to the Kyiv Post. Top state officials have also been touting their crypto street cred to investors and venture capital funds in Silicon Valley.A war with Russia, however, could render all those plans moot."
2022-02-09,"Tax credits slash your liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, whereas deductions reduce income subject to tax.The most valuable write-offs are typically above-the-line deductions and refundable tax credits.However, you'll need to run the numbers to see which options are best on your return, financial experts say. If you're eager to slash your tax bill, two popular methods are claiming credits and deductions on your return. While both can reduce your balance, these write-offs have key differences, which ultimately affect your bottom line.Credits lessen your liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, whereas deductions reduce income subject to tax, said certified financial planner Judson Meinhart, manager of financial planning at Parsec Financial in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.For example, let's say you owe the IRS $5,000 at tax time. In that scenario, a $2,000 tax credit drops your bill to $3,000.   However, the value of a deduction depends on your marginal taxes. If you're in the 24% bracket, for example, a $2,000 deduction is worth $480 — your tax rate multiplied by the write-off. ""If you can take either a deduction or credit for the same expense, do the math to see which offers the better result,"" said David Flamer, a CPA at the firm in his name in Agoura Hills, California. ""Otherwise, there could be taxes left on the table.""Here's how tax credits and deductions work on your tax return.You start with gross earnings and subtract so-called ""above-the-line"" deductions for your adjusted gross income, or AGI.  More from Advice and the Advisor:What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated These deductions are unique because you can claim them regardless of whether you take the standard deduction or itemize, Flamer said.Some of the most common above-the-line deductions are retirement contributions, student loan interest and health savings account deposits, with some having phase-outs by income level. Next, you reduce AGI by either the standard deduction or itemized ""below-the-line"" deductions, such as mortgage interest, charitable gifts, medical expenses and state and local taxes capped at $10,000. However, you don't claim these write-offs unless the total exceeds $12,550 for individuals and $25,100 for married couples filing jointly in 2021. Starting in 2018, former President Donald Trump's signature tax overhaul nearly doubled the standard deduction, so you're less likely to itemize, Meinhart said.Indeed, almost 90% of taxpayers now take the standard deduction, according to the IRS.After subtracting the standard or itemized deductions from AGI, you reach taxable income, the number used to calculate your bill.But first, you can claim tax credits, subject to income limits, which may zero out your balance or boost your refund. ""Some tax credits are worth more than others,"" Flamer said. Tax credits can be non-refundable, slashing your liability to zero, or refundable, offering a payment beyond what you owe. And partially refundable tax credits offer a combination of the two.For 2021, refundable tax credits may include the earned income tax credit for low- to moderate-income families, the child tax credit, the child and dependent care credit and more. While it's easy to claim tax credits and deductions through filing software, it's important to make sure you're eligible, Flamer said, and it pays to educate yourself about the benefits.The chances of an audit are slim, but certain write-offs are more likely to attract scrutiny from the IRS. Experts suggest keeping a copy of tax receipts for seven years to be safe.  "
2022-02-09,"At 22, I became the youngest full-time female trader on Wall Street, and the second African American woman trader in the New York Stock Exchange's 229-year history.Now, as a 27-year-old entrepreneur and host of the streaming series ""Going Public,"" I'm taking what I learned to help young people have intimate conversations about how to make smart financial decisions.One thing I've noticed is that, in general, most people have poor spending habits and struggle to save money. It may sound intense, but I save 85% of my annual income. This was just something I was taught as a child; if my monthly allowance was $50, then I would only spend $7 to $8 that month.While I realize that everyone's situation may be different, these are the frugal habits that have helped me build wealth and save money: At my first job on Wall Street in 2017, I was making $12,000 per year. Now my annual income has increased by more than 5,000% — mostly through my streaming show and speaking events.So even though I went from making $12,000 to $650,000, I am very clear about my wants versus my needs and still stick to the 85% savings plan. I pay my rent for the entire year up-front. This way, if I run into an unexpected situation that affects my finances, I know I'm covered and don't have to stress about my housing expense.If you can't pay for a full year in advance, try to pay for six months, then start saving for the next six months. If you set a fixed amount of money aside and stick to your budget, you'll be less likely to spend on things you don't need. When I moved from New York City (where public transportation is the norm) to California in 2021, I knew I'd have to buy a car. For environmental reasons, I opted for an electric vehicle instead of a gas car. It ended up making a world of difference for my budget.While the average price per gallon in California is $4.68, I spend less than $30 per month to charge my car. There are so many new electric cars hitting the market, and I recommend looking for one that fits your budget. I'm quite mindful of what I put in my body and how it makes me feel. Opting for healthier food options can be more expensive sometimes, but what I eat has helped me stay focused and energized.That said, I keep a strict grocery budget of $250 per month. To cut down on costs, I don't buy sugary snacks or other expensive and unhealthy items. So rather than paying extra on junk food, I keep fresh fruit around me all day to snack on. I pay for our Hulu family subscription. Meanwhile, one of my family members covers Netflix, and another covers Prime Video.This lets all of us watch our favorite shows without having to hook up a cable box, and is such an easy way to get access to multiple streaming services while saving hundreds of dollars a year. Gym memberships can be great, but also very costly. In New York, it can set you back by up to $3,260 per year.For me, bodyweight exercise that I can do anywhere is my best friend. I've also invested in weights and some other gym equipment, which allow me to work out at home alongside my favorite YouTube workout videos.I also take advantage of hiking and other free, outdoor activities that gets me moving. I love biking, and while I don't own one, there are many rental services that offer the first hour for free. Understanding your risk tolerance can help dictate how you save and invest. I'm conservative with my investing choices, but I balance it with practical risks.For example, one of my savings accounts is worth $10,000 and only grew to $10,053 in two years. That's not ideal, but at least I know I won't lose that investment. Meanwhile, my investment in a higher-risk stock grew from $327 to $5,900 in less than 12 months last year. Since we're still living in a pandemic, I often work from home. But even with increased flexibility, I still need to keep my mental sanity in check. So, I travel.Going on vacation during the off-season helps me save a lot of money. One of my favorite places to travel in the U.S. is Florida. I pay 45% to 65% less on airfare and beachfront rentals in the spring and fall than I would in the summer.

2022-02-09,"After months of resistance, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has greenlighted a plan to ban members of Congress from trading stock, CNBC confirmed Wednesday.At Pelosi's direction, a House committee is drafting the rules, and the legislation is expected to be put up for a vote this year.Several versions of a stock trading ban are also under consideration in the Senate, including one co-authored by progressive Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines. WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders have greenlighted a plan to craft legislation that would prohibit members of Congress from trading stock, after months of resistance to a ban by Pelosi, CNBC confirmed Wednesday.At Pelosi's direction, the House Administration Committee is working on drafting the rules, and the legislation is expected to be put up for a vote this year, likely before the November midterm elections.In the Senate, several versions of a stock trading ban are under consideration, including one co-authored by progressive Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines. ""When you're elected, you're here to serve the people, not the elite, and [a stock trading ban] I think is a step forward, an important step forward, to restore the faith and trust of the American people in this institution,"" Daines told CNBC on Wednesday.Many questions remain about what types of investments would be prohibited, what incoming members would be required to do to comply with a new law, and whether family members of lawmakers would also be banned from trading stocks.Nevertheless, Pelosi's support for a stock trading ban in the House, first reported by Punchbowl News, represents an about-face for the speaker, and comes after years of congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle rejecting the idea of limiting what investments members of Congress can hold.In the past, opponents of a ban on stock trading in Congress have claimed it would hamper efforts to recruit the best candidates to run for office. Meanwhile, many of their own families have grown wealthy by investing in the stock market, including Pelosi's.Yet in recent months, Pelosi and her top lieutenants have come under growing pressure from rank-and-file members to take action and pass a stock trading ban.These increasingly noisy calls for a ban have been spurred in part by growing public support for a prohibition on lawmakers trading stocks. A recent survey commissioned by a conservative advocacy group found that 76% of voters believed that lawmakers and their spouses had an ""unfair advantage"" in the stock market. The same survey, conducted by the Convention of States Action, also found that just 5% of likely voters approved of members of Congress trading stocks.They also reflect the impact of new revelations about how widespread violations are of the current law, the 2012 STOCK Act, which was designed to prevent insider trading and conflicts of interest in Congress.Last year alone, 54 members violated the STOCK Act rules, according to an analysis by Business Insider published earlier this year. The question at the heart of the stock trading issue is whether or not members of Congress have an unfair advantage in the stock market because they are privy to information on a daily basis that is not available to the public.Examples of this kind of information include classified briefings about national security issues, advance knowledge of regulatory actions, and nonpublic details about legislation, appropriations and tax policy. Any one of these could create a conflict of interest for a lawmaker who owned and traded shares in a company that would be impacted by this information.""The intent here is to ensure that members and their spouses are not trading or holding individual stocks and bonds and so forth,"" Daines said Wednesday. ""Listen, you put your assets in a blind trust, you're still aware of what assets were put in that blind trust. That's just the reality of it, and we're trying to reduce the conflicts of interest here.""But as stock trading legislation takes shape in both the House and Senate, members will need to find compromise between a wide range of proposals. Several of the bills proposed so far would require incoming members of Congress to place their stock portfolios in a traditional blind trust, where it would be managed by an independent trustee who could buy and sell the stocks without the member's knowledge.But the bill that Daines and Warren plan to introduce goes significantly further, and prohibits members from even owning stocks. That means newly elected members of Congress would be required to actually sell their stock holdings, regardless of whether or not such a sale would be financially advantageous.Other stock trading ban proposal bills differ on key issues like whether they would apply to members' spouses and children, and what kinds of investments would be allowed.Yet another question up for debate is how violations of any stock trading ban would be handled. Penalties could range from relatively soft ones like a written warning to serious punishments, such as massive fines or a loss of committee assignments.There is also likely to be resistance from members who feel that a stock trading ban denies them a right to participate in free markets, and effectively punishes them for their decision to enter public service.This was the sentiment behind Pelosi's now infamous response in December to a reporter's question about whether she would support a stock trading ban for members of Congress.""We are a free market economy. They should be able to participate in that,"" she replied.But that response quickly backfired, especially given that Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, is a venture capital investor who holds tens of millions of dollars worth of stock. Speaker Pelosi has long insisted that she does not own any stocks herself.

Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, is making a $200 million strategic investment in Forbes, the 104-year-old magazine and digital publisher, CNBC has learned.The funds will help Forbes execute on its plan to merge with a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, in the first quarter, according to people with knowledge of the deal.Investors have grown skeptical of SPAC deals generally, and media deals in particular, in recent months amid the broader stock market retrenchment. Binance will replace half of the $400 million in commitments from institutional investors announced by Forbes in August, said the people, who declined to be identified before the transaction is announced.That would make Binance one of the top two biggest owners of Forbes, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker FRBS, the people said. The crypto company will also get two directors out of nine total board seats, they said.The move shows the increasing real-world influence of the crypto sector, which has seen surging valuations and minted a new class of billionaires amid global interest in digital assets. While crypto companies have gone public, affixed their names to sports arenas and flooded airwaves with celebrity endorsements, this is the sector's first big investment in a traditional U.S. media property.Forbes was founded more than a century ago by the grandfather of editor-in-chief and two-time presidential candidate Steve Forbes. In 2014, Forbes sold a 95% stake to Hong Kong-based Integrated Whale Media at a valuation of $475 million. Known for its flagship magazine and a digital publishing model that relies on contributors, Forbes has worked to diversify its revenue with licensing deals and e-commerce and direct-to-consumer efforts. The company says it reaches 150 million people through its content and events.Forbes is also known for its annual rankings of the world's richest business tycoons.It's a category that Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao joined recently. Last month, the net worth of Zhao, who prefers to go by ""CZ,"" was pegged at $96 billion by Bloomberg News. The figure, a conservative estimate that excludes his personal crypto holdings, makes him easily the industry's richest entrepreneur.

2022-02-10,"Voters and Washington are bitterly divided. But Democrats and Republicans in Congress have found some common ground on crypto, China, lawmakers' stock trading and other issues.Democrats and Republicans could find themselves championing similar legislation as they hit the campaign trail for the midterm elections.But bipartisanship carries dangers for both sides. Democrats risk alienating their liberal base, while Republicans could run afoul of former President Trump and his supporters. Washington and the broader American electorate are sharply divided along partisan lines, but there are still some places where Republicans and Democrats in Congress share common ground.Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis both think Congress needs to step up on cryptocurrency. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, agrees with fellow Californian Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, in wondering whether stock-trading rules for members of Congress could be tightened. And almost all lawmakers in Congress think something ought to be done to bolster U.S. competitiveness with China.In three separate areas — a China-U.S. business bill, regulations on cryptocurrency and revisions to the Electoral Count Act of 1887 — Democrats and Republicans could find themselves championing similar legislation as they hit the campaign trail for the midterm elections this year.The two sides also managed to reach a compromise in November on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which will pour hundreds of billions into roads, bridges and broadband across the country over the next several years. Democrats and Republicans — many of whom voted against the infrastructure legislation — have touted funding for local transportation projects stemming from the law.But such bipartisanship carries risks for both sides.Democrats, who hold narrow majorities in Congress, face an uphill battle this year given President Joe Biden's flagging polling numbers, the historical tendency for the president's party to lose seats in a first-term midterm campaign and the potential for alienating their liberal base by making concessions to Republicans.On the other side of the aisle, Republicans striking deals with Democrats could mean trouble for them in the primaries with former President Donald Trump. The ex-president has a habit of lashing out at members of the GOP whom he deems disloyal, such as former ally and ex-Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Republicans who backed the infrastructure bill.And, like all things in Washington, whether the two parties can unite behind any of these initiatives will depend on minute details. A growing number of Democrats and Republicans are moving toward legislation to bar members of Congress from trading stocks.Several lawmakers, Republican and Democrat, came under fire in 2020 for transactions during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Federal health officials briefed lawmakers on the virus and its potential impact before that intelligence was widely distributed to the public, raising questions whether legislators' subsequent stock trades were tainted.The push to limit lawmakers' stock trading is getting a boost from Democratic bigwigs in the House. Pelosi and Democratic leaders recently OK'd a plan to draft legislation at the Committee on House Administration. Pelosi's support for tighter restrictions on congressional securities trading amounts to a pivot for the House speaker, who has long viewed stricter rules as unnecessary. Whether Pelosi supports greater limitations for spousal trading remains an open question. While the speaker herself does not typically disclose equities trading, her husband Paul Pelosi is an investment manager and frequently reports transactions worth hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of dollars.Pelosi declined to say during her weekly press conference Wednesday morning whether she supports tighter spousal regulations. But the speaker did say she would like to see more aggressive fines for violating the STOCK Act, a 2012 statue that prohibits members of Congress from trading based on nonpublic information for private profit.""We have to tighten the fines on those who violate the STOCK Act. It's obviously not sufficient to deter behavior,"" she said. ""It's a confidence issue. And if that's what the members want to do, then that's what we will do.""

Tim Scott of South Carolina files paperwork to run for presidentG-7 leaders commit to more Russia sanctions with Ukraine's Zelenskyy set to attend summit Meanwhile, several senators are working on versions of a stock-trading ban, including a new effort from Warren, D-Mass., and Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines. Many of the bills proposed so far, including one backed by Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Mark Kelly of Arizona, would require incoming members of Congress to place their stock portfolios in a traditional blind trust.""When you're elected, you're here to serve the people, not the elite, and [a stock trading ban], I think, is a step forward, an important step forward, to restore the faith and trust of the American people in this institution,"" Daines told CNBC on Wednesday.McCarthy, the House minority leader, and other top Republican lawmakers have in recent weeks discussed with donors ways they could campaign on the issue of limiting lawmakers' equity ownership. If there's any subject that unifies the most conservative Republican and the most liberal Democrat, it's a deep skepticism of China and a motivation to ensure U.S. economic competitiveness.Americans' views on China are as frigid as they've ever been, according to survey results released by Gallup last year. Its polling found that some 79% of Americans view Beijing as ""very"" or ""mostly"" unfavorable.That may be part of the reason the Biden administration has retained many of the hardline economic and national security measures first imposed under Trump. Biden, though, has traded his predecessor's openly bellicose language and tit-for-tat tariff exchanges for a more subtle strategy — one that seeks to check Beijing through global alliances and by reducing U.S. reliance on Chinese commerce.One big bipartisan effort that could reach Biden's desk in 2022 is the pending legislation to modernize U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and otherwise bolster competitiveness with the communist superpower.The Senate first passed a $250 billion version of the measure — the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act — in June on a bipartisan basis. That bill was the product of almost every Senate committee with input from a range of Republicans and Democrats, and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., took the lead in guiding it through that chamber. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., cheered the legislation's goals when the bill cleared and said he'd have liked an even-more-pointed piece of legislation.""As a China hawk and a fiscal hawk, I would have liked for this bill to take a more focused and aggressive approach to the China threat – but this is a strong start,"" he said in a statement. ""The Chinese Communist Party is working overtime on cyber, AI, and machine learning so that they can become the world's preeminent superpower.""The House took months to review and pass its own version of the bill, but finally did so on Friday in a $350 billion bill titled the America Competes Act.That measure, however, cleared the House almost entirely along party lines after the chamber's Democrats sought to use proposed changes to trade policy to add protections for U.S. workers. The House bill included language to help remedy racial disparities and inequalities; the Senate draft did not include this language.Still, the versions share similar core ambitions like enhancing domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign sources by reinforcing the U.S. supply chain, Morgan Stanley policy strategist Michael Zezas wrote in early February.Small differences in the two bills have forced lawmakers from each chamber to form a conference committee to reconcile the versions. For example, Senate Republicans may insist the final legislation add bolder language to confront Beijing and strip out proposed contributions to the United Nation's Green Climate Fund.But Zezas remains optimistic that lawmakers will ultimately come to a compromise.""Conditions have long been conducive for enactment of a bill of this kind given the entrenched, bipartisan skepticism of the US-China relationship among voters and policymakers,"" he wrote. Another potential area for bipartisan policy partnership is on cryptocurrency regulation.Democrats and Republicans are both eager to develop a framework in which the nation's many crypto investors, issuers, miners and exchanges can market digital assets. The market is like the ""Wild West,"" according to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has has repeatedly asked lawmakers for legislation.Better guidelines, codified rules and regulations could at the very least work to protect investors from the price volatility that has thus far dogged many digital assets. Even bitcoin, one of the world's most popular digital assets, isn't immune: Its value has declined by more than 33% over the last three months.All signs point to a major piece of legislation from Lummis, a Republican freshman senator from Wyoming and a crypto-industry supporter, in the coming weeks. While the details of the draft are not yet available, her legislation is expected to include input from a range of government agencies and tackle many currently unanswered questions faced by the industry.The industry and regulators have asked Congress to offer guidance on which assets belong to varied asset classes, protections for retail investors and clarity on the jurisdiction of the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Reserve.It's likely that progressives like Warren will want to make their own changes to the Lummis bill given well-documented disagreements about how much regulation the industry needs and how much risk it poses to investors. Still, such a massive piece of legislation is likely to be debuted with the support of at least one moderate Democrat.Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, stressed the bipartisan desire for more legislation over digital assets on Tuesday during a hearing to assess the Biden administration's recent report on stablecoins.""We need legislation. We agree on that,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""Currently, there is no federal law to address digital assets. With nearly a quarter of American adults now invested in crypto, we must move quickly to put in place a framework that clearly defines the rules of the road."" One of the most divisive issues facing Congress is whether — or how — to change the nation's voting laws.Senate Democrats failed in January to pass a voting rights bill to combat a wave of new ballot restrictions in states across the country. The majority had hoped to establish national standards for ballot access as a way to undermine new voting rules Republican state legislatures have imposed in the wake of the 2020 election and Trump's defeat.But one area of bipartisanship remains.A bid to revise the Electoral Count Act of 1887 in the aftermath of the historic election two years ago has lawmakers on both sides of the aisle looking to tighten the rules around future contests.Trump and his allies tried to use the vague language in the law to overturn the results of the election and deny Biden's victory. Specifically, the former president claims that then-Vice President Mike Pence could have acted unilaterally Jan. 6, 2021, as the presiding officer of the joint session of Congress to reject states' electoral votes. Pence refused to do that, and a mob of Trump supporters invaded the Capitol, delaying Congress's certification of Biden's victory.Pence, who last week disavowed Trump's claim, said there is ""no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.""In an effort to head off similar battles in the future, a bipartisan group of at least 15 senators have begun work on shoring up the language in the law.Their proposal would clarify that the vice president has no power to reject a state's electors, give states additional time to complete legitimate recounts and raise the threshold for Congress to consider objections.Currently, a valid objection only requires one lawmaker from each chamber.""On Jan. 6 [2021], I was shocked to learn that it only took ONE Senator and ONE House member to object to a state's results,"" wrote Tom Block, a policy strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors.""Plus, there is the confusion sowed by former President Trump on the role of the VP in counting electoral votes,"" Block added. ""There appears to be broad bipartisan support for taking action to update the 1887 Act."" Elsewhere, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Russia have galvanized members of both parties to consider whether Congress should spend more on the American military as part of the next attempt to fund a government budget.Democrats and Republicans are locked in talks about overall spending levels for the current fiscal year and are expected to pass a short-term stopgap bill to thwart a partial government shutdown later this month.The White House has thus far called for a 15.9% increase in nondefense spending for fiscal 2022, but only a 1.7% bump to the armed forces budget.The GOP has ridiculed that disparity in recent weeks as geopolitical tensions worsen between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine. The Pentagon is urging Congress to reach a deal that would allow it greater flexibility and ability to respond to changing threats across the globe.""The biggest issue where a bipartisan agreement will need to be reached is funding a government budget for the remainder of fiscal year 2022,"" Block wrote. ""There is widespread agreement that with changing geopolitical forces the U.S. needs to adjust its military spending and that will require decisions beyond the static spending that is inherent in a continuing resolution.""""The two sides are talking about an omnibus spending bill with new funding split between defense and nondefense,"" he added. ""I think this may be the biggest bipartisan legislative accomplishment/need this year.""— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this article."
2022-02-10,"The fancy, natural color black diamond, known as ""The Enigma,"" weighs 555.55 carats, according to Sotheby's.""The Enigma"" was named the world's largest cut diamond as of 2006. LONDON — A billion-year-old black diamond, which is thought to be the largest cut in the world, was bought using cryptocurrency in an auction for £3.16 million ($4.3 million).The fancy, natural color black diamond, known as ""The Enigma,"" weighs 555.55 carats, according to Sotheby's, and was displayed in London between Feb. 2-9.The auction house confirmed in a tweet on Wednesday that the black diamond had been bought using cryptocurrency. Sotheby's did not name the buyer but entrepreneur Richard Heart tweeted that he had won the diamond and would be renaming it the ""HEX.com diamond,"" after his blockchain deposit certificate business.""The Enigma"" was named the world's largest cut diamond as of 2006, in the Guinness World Book of Records. Sotheby's called the diamond ""one of the rarest, billion-year-old wonders known to humankind.""""The Enigma"" is a carbonado diamond, which is found in deposits close to, or on, the Earth's surface, indicating that it could have come from space.""It is thought that this specific type of black diamond was created either from meteoric impacts producing natural chemical vapor deposition or an extraterrestrial origin — from supernovae explosions that formed diamond-bearing asteroids which ultimately collided with the Earth,"" Sotheby's explained. Most other diamonds are found deep within the Earth, while carbonados lack the minerals contained in those precious gems. According to Sotheby's, carbonados contain traces of nitrogen and hydrogen, which are abundant in interstellar space, as well as osbornite, which is found in meteors.Carbonados typically range from around 2.6 to 3.8 billion years old — the Earth is 4.5 billion years old.They are only now found in Brazil or the Central African Republic, which were connected for more than a billion years, forming part of what was then known as the supercontinent of Rodinia. Sotheby's said this adds to the theory that carbonados come from space, as it was while they formed part of this supercontinent that the area was believed to have been struck by meteorites.Carbonados are formed of randomly-orientated, tiny diamond grains, which absorb more light and create their black appearance.The structure of carbonados makes them nearly impossible to cut and polish, according to Sotheby's, and it took more than three years to shape this diamond into its current form. ""The Enigma"" was thought to have weighed over 800 carats in its rough form.  "
2022-02-11,"Lobbying disclosure reports show the NFL engaged the SEC from July through December for ""issues related to blockchain technology.""The NFL, run by Commissioner Roger Goodell, is trying to determine whether crypto can be an integral part of the league's business, insiders say.Crypto is set to be heavily advertised during Sunday's Super Bowl game between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals. The National Football League lobbied the Securities and Exchange Commission on ""issues related to blockchain technology"" from July through December last year, according to disclosure reports.Records indicate the lobbying campaign represents the first time the NFL has attempted to influence the government agency that oversees financial securities. The league spent over $600,000 on lobbying both chambers of Congress and various government agencies, including the SEC, during the second half of 2021, according to the reports.Beyond the SEC, the NFL lobbied the White House Office, the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce. The NFL targeted those government entities for a wide range of issues, including ""federal regulation of sports betting,"" according to the filings.The forms do not provide further details on the NFL's lobbying efforts.Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are built on top of something known as the blockchain, which acts as a digital ledger that keeps track of all transactions of a particular token. This global online database is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, and it is maintained by an international network of people who help to verify blocks of transactions.The NFL, run by Commissioner Roger Goodell, is trying to determine whether crypto can be an integral part of the league's business, insiders say. The NFL currently takes in about $10 billion in annual revenue. At last year's NFL owner meetings in New York, officials told CNBC that crypto-related deals are still being examined.The NFL partnered with the National Football League Players Association and Dapper Labs to ""create exclusive digital video highlight NFTs (non-fungible tokens) for NFL fans,"" according to a September announcement. Numerous NFL stars have already become involved with crypto, including retiring quarterback Tom Brady, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and star Rams wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr.The SEC, which is chaired by Gary Gensler, has been attempting to determine how to regulate various forms of crypto.For months, Gensler has promised to deliver a set of formal rules to oversee the crypto market. The SEC chief has said these guidelines would be designed with a view to protect investors, but currently there are no explicit proposals.In the absence of formal ground rules, the Gensler has instead weighed in on more of a case-by-case basis, defining what are registered securities and therefore under his jurisdiction. That sometimes includes certain crypto investments and platforms.The agency, for example, has repeatedly refused to approve a spot bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund over concerns related to investor protection and the potential for fraudulent trading.The NFL and the SEC did not return requests for comment before publication.

Pat Toomey.The firm, Reserve Trust, had been denied special access to the central bank's payments system. Raskin was a Reserve Trust board member at the time.After Raskin's personal intervention on behalf of Reserve Trust, the Kansas City Fed approved the company's second request for an account in 2018.Toomey, in a letter sent to the Kansas City Fed, said George herself revealed to him that Raskin made the 2017 call to advocate for Reserve Trust. Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Joe Biden's pick to be the Federal Reserve's banks regulator, called Kansas City Fed President Esther George in 2017 to advocate for a fintech company that had been denied special access to the central bank's payments system, according to a new letter from Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.At the time, Raskin had just joined the board of the firm, Reserve Trust. The fintech company — like many others — had hoped the Fed would grant it access to a master account.Earlier in 2017, Raskin had left her role as the Treasury Department's deputy secretary. Prior to her Treasury work, she spent more than three years at the Federal Reserve as one of its governors.After Raskin's personal intervention on behalf of Reserve Trust, the Kansas City Fed approved the company's second request for an account in 2018. The Kansas City Fed claims that its reversal was not the result of Raskin's call.Toomey, R-Penn., in a letter sent to the Kansas City Fed, said George herself revealed to him that Raskin made the 2017 call directly to George to advocate for Reserve Trust.""On the evening of February 2, 2022, you and your staff spoke with my staff,"" Toomey told George in his letter.""On that you call, you revealed that Ms. Raskin had, in fact, personally called you about Reserve Trust's master account application after it had been denied.""The letter from Toomey, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, came more than a week after Raskin was grilled by Senate Republicans during her confirmation hearing to become the next Fed vice chair for supervision, replacing Randal Quarles.Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., asked Raskin several times whether she had lobbied on behalf of Reserve Trust.Raskin repeatedly refused to answer that question at the public hearing.She later told Toomey in a letter this week that she did not recall making any outreach on behalf of Reserve Trust to help it get approval for its master account.But she also told him that, ""Had I done so, I would have abided by all applicable ethics rules in such communications.""Raskin, who received equity in Reserve Trust when she joined its board, sold her financial stake upon her 2019 departure from the company for about $1.5 million.To this day, Reserve Trust's exclusive master account remains the company's single largest selling point to potential customers. It is the first thing the company says about itself on the homepage of its website.""Reserve Trust is the first fintech trust company with a Federal Reserve master account,"" reads the homepage for ReserveTrust.com. ""We provide payments services that financial institutions and fintechs have previously only been able to obtain from correspondent and sponsor banks.""

""In a phone call on February 8, 2022, Fed staff notified my staff that the Fed does not intend to answer this question.""White House spokesman Michael Gwin, when asked about Toomey's letters, said, ""Sarah Bloom Raskin has committed to the strictest ethics requirements in history of any Federal Reserve Board nominee.""""Senator Toomey has waged a baseless smear campaign for weeks against an exceptionally well-qualified nominee without providing a single scrap of evidence to support his false claims, and his allegations have already been refuted by the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank,"" Gwin said in an email.Gwin also provided a statement from Norm Eisen, who served as the White House special counsel for ethics and government reform during the administration of President Barack Obama.""There is no there there. Based on what we know I don't think the contact with the KC Fed violated any ethics rules,"" Eisen said.""Frankly the hypocrisy is stunning by some of those complaining who let pass conduct in the previous [Trump] administration that did implicate ethics rules, and seriously so.""A spokesman for the Kansas City Fed declined to comment Friday.Following Raskin's confirmation hearing last week, the White House defended its candidate, whom Biden nominated in January. The White House called Lummis' claims ""false.""""Sarah Bloom Raskin has always taken her ethical obligations very seriously during and after her public service,"" the White House told CNBC on Feb. 3.""Senator Lummis engaged [in] innuendo with no facts presented to back up her false claims,"" the White House added.""If Senator Lummis had any information to back up her innuendo she would have presented it at the hearing.""While it is not uncommon for company directors to call the Fed to ask for special consideration, at the time Raskin called she was a freshly retired top government official.Lummis did not suggest that Raskin's actions were illegal, but rather an example of the ""revolving door"" between politics and corporate interests.The ""revolving door"" model suggests that former government officials will use their connections and clout in government to later lobby on behalf on corporate interests for a payout.On Wednesday, Raskin and two other people nominated by Biden to Fed governor posts, Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson, in an unusual move agreed to commit ""not to seek any employment or compensation"" from a financial services company after they leave the Federal Reserve in the even they are confirmed."
2022-02-12,"Brent Whitehead and Matt Lohstroh are mining bitcoin off flare gas from oil drilling.Their company, Giga, places a shipping container full of thousands of bitcoin miners on an oil well, diverts the natural gas into generators, which convert the gas into electricity that is then used to power the miners.The process reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared to continued flaring, according to research from Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems. HOUSTON — When Brent Whitehead and Matt Lohstroh were sophomores at Texas A&M University, they decided to get into the business of mining bitcoin on the oil fields of East Texas. The year was 2019, and at the time, the idea of oil and gas companies joining forces with bitcoin miners was considered both avant-garde — and a major taboo.But Whitehead, an engineer hailing from a family with a long history in oil and gas production, and Lohstroh, a finance major with a bitcoin obsession, ignored the skeptics, and sunk all the cash they had earned from their high school side gigs in lawn care and landscaping into Giga Energy Solutions, a company that mints bitcoin from stranded natural gas.For years, oil and gas companies have struggled with the problem of what to do when they accidentally hit a natural gas formation while drilling for oil. Whereas oil can easily be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is right next door to a pipeline, they chuck the gas in and take whatever cash the buyer on the other end is willing to pay that day. But if it's 20 miles from a pipeline, drillers often burn it off, or flare it. That is why you will typically see flames rising from oil fields.Beyond the environmental implications of flare gas, drillers are also, in effect, burning cash. To these two 23-year-old Aggie alums, it was a big problem with an obvious solution.Giga places a shipping container full of thousands of bitcoin miners on an oil well, then diverts the natural gas into generators, which convert the gas into electricity that is then used to power the miners. The process reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared to continued flaring, according to research from Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems.""Growing up, I always saw flares, just being in the oil and gas industry. I knew how wasteful it was,"" Whitehead told CNBC on the sidelines of the North American Prospect Expo summit in Houston, a flagship event for the industry. ""It's a new way to not only lower emissions but to monetize gas.""

Giga also says they're also in talks with sovereign wealth funds, and they are expanding, fast. Giga's 11-person team is adding another six employees this month.Lohstroh and Whitehead are part of a growing movement of people placing big bets on the potential for bitcoin mining to transform the economics of the energy industry.""They are making their clients revenue through stranded energy bitcoin mining and solving the environmental challenge with flared gas at the same time,"" said Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council. The Giga executives are also big believers in the power of bitcoin to create a new kind of financial freedom.""No one controls it, and you don't have to ask permission to use it,"" said Lohstroh. ""That's really what drew me to bitcoin.""It's a similar sentiment for Whitehead, who tells CNBC that his views on self sovereignty, privacy, and individualism are part of what sent him down the proverbial bitcoin rabbit hole.""I wasn't so much focused on the price, as I was the adoption. I thought this was something great for humanity,"" said Whitehead. You can think of bitcoin mining both as the security layer for the network and as the method by which new bitcoin are entered into circulation.A bitcoin mining rig runs a program on a computer to try to solve a puzzle before anyone else does. Solving that puzzle is what completes a block, a process that both creates new bitcoin and updates the digital ledger keeping track of all bitcoin transactions. ""The cool thing about bitcoin that is under-appreciated by a lot of the naysayers is that it's a portable market; you can bring it right to the source of energy,"" said Steve Barbour, founder of Upstream Data, a Canadian company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities.

And if a driller can't immediately find a way to sell the stash of natural gas, most dispose of it on site.One method is to vent it, which releases methane directly into the air – a poor choice for the environment, as its greenhouse effects are shown to be much stronger than carbon dioxide. A more environmentally friendly option is to flare it, which means actually lighting the gas on fire. But flares are only 75 to 90% efficient, explained Adam Ortolf, who heads up business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data. ""Even with a flare, some of the methane is being vented without being combusted,"" he said.This is when on-site bitcoin mining can prove to be especially impactful.When the methane is run into an engine or generator, 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Ortolf.  ""But nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,"" he said. ""So unless it's economically sustainable, producers won't internally combust the gas.""Bitcoin makes it economically sustainable for oil and gas companies to combust their methane, rather than externally combust it with a flare, rendering stranded gas a thing of the past.But Ortolf has taken years to convince people that parking a trailer full of ASICs on an oil and gas field is a smart and financially sound idea.""In 2018, I got laughed out of the room when I talked about mining bitcoin on flared gas,"" said Ortolf. ""The concept of bringing hydrocarbons to market without a counterparty was laughable.""Fast forward four years, and business at Upstream is booming. It now works with 140 bitcoin mines across North America.""This is the best gift the oil and gas industry could've gotten,"" said Ortolf. ""They were leaving a lot of hydrocarbons on the table, but now, they're no longer limited by geography to sell energy."" Meanwhile, bitcoin miners get what they want most: cheap electricity.""The thing about oil and gas is that it is a very distributed and reliable power source, and because of that, a distributed sales point and reliable power draw like a bitcoin mine is quite a good fit,"" said Barbour. ""It's sort of a match made in heaven actually."" The summer before his junior year in college, Whitehead was mowing his parents' lawn in the southeast Texas town of Buna (population circa 2,000 people) when he got a text from Lohstroh, then a classmate and friend. In it, Lohstroh suggested they buy a mobile bitcoin mining container from Upstream Data and hitch it to a gas well themselves.""I just instantly stopped the lawn mower, walked straight to my dad, and I was like, 'I gotta find flare gas right now,'"" said Whitehead.It was a natural reaction for Whitehead, who comes from a long line of ""wildcats,"" a term used to describe those who engage in high-risk exploratory drilling.""I call myself a digital wildcatter because now this is this next phase of wildcatting — bitcoin mining going to natural gas wells,"" he said.A week after Whitehead got the text, he and Lohstroh hopped on a plane up to Canada. Logistical acrobatics ensued, including having to drive a U-Haul truck three hours to Upstream's facility in Calgary since neither was old enough to rent a car, but the pair wasn't phased. Upstream's lead engineer and founder, Steve Barbour, tells CNBC he initially tried to warn Lohstroh not to make a purchase, since the container was still being field tested, but Lohstroh was committed to getting an order in.""True bitcoiners those two...they're go-getters,"" Barbour said of the Giga co-founders. ""Both of them are what I, as a Canadian, think of Texans — entrepreneurial and wholesome. Just awesome dudes.""Once the college classmates had the physical equipment they needed, they leveraged a connection who had some flare gas.From there, they pounded the pavement looking to drum up business. At the 2020 NAPE summit, the Giga co-founders say they handed out about a thousand pamphlets trying to sell people on the idea of monetizing stranded gas.""A lot of people didn't know about it. Most people laughed at us. Most people said, 'It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard,'"" Whitehead said. Others said it was cool, but they didn't think it would work, and then, there were a few who said we needed to talk to the company's CEO.Then came the pandemic.""Covid hit and shut down the world,"" Whitehead told CNBC. Despite nationwide lockdowns, Giga continued to run 35 miners at its launch site, but business development virtually ground to a halt.""There was no traction in the space,"" said Lohstroh. ""Bitcoin was in a bear market. We were running around to meetings trying to draw up interest about bitcoin mining, and there was no interest at all."" The team got creative by tracking down smaller customers in north and east Texas who were either ""breaking the rules"" or couldn't get permits and were just wasting the gas. As Whitehead describes it, these smaller companies were often the ones that neglected regulatory compliance.""We were able to come in and say, 'Hey, you're flaring, and you shouldn't be. You're doing stuff that's illegal, and you have opportunity here, because you have a shut-in well. We can take all this gas,'"" recounted Whitehead.But the real turning point for the company came in Dec. 2020, when the price of bitcoin broached the $20,000 threshold. That's when some of the bigger players in the oil and gas industry started to take note, and leaders from publicly-traded companies began to approach them about getting into business.Giga has also had companies fly in from abroad to shadow their operations and learn how the process works.""We've had people from companies in Saudi Arabia come to our sites in East Texas. And you know, they've probably never even seen a pine tree before, and we're bringing them out for barbecue and showing them a bitcoin mine. They love it,"" said Whitehead. Giga tells CNBC that its revenue was more than $4 million in 2021, and it's on track to earn more than $20 million by the end of 2022.Whitehead says that some of their mining sites have helped to revitalize the local economy by creating jobs, such as field technicians and bitcoin pumpers, who go out to check the sites. In the small communities where they've set up a bitcoin mine, they are sometimes the largest source of revenue.""An area that was just a ghost town has now found ways to take their stranded energy that they were wasting and monetize it, and that's what gets me excited, because like that's what is helping the community overall,"" said Whitehead.Countless bitcoin miners now say that oil and gas is going to dominate the crypto mining industry in the coming decades, which bodes well for Giga's business model.""It's a frenzy out there,"" said Barbour.But Lohstroh tells CNBC the next stage is for the energy producers themselves to become the bitcoin miners.""I think that's the next large transition, whether that'd be power producers, natural gas producers, upstream, midstream, downstream. I think at all sectors within the industry space, they're going to be affected by bitcoin mining, because bitcoin mining is innately tied to power, and the point of energy is to create power. And so I think you're gonna see a lot of semantics and how they're interrelated,"" he said."
2022-02-12,"There's a growing list of essential things for taxpayers to know as the IRS embarks on a challenging season.It's critical to file an error-free, electronic return with direct deposit to avoid refund delays.However, there are other lesser-known issues that may flag your return. There's a growing list of essential things for taxpayers to know as the IRS embarks on a challenging season with limited staffing and a backlog from 2021 that's still millions of returns deep.There were 6 million unprocessed individual returns as of Dec. 31, according to the IRS, and those with notices or stalled refunds are struggling to reach the agency by phone.Fewer than 15,000 agents were available to answer the 240 million incoming calls during the first half of 2021, one person for every 16,000 calls, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate. More from Advice and the Advisor:What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated That's why it's critical to avoid mistakes on your 2021 return. Here's what to know before filing this season. Given that backlog of millions of returns, the IRS continues to emphasize the importance of electronic filing this tax season. ""Paper is the IRS' kryptonite, and the agency is buried in it,"" said National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins this week in a hearing with the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee.  ""The IRS still transcribes paper returns line by line, number by number,"" she added. ""They received around 17 million original paper returns last year, and the processing delays have run as long as 10 months."" However, you may receive your refund within 21 days by filing an online return with direct deposit for payment, assuming there are no issues.""The IRS has stressed this for years,"" said certified financial planner Larry Harris, director of tax services at Parsec Financial in Asheville, North Carolina, pointing to the efficiency and security of electronic filing.Electronically filed tax returns also provide another key benefit: a digital confirmation of receipt from the IRS, he said. Although the IRS is moving away from facial recognition, you may still have to go through a few ""uncomfortable"" steps to access your online account, Harris said.After logging in, however, you'll have access to tax records, including IRS transcripts you can use to verify details and avoid mistakes that may flag your return, he said.""The big one is the wage and income transcript,"" said Tommy Lucas, a CFP and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Florida. ""This will particularly help self-employed individuals or gig workers with income from many different sources.""If you're tracking down multiple 1099-NEC forms to verify your earnings, the wage and income transcript shows all the forms the IRS has received in one place.How to access IRS transcripts online1. You must register or login to your IRS Online Account.2. After signing in, click ""Get Transcript Online"" here.3. Pick a reason from the drop-down menu.4. Select your IRS transcript by year and download .pdf.You may also use transcripts to verify details from past returns or commonly missed tax forms submitted on your behalf.While some of the transcripts use a three-digit transaction code with a brief description to identify each entry, you can use the Transaction Codes Pocket Guide to check any line items that may be unclear. Of course, you can also tap a tax professional. While error-free tax returns are critical this season, the IRS has already warned about two problem areas: the advance child tax credits and stimulus payments.""We urge extra attention to those who received an economic impact payment or an advance child tax credit last year,"" IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement. ""People should make sure they report the correct amount on their tax return to avoid delays.""The IRS issued 7.4 million ""math error"" notices for stimulus payment errors from Jan. 1 through July 15, 2021, delaying refunds, and many filers are still waiting for a resolution. Although the IRS is sending Letter 6419 for child tax credits and Letter 6475 for stimulus checks, experts suggest verifying these payments online in the ""records"" section and on your accounts transcript.  However, if you're a married couple filing together, you may receive separate letters, each reflecting one-half of these payments, Lucas said. You should see the total on your account transcript and that number goes on your return. Millions of Americans own cryptocurrency, and they'll soon face an important question about ""virtual currency"" on Page 1 of their tax return.The yes-or-no question reads: ""At any time during 2021, did you receive, sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any virtual currency?""You'll need to answer yes if you sold, exchanged, mined digital assets or used it for purchases in 2021. However, it's important to check no if you only bought and held crypto, Lucas said. ""If you check yes, you're flagging yourself, and the IRS is going to be looking for some sort of capital gain or loss on your Schedule D,"" he said, explaining how it may send your return into the pile needing a manual review. If you're filing electronically, you must validate your return with your 2020 adjusted gross income. However, if you're one of the millions with last year's return still in limbo, the agency has other guidance.With a pending 2020 return, you need to enter $0 for your 2020 AGI for electronic returns, according to the IRS, and if you don't enter $0, the agency may reject the filing.""They'll kick it back,"" Lucas said, explaining how filers will receive an email from their tax-filing software and may not know how to resolve it.And if you used the non-filer tool in 2021 to claim the advance child tax credit payments or your stimulus check, you'll need to put $1 for last year's AGI, the IRS says.      ""It's going to be a pain, so it's really important for those who are still waiting or used the non-filer tools to follow these special instructions from the IRS,"" said Lucas. It's no secret that reaching the IRS by phone has been difficult. While the agency claims an average hold time of 23 minutes, filers and tax professionals have reported waiting much longer.However, the IRS is adding monthly walk-in hours on select Saturdays at certain Taxpayer Assistance Centers starting on Feb. 12. Normally, these offices are open Monday through Friday by appointment.""They want to serve the public, and they want to make filing a tax return easier,"" said Harris.

2022-02-12,"Like many people forced to work from home after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Lauren Niesz, 26, found the conditions were not necessarily ideal.Niesz, who rented a townhouse in southern New Jersey, found herself often working from a closet so that her live-in boyfriend's work calls did not interfere.Moreover, the couple's now 2-year-old dog required frequent walks around the neighborhood.After seeing an online sketch of a brand-new home, Niesz contacted her realtor and put in an offer in September. Last month, they closed on their newly constructed home in Howell, New Jersey, complete with a backyard for their dog.Much of the couple's progress in accumulating a down payment happened during the pandemic, according to Niesz, a technical product manager at Comcast.""We were able to save so much money because we weren't going anywhere or doing anything,"" Niesz said.More from Invest in You:65% of women would buy a home without being married first Rents are up 30% in some cities Inflation eroded pay by 1.7% over the past yearA survey from real estate company Redfin found that stimulus checks and the ability to save more money during the pandemic were among the top ways recent first-time homebuyers were able to save for their down payments.While the rule of thumb is typically to put down 20%, the National Association of Realtors finds most homebuyers put down just 7%, according to Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of forecasting at the real estate industry trade association.That's as millennials — the generation born between 1981 and 1996 — enter homebuying age while facing market conditions that make it even more difficult to buy their first home.Home inventory for people who typically qualify as first-time homeowners — with incomes between $75,000 and $100,000 — is at record lows. In 2021, there was one listing for every 65 households in the starter-home category, according to Evangelou. In 2019, there was one listing for every 24 households.""We see a drastic drop in the options they have,"" Evangelou said. ""They have fewer homes that are available for them that they can afford to buy."" Still, there are some conditions that could tempt first-time homebuyers into the market now.Mortgages will likely get more expensive, as the Federal Reserve considers raising interest rates to curb inflation.Moreover, with rents up significantly from last year, buying a home would eliminate the uncertainty of worrying how much you will have to pay next year, Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather said.""At least when you buy, you get to lock in your monthly mortgage payments,"" Fairweather said.But sealing the deal on a transaction can be more difficult, as first-time homebuyers are more likely to compete with multiple bids on homes, including those from existing homeowners and those willing to pay cash. That's exactly what Thomas Scanlon, a financial advisor at Raymond James Financial Services in Manchester, Connecticut, said he recently saw with one 30-year-old first-time homebuyer, who was not a client. The prospective buyer was competing for a home that received 16 offers. The winning bid was $30,000 over the asking price and the buyer paid all cash.Despite the frustrations that come along with trying to buy a first home in today's market, many times it's still the best way to grow personal wealth, Scanlon said.""Long term, you clearly don't want to wake up after a decade with a cigar box of rent receipts,"" Scanlon said.Experts say it's more important than ever that first-time homebuyers go into a transaction thoroughly prepared, or what Scanlon calls ""eyes wide open.""Start by doing research as to what homes are listed for and what they actually sell for, and how quickly those transactions are happening, Fairweather said. Taking steps to raise your credit score, pay off debts and perhaps earn more money through a side hustle will also put you in a position of increased financial strength, Scanlon said.Be sure to line up everything you need — including preapproval for a mortgage — before you're ready to make a bid.""If you do tour a home and you do like it, you will need to make an offer right away in order to be competitive,"" Fairweather said.However, it's important to not get so caught up in having a winning offer that you don't think through all the financial implications.If you overbid and are not paying all cash, that's more money you're borrowing from the bank, Scanlon said. If you put less than 20% down, you'll have to pay for private mortgage insurance, or PMI. That could cost around $50 to $100 per month, depending on the size of the home, and will add up over the years, Scanlon said.However, once you've built up about 20% equity in the home, you can have the PMI removed. But the burden will be on you to prove that and go through the necessary steps.You may also want to reset your expectations for how much you want to spend, particularly after you factor in your mortgage payment with other bills, such as car or student loan payments.""Just because you 'qualify' for that nice big mortgage doesn't mean you necessarily should take it,"" Scanlon said.Above all, don't rush into a home purchase now that you may regret later.""The most important thing is that you buy a home that you can see yourself staying in for the long term, because that means that you'll have the best chance of building equity,"" Fairweather said.SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.CHECK OUT: How to make money with creative side hustles, from people who earn thousands on sites like Etsy and Twitch via Grow with Acorns+CNBC.Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC.Disclosure: NBCUniversal and Comcast Ventures are investors in Acorns."
2022-02-14,"Officials at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs seized three non-fungible tokens as part of a probe into suspected tax fraud.NFTs are digital assets designed to track ownership of virtual items such as art and video game characters.HMRC says it is the first law enforcement body in the U.K. to make a seizure of NFTs. LONDON — Britain's tax watchdog has seized three non-fungible tokens, in what is thought to be the first seizure of NFTs by a U.K. law enforcement agency.Officials at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs say they seized the NFTs during an investigation into a suspected value-added tax (VAT) fraud case worth £1.4 million ($1.9 million). Three suspects have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to defraud the taxman.The suspects allegedly tried to claim back more VAT, which is a type of sales tax, than what they were owed, using a mix of stolen identities, unregistered phones and false invoices to hide their identities. The scheme involved 250 alleged fake companies, according to HMRC.""Our first seizure of a Non-Fungible Token serves as a warning to anyone who thinks they can use cryptoassets to hide money from HMRC,"" Nick Sharp, HMRC's deputy director of economic crime, said in a statement Monday. ""We constantly adapt to new technology to ensure we keep pace with how criminals and evaders look to conceal their assets,"" Sharp added.NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets designed to track ownership of virtual items, like a work of art or video game character, on the blockchain. Blockchains are the digital ledger systems that underpin most major cryptocurrencies.Demand for NFTs has soared lately, with sales of such tokens topping $40 billion in 2021. However, the market is prone to thefts and scams, and there are concerns that much trading activity in NFTs has been fueled by market manipulation tactics such as wash trading.HMRC says it is the first law enforcement body in the U.K. to make a seizure of NFTs. Authorities seized three NFTs representing digital art, as well as another £5,000 in other crypto assets. The NFTs are yet to be appraised, and the probe is ongoing, HMRC said. The news arrives just a week after U.S. officials said they had seized more than $3.6 billion in allegedly stolen bitcoins linked to the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.David Carlisle, head of policy and regulatory affairs at crypto compliance firm Elliptic, said the NFT seizure shows that criminals ""can't hide in the world of crypto.""""Enforcement agencies are able to track and trace criminals' transactions, and seize NFTs and cryptoassets used in illicit activity, robbing criminals of their profits,"" he said in an emailed comment Monday."
2022-02-14,"While watching the Super Bowl, you probably saw some interesting advertisements by cryptocurrency companies like FTX, eToro and Crypto.com, among others, touting crypto to the masses.Coinbase, for example, aired a 60-second commercial featuring a bouncing QR code. Once scanned, it led to a promotion offering $15 worth of free bitcoin to new users who sign up for its platform. This generated so much buzz that the Coinbase app and site briefly crashed.FTX titled its commercial ""Don't Miss Out with Larry David,"" where David jokingly mocked important inventions, from the wheel to the light bulb. At the end, David also dismisses FTX, and the screen said, ""Don't be like Larry. Don't miss out on crypto, NFTs, the next big thing.""Others had similar takes, including eToro. Throughout its commercial, the song ""Fly Me to the Moon"" played, which was a nod to the crypto community's belief that crypto prices will soar ""to the moon.""It can be exciting, and for some, there's a real fear of missing out. But it's important to understand the risks of cryptocurrency before buying in.It may be difficult to take a step back amid the hype, but experts recommend being careful, understanding the risks and taking time to research. They deem cryptocurrency to be a volatile and speculative bet, and in turn, warn to only buy as much as you can afford to lose.Here's what to know before investing in cryptocurrency. It's important to truly understand bitcoin, cryptocurrency or any asset prior to investing.″'Educate before allocate' is a phrase that me and my friends are using,"" Douglas Boneparth, certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth, previously told CNBC Make It. Boneparth has invested in bitcoin since 2014.Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are decentralized, which means they aren't controlled by one entity or government, and aren't backed by a reserve asset.Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, launched in 2009 with the intent to work as a peer-to-peer financial system. Its blockchain was carefully created with a well-thought-out ecosystem. Bitcoin also has a limited supply, which allows for built-in scarcity by design. Because of that, it's seen as a store of value by its holders.But this also contributes to why financial experts see it as more risky than other investments. And altcoins, or other cryptocurrencies aside from bitcoin, may require additional caution due to their differences from something like bitcoin, including their structure, supply and utility. To learn more about altcoins, you can read here.""Before investing in any cryptocurrency, it's important to understand what you're investing in and the associated risks, not just hype around it,"" Boneparth said. There are many different risks when it comes to investing in cryptocurrency.Tech risk, for example, is important to consider. Smart contracts, or collections of code that carry out a set of instructions on the blockchain, are essential for most crypto-based projects to run. But if there's a weakness in the code behind a coin or project, there's a possibility for hacks or other fraud.It's also extremely important that your private keys, the string of letters and numbers similar to a password used to unlock access to cryptocurrency, remain undisclosed to the public. Security should be prioritized if buying cryptocurrency, and there are many wallet options available to secure your investments. There isn't much regulation or insurance available for cryptocurrency holdings, which makes security measures even more imperative.Additionally, investors should be aware of bad actors in the space.Popular scams include sim swapping, where hackers call your phone company and convince them to transfer your phone number to theirs in order to pass the two-factor authentication on your account. Experts say you should also avoid scanning QR codes or clicking on random links, especially when redeeming seemingly free rewards, and remain skeptical of outside messages.These risks, along with cryptocurrency's decentralized nature, make it subject to volatility. As quickly as prices rise, they can tumble back down. Downturns are normal in crypto, said Tyrone Ross, CEO of Onramp Invest, which provides crypto asset management technology for financial advisors. ""Folks should know that going in, and if you have the means, you should work with an advisor to guide you through these markets."" Again, experts warn to only invest in cryptocurrency what you can afford to lose.""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, so the swings that occur are pretty typical of this asset class,"" Anjali Jariwala, certified financial planner, certified public accountant and founder of Fit Advisors, previously said.There's even a possibility of losing your entire investment, she said. Investors should first allocate funds to their ""required buckets,"" like an emergency or retirement fund, before buying into a riskier asset class like cryptocurrency.Boneparth agreed: ""Be very careful about how much you allocate and understanding what you can tolerate, because if 80% of your net worth is tied to bitcoin, and it goes down 30%, that's rough.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: NFT-based money laundering 'jumped significantly' at end of 2021, firm says"
2022-02-14,"Sixty-eight percent of ""fund selectors"" don't think individuals should have access to cryptocurrency, according to a Natixis Investment Managers survey. Fund selectors oversee the investments available to customers at brokerage houses, financial advisory shops, private banks and other firms. The popularity of bitcoin, ethereum and other digital coins has grown significantly over the past year or so.  Roughly two out of three ""fund selectors"" don't think individual investors should own cryptocurrency in their portfolios, largely for reasons related to transparency and regulation, according to a Natixis Investment Managers survey.Fund selectors at brokerage houses, financial advisory shops, private banks and other institutions analyze and choose the investments their firms offer customers.Sixty-eight percent don't think individuals should have access to crypto, according to the survey, which polled 141 U.S. investment executives at firms that manage $2.7 trillion in client assets.

Two-thirds of them bought in over the last year, largely because of how easy it's become to trade the assets. Meanwhile, crypto exchanges marketed heavily during the Super Bowl on Sunday. Proponents like Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have also helped fuel investor enthusiasm.And financial firms continue to add ways for investors to buy into the digital frenzy. The first exchange-traded funds linked to the price of bitcoin futures debuted in October. But investment professionals' reluctance is largely due to challenges they see relative to crypto transparency and an apparent lack of regulation, according to Dave Goodsell, executive director of the Natixis Center for Investor Insight.About 87% agreed crypto assets need to be more transparent, and 84% think they will need some type of regulatory oversight, according to the firm's survey published Tuesday.""I think that makes it challenging to recommend such things if they're in a fiduciary role,"" Goodsell said, referencing the legal duty some firms owe their clients. ""I think that's where the hesitancy comes from."" About 70% also conceded their firm needs more education in digital assets and cryptocurrencies before investing in them.Crypto hesitancy extends beyond fund selectors, though.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in July that crypto ""puts the [U.S. financial] system at the whims of some shadowy, faceless group of super coders and miners.""However, at the same hearing, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., touted the transparency and openness of open-source finance as a way to promote financial inclusion.Financial advisors generally don't recommend clients allocate more than a small part of their investment portfolio to crypto, given its volatility. Bitcoin prices have fallen to around $43,000 per coin from their recent $67,000 high in November.  "

Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, the ranking member of the banking committee. Only one Democrat reported a transaction, Rep. Marie Newman of Illinois, according to the analysis.The most popular cryptocurrency by far was bitcoin, with trades totaling an estimated $229,000, including through an ETF. Second was ether, with a total of about $40,000. Lawmakers even got into the meme coin trend, trading roughly $32,000 of dogecoin.Members of Congress also dabbled in some less well-known cryptocurrencies: Cardano, Stellar, Celo, Chainlink, Basic Attention Token and EOS. Each trade is reported as a range, rather than a specific value. In its analysis, CNBC used the midpoint of the range to tally total transaction activity. The analysis is based on congressional financial disclosures and information from Capitol Trades, a public database compiled by 2iQ. The crypto trades create another wrinkle in the debate over potential conflicts of interest in Congress. The cryptocurrency industry is ramping up its lobbying machine as lawmakers and regulators weigh new rules for the sector. But it's unclear whether crypto would be covered by proposals to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who has introduced legislation prohibiting stock trading, told CNBC that crypto presents different issues than traditional investing. Brown heads the Senate Banking Committee, which held a hearing on stablecoins Tuesday.

""Crypto is more complicated than that.""Toomey has been outspoken against any trading ban, arguing that it could disincentivize public service. He has defended existing laws that mandate financial disclosures and explicitly bar Congress from insider trading. A spokeswoman said his investment in crypto is merely a reflection of broad financial trends.Toomey bought shares of Grayscale's bitcoin and ether investment vehicles in June, each purchase valued between $1,000 and $15,000. ""Given that crypto has become a meaningfully sized asset class, maintaining a well-diversified investment portfolio now means owning some crypto,"" Toomey's spokeswoman said. ""To that extent, crypto makes up a very modest portion — less than 1% — of his overall investment portfolio.""Toomey has also been an advocate for the industry, sponsoring a bill last summer that would have allayed concerns about crypto-reporting requirements to the IRS. One of his cosponsors was GOP Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who has embraced the industry as the next frontier for her home state of Wyoming.  Lummis was one of the first lawmakers to invest in crypto. She previously told CNBC she bought five bitcoin in 2013 for about $300 each. In August, she invested between $50,000 to $100,000, according to her financial disclosures. Her office declined to comment for this story.However, two of the lawmakers who traded cryptocurrencies over the past year told CNBC that they support limits on Congress's financial activity.Newman's financial disclosures indicate that her husband invested between $15,000 and $50,000 in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in November. Between about $1,000 to $15,000 was purchased in January through a joint account. A spokesman said both trades were handled by her husband.""As part of the family's overall savings program to pay for college tuition, the family's extensive health-care costs and retirement, Congresswoman Newman's husband for years now has invested in a variety of companies based on public information,"" he said. ""These trades are conducted solely by her husband and are regularly disclosed in alignment with the House's current policy.""Her spokesman also said Newman supports efforts to limit or ban trading by lawmakers — including in crypto. GOP Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida also told CNBC he is in favor of limiting congressional stock trading, though he did not specify whether he would support an outright ban or whether crypto should be included. Waltz bought bitcoin twice in June, each time investing between $15,000 and $50,000. He said the purchases were made with the advice of his financial manager, but that he also sees the potential for crypto to revolutionize the financial markets. ""From a public policy perspective, I believe crypto and blockchain are beneficial for consumers because it serves as a hedge against inflation, authoritarian regimes hate it, and it democratizes currency for the underserved who are cut off from traditional capital,"" he told CNBC.

Critics consider stablecoins susceptible to manipulation, bad actors and collapse the result of insufficient reserve capital.A draft released by Gottheimer's office proposes to designate certain digital currencies as ""qualified"" stablecoins if they can be redeemed on a one-for-one basis for U.S. dollars. New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer on Tuesday unveiled an early draft of legislation aimed at placing definitions around stablecoins, which critics consider susceptible to manipulation, bad actors and collapse the result of insufficient reserve capital.A discussion draft released Monday by Gottheimer's office proposes to designate certain digital currencies as ""qualified"" stablecoins if they can be redeemed on a one-for-one basis for U.S. dollars.Qualified stablecoins could be issued either by an federally backed bank or a non-bank that agrees to maintain at least 100% reserve assets consisting of U.S. dollars, U.S. debt or any other assets the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency deems appropriate cash collateral.""I don't think we should stifle innovation in the crypto currency market,"" Gottheimer, a Democrat, said Monday afternoon.Gottheimer's legislation, which is still soliciting input from Capitol Hill and the crypto industry, will likely be the first of many attempts to structure the new market from Congress and the Biden administration.Gottheimer said Nellie Liang, an under secretary of the Treasury who's leading regulatory efforts, was supportive of his plan when she appeared before the House Financial Services Committee last week.""We've been very engaged with Treasury and Blockchain Association and many of the businesses in the space,"" he added.Stablecoins, issued by companies like Tether and Circle Internet Financial, have erupted in popularity in recent years. Proponents say stablecoins bridge the ease and speed of more-volatile cryptocurrencies with the stability of national currencies like the U.S. dollar.While many stablecoin issuers keep a pool of dollars to back up the value of the digital token, it's not always clear whether they can guarantee 100% of redemption requests for traditional fiat currencies. Some policymakers worry that a spike in redemption requests, or a stablecoin ""run,"" could result in bankruptcy at the issuer and start a domino of insolvency.

Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate are hard at work crafting crypto statutes in light of the working group's report. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., is expected to introduce a major crypto bill at some point this month.Between competing bills, more-urgent domestic priorities and precarious geopolitics, it could be months before lawmakers are able to drum up enough support behind any one bill to send it to President Joe Biden's desk for signature."

2022-02-16,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Labor have taken recent regulatory steps aimed at private equity and other alternative investments.The moves would raise transparency for investors and likely reduce the pool of 401(k) plan savers with private-equity exposure. The Biden administration is lending a more cautious eye to private equity and other ""alternative"" investments such as hedge funds.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Labor have taken steps in recent weeks to boost transparency for investors and rein in the pool of retirement savers who can buy private equity.Private equity refers to investment in an entity that isn't publicly traded (unlike stock in companies such as Apple and Microsoft, which is available on a public exchange). More from Advice and the Advisor:What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated The investment category is generally off-limits to anyone who isn't an ""accredited"" investor, someone deemed to have a minimum level of income, wealth or expertise to participate. (Retirement plans pose a slightly different dynamic; in this context, the employer acts as a gatekeeper that can choose to make private equity available to its workers.) ""The Biden administration, through various agencies, is taking a deliberate look at the potential impacts of the private equity market, especially on retail and retirement investors,"" said Dylan Bruce, financial services counsel for the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. The SEC on Feb. 9 proposed a multipronged rule to increase transparency, by requiring private-equity funds to issue quarterly statements detailing fees and performance, among other things.It would also limit the preferential treatment some investors get, such as additional disclosures that may have a ""material negative effect"" on other investors, according to the SEC. It would also require an annual audit of private funds and prohibit funds from engaging in certain conflicts of interest.  Separately, the Labor Department published a notice on Dec. 21 designed to limit the scope of Trump administration guidance from June 2020.The Trump-era labor agency laid out legal parameters for employers to consider if they'd like to offer employees a 401(k) plan fund with an allocation to private equity. But the Biden administration limited the memo's application, though didn't repeal it. Specifically, the agency said employers already managing private equity for the company pension plan are likely best suited to analyze whether private equity makes sense for their 401(k); the department ""cautions"" other companies (i.e., those not fluent in private equity) from doing so.""They put more 'guardrails' about what the June 2020 letter said,"" Julie Stapel, a partner at law firm Morgan Lewis, said. ""It's not an endorsement or acceptance of widespread use of private equity … without that prior expertise and experience."" The additional regulatory focus is largely because the market and access to private funds (like private equity, venture capital and hedge funds) have grown in the past few decades.The funds hold $18 trillion in gross assets, according to SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Globally, private equity assets have grown tenfold since 2000, about three times the pace of public stocks over the same period, according to McKinsey, a consulting firm.Further, 16 million households were eligible to buy private funds in 2019, up from 1.3 million in 1983, according to SEC data.That amounts to 13% of all U.S. households in 2019, versus 1.6% in the early 1980s. The share likely increased after 2020, when the Trump administration expanded the pool of accredited investors. ""Sometimes, [the investors] are wealthy individuals,"" said Gensler, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. ""Often, though, they're retirement plans, like state government pension plans, or nonprofit and university endowments.""The people behind those funds and endowments often are teachers, firefighters, municipal workers, students and professors,"" he added.Consumer advocates worry about increased access. Private investments carry more risk and opacity and have less liquidity if an investor needs their money, they said. But proponents tout the higher return potential of private equity relative to the public stock market.Private equity yielded a 15.7% net annual rate of return, at the median, over the past decade, relative to 14.8% for the S&P 500 Index, according to an analysis by the American Investment Council, a trade group representing the private equity industry.""The [regulatory] guidance reaffirms that private equity is a valuable investment option and an important part of a diversified portfolio,"" said Emily Schillinger, a spokesperson for the American Investment Council, a trade group. ""A wide range of data confirms that private equity delivers the strongest returns to public servants and retirees across America.""The performance gap between private equity and public stocks has ""narrowed,"" according to a report by Michael Cembalest, chairperson of market and investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. In 2009, the average private-equity fund outperformed the S&P 500 by 15%. However, that outperformance has since fallen to 1% to 5% a year — which investors may not think justifies its illiquidity relative to public markets, Cembalest said.Regulators deem accredited investors to have the knowledge and wealth to bear the financial risk of alternative investments.Households must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding the value of a primary residence) to qualify. Individuals may instead qualify with annual income of more than $200,000 during the last two years (or $300,000 for married couples).Those thresholds aren't pegged to inflation, which is a primary reason the ranks of accredited investors have grown since the 1980s.Not all SEC officials think more regulation for private equity is a good idea, though.""These well-heeled, well-represented investors are able to fend for themselves, and our resources are better spent on retail investor protection,"" SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, said Feb. 9. ""Accordingly, I am voting no on today's proposal."""

2022-02-18,"The London-based AI lab, which is owned by Alphabet, announced Wednesday that it has trained an AI system to control and sculpt a superheated plasma inside a nuclear fusion reactor.Nuclear fusion, a process that powers the stars of the universe, involves smashing and fusing hydrogen, which is a common element of seawater.DeepMind claimed that the breakthrough, published in the journal Nature, could open new avenues that advance nuclear fusion research. Scientists at DeepMind have found another real-world application for their artificial intelligence software.The London-based AI lab, which is owned by Alphabet, announced Wednesday that it has trained an AI system to control and sculpt a superheated plasma inside a nuclear fusion reactor.Nuclear fusion, a process that powers the stars of the universe, involves smashing and fusing hydrogen, which is a common element of seawater.The process, which releases vast amounts of energy, has been touted as a potentially limitless source of clean energy, but a number of technical challenges still need to be overcome.Here on Earth, scientists use tokamaks — doughnut-shaped vessels surrounded by electromagnetic coils — to try to recreate the nuclear fusion reactions that occur in outer space.The magnets in these tokamaks are used to ""contain"" the volatile hydrogen plasma, which is hotter than the core of the sun. Controlling the magnetic coils currently requires multiple layers of complex control systems.Martin Riedmiller, control team lead at DeepMind, and co-author of a paper published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, told CNBC that it's ""a really complex"" control problem.Together with the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL, a university in Lausanne, Switzerland, DeepMind said it has developed a reinforcement learning AI system that can control the magnets and change their voltage thousands of times per second.Reinforcement learning, an AI training technique that DeepMind is particularly bullish on, involves programming an AI to take certain actions in order to maximize its chance of earning a reward in a particular situation. In other words, the algorithm ""learns"" to complete a task by seeking out these preprogrammed rewards.DeepMind's unnamed AI, developed on a virtual simulator, has been used around 100 times on a tokamak at the Swiss Plasma Center known as the Variable Configuration Tokamak. It controlled the magnets in the tokamak for two seconds, which is the maximum amount of time the reactor can run before it overheats.Roughly 10-20 people from DeepMind worked on the AI system together with around 5-10 people from EPFL.""Fusion as I see it is one of the most fundamental energy sources that we have in the entire universe,"" Federico Felici, a research Scientist at the Swiss Plasma Center, told CNBC. ""Once we actually master this technology...it's a huge achievement because you will be able to have near be limitless energy for the foreseeable."" Damien Ernst, a professor at Universite de Liege who was not involved in the work, hailed the research as one of the most important applications of reinforcement learning so far, adding that it ""could dramatically accelerate the development of fusion reactors and, ultimately, our ability to fight global change."" DeepMind set out to crack artificial general intelligence, which is often referred to as the holy grail of AI.The company started by developing AI systems that could master games like chess and Go. Now, it wants to apply more of its technology to real world applications and science.While Google has found uses for DeepMind's AI, its technology has not been widely applied elsewhere.DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said in a statement that the company has demonstrated AI's potential to accelerate scientific progress and open new avenues of research across biology, chemistry, mathematics and now physics.DeepMind employs about 1,000 people worldwide, including some of the world's leading AI research scientists, who can command annual salaries of more than $1 million. These top people, who often have Ph.D.s from the likes of Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford and MIT, can command this sort of money because they're also sought after by Big Tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft."
2022-02-19,"An eclectic mix of crypto enthusiasts are trying to pool $4 billion to buy the Denver Broncos.The group, which is comprised of attorneys, accountants, and pro athletes, is doing this crypto crowdraise via a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO.Unlike a normal pool of investors, DAOs rely on cryptocurrency technology to track and validate participation in the group, as well as to facilitate the inner-workings of how to raise and distribute large amounts of cash.  DENVER — The Denver Broncos are up for sale, and a group of crypto enthusiasts is aiming to raise more than $4 billion using a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, to make it their own.You can think of a DAO like a group of individuals acting in concert with no single leader. Unlike a normal pool of investors, DAOs rely on cryptocurrency technology to track and validate participation in the group, as well as to facilitate the inner-workings of how to raise and distribute large amounts of cash. This group includes an eclectic mix of attorneys, accountants, software developers, pro athletes, and at least one mathematician.One of the people spearheading the cause is Sean O'Brien, who spent over a decade in Cisco's legal department, before leaving the corporate world to run a few small businesses with his wife.""We know it sounds a bit crazy, but it's also a bit badass,"" said O'Brien. ""The purpose essentially is to establish an infrastructure so that fans from all walks of life can be owners of the Denver Broncos.""The pro football team is valued at just under $4 billion, and it is expected to garner the biggest price tag in North American sports history, according to ESPN.Trustees of the team said in a statement that the goal is to sell the team by the start of the 2022 NFL season. O'Brien tells CNBC that while the smart contracts and crypto wallets are set up, their DAO doesn't officially go live until the first week of March, so the ""BuyTheBroncos"" cause will need to cover a lot of ground fast to have a chance.But the crypto collective has a secret weapon in Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who recently announced plans to accept cryptocurrencies for state tax payments by this summer. On Friday, the pro-crypto lawmaker told CNBC on the sidelines of ETHDenver — a major conference dedicated to dissecting the present use cases and future of ethereum — that he would be ""thrilled"" if their effort comes to fruition.""I would be excited to be part of it myself,"" said Gov. Polis.""The challenge will be it'll take a lot of money...but you know what, if your imagination is big enough, then it can happen. And anything I can do to make it happen, I'd be happy to,"" continued the governor. DAOs take coordination of resources on the internet to a new level, according to Auston Bunsen, co-founder of QuikNode, which provides blockchain infrastructure to developers and companies.""They represent a new kind of organization moving at hyper speed,"" said Bunsen.Investor Cooper Turley, who has helped build several popular DAOs, says they're like an ""internet community with a shared bank account.""""Basically, a small group of people come together to form a chat group, and then they decide to pull capital together, [typically] using an Ethereum wallet,"" Turley previously told CNBC.The BuyTheBroncos contingent joins a long list of DAOs pooling funds to buy real-world assets. In July 2021, PleasrDAO bought a copy of the Wu-Tang Clan album once owned by Martin Shkreli for $4 million, and in Nov. 2021, a consortium of crypto investors formed ConstitutionDAO, pulling together $47 million worth of ether in a week to try and buy a rare, first-edition copy of the U.S. Constitution at a Sotheby's auction. Although the group didn't place the winning bid, the movement captured the world's attention and helped to mainstream the concept of crypto crowdfunding.ConstitutionDAO's rallying call was ""WAGBI"" or ""we're all gonna buy it."" But in fact, the thousands of investors who comprised that DAO would not have received fractional ownership of the document. Instead, they would have become holders of a crypto token known as ""People"" that would have granted them certain voting rights over the future of the document. ""ConstitutionDAO was essentially a fundraiser,"" said Derek Sorensen, a mathematician and computer science PhD student at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., who's advising BuyTheBroncos on how to structure the DAO.""It was kind of like, we'll raise money, we'll buy this Constitution, you don't own any of the Constitution, or actually have any legal rights to anything about it. You can vote on where we put it, but there's no legal guarantee,"" continued Sorensen.Sorensen says the BuyTheBroncosDAO will adopt an entirely different governance structure. Though the group will still fundraise in cryptocurrency, the idea is to give people partial ownership, in which they will participate in deciding how the team is run. They also plan to form the group as a cooperative, similar to outdoor sports retailer REI, rather than a LLC, which they believe will exempt the owners from certain SEC regulations governing investing in securities. $4 billion seems like a huge amount of money, though organizations like BitDAO, which currently has more than $2.3 billion worth of crypto tokens on its balance sheet, show that the effort is not entirely impossible.""It's definitely possible in the world of crypto. That sum of money is not unheard of,"" said Sorensen. ""I'm very, very confident that this sum of money is absolutely doable in web3,"" though Sorensen gave the disclaimer that he is an academic mathematician, and thus, probably not the best person to assess the future success of business.So far, the BuyTheBroncos cause doesn't have much traction. Its Twitter account had fewer than 50 followers as of the time of publication, and O'Brien's last two attempts to buy professional sports teams with a DAO were unsuccessful. But the origin story of ConstitutionDAO has a similar tenor.19-year-old ConstitutionDAO member Miguel Piedrafita told CNBC that ConstitutionDAO was started mostly as a joke. He says that he and his friends saw an article about the Constitution going up on the auction bloc, and they started making memes about buying it. From there, the effort snowballed.""We made a Twitter, went to bed, and the next day, we had a bunch of followers. So we started working with legal teams, museums, and Sotheby's to try to put it all into motion, and it ended up kind of working,"" Piedrafita said.The takeaway? Do not underestimate the underdog in the land of crypto.The BuyTheBroncos group also has a pretty solid plan B. Organizers tell CNBC the more realistic goal is to raise around 25% of the money needed to place the winning bid, and from there, join forces with a consortium of more traditional buyers to make up the difference.Even if the BuyTheBroncosDAO fails, O'Brien is optimistic that the effort will spread awareness regardless.""While having a fan-owned Denver Broncos in a DAO-based system would be amazing, that isn't our final goal,"" said O'Brien.""We want this effort to essentially open up peoples' eyes to what a DAO can do in the real world and make a tangible connection between this web3 life and the real world. Our thought is that it accelerates DAO adoption for solving real-world problems such as food scarcity or unhoused peoples.""But as Gov. Polis points out, it sure would be good if these crypto enthusiasts could seal the deal.""I can't play favorites. Obviously, whoever buys the team, we're totally, as a state, we want to have a good owner, but this would be really noteworthy for Colorado if they could pull this off,"" said Polis."
2022-02-19,"The founder and manager of a $1.7 billion mutual fund that collapsed last year has been charged by federal prosecutors with securities fraud and obstruction of justice for allegedly inflating fund asset values to keep investor money flowing, then falsifying records to conceal the improprieties. The Infinity Q Diversified Alpha Fund halted investor redemptions in February 2021, roughly seven years after it was co-founded by James Velissaris, 37, its chief investment officer. A government inquiry began, Velissaris stepped down and the mutual fund and a parallel hedge fund he oversaw began liquidating. It was a rare example of a big mutual fund failure amid a roaring bull market. And the collapse ensnared billionaire investor David Bonderman, co-founder of TPG, a huge private-equity firm that went public this year. The Bonderman Family was a major investor in Infinity Q Capital Management, the investment company overseen by Velissaris, regulatory documents show. Velissaris had worked for the Bonderman family before he co-founded Infinity Q Capital Management. More from NBC News: Car buyers trade in haggling for sticker shockBaby formula supply issues send parents scramblingArrested after a fatal stabbing, a Utah man told police he brought a gun to Capitol riotProsecutors said Velissaris inflated the value of the funds' holdings by $1 billion and manipulated the results for at least four years to mask poor performance. At certain times during 2020 when the pandemic was roiling the financial markets, the funds' real values were half what investors were told they were, prosecutors said. Certain positions held by the mutual fund ""were reported at mathematically impossible valuations,"" according to a civil complaint filed against Velissaris on Thursday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.In addition to securities fraud and obstruction of justice, Velissaris has been charged with wire fraud and lying to auditors. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The SEC also accused Velissaris of pocketing $27 million in management fees generated by his improper valuation of the funds' holdings. The SEC said its investigation into the debacle is continuing.Mark Schonfeld, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn who represents Velissaris, provided this statement: ""James managed investments at Infinity Q with the highest integrity in accordance with all applicable principles. We look forward to vindicating James, who has been scapegoated by others who will have to answer in court for their own compliance failures and the losses incurred by their irresponsible liquidation of the portfolio.""A spokesman for Infinity Q Capital Management declined to comment.The funds overseen by Velissaris were intended to generate returns that did not move in tandem with the overall stock and bond markets. Many of their holdings involved bets on exotic investments known as derivatives, because they are derived from other securities. The funds claimed annual returns of approximately 9.5 percent before they folded.The Bonderman ties were a selling point for Infinity Q; a presentation from the fund boasted that its investors would gain access to the same ""alternative investment strategies originally created"" for the prosperous family. Last year, an Infinity Q Capital Management spokesman said the Bonderman family was a passive investor in the firm and had no control over its investments. The family lost ""a substantial amount"" in the collapse, the spokesman said. TPG, the private-equity firm cofounded by David Bonderman, did not respond to a request for comment from Bonderman on the prosecutors' charges.Prosecutors said the mispricing of assets took place from at least 2017 into 2021. Around March 2020, with the funds in a tailspin, Velissaris sought a $100 million loan from the owners of Infinity Q Capital Management, the SEC said. The loan was not made. Prosecutors' allegations of mispriced assets in the Infinity Q portfolios echo previous problems at the mutual fund. In 2016, the fund was late in filing a regulatory report because an independent pricing service had been unable to ""support"" some of its valuations. After that incident, the fund's trustees, charged with overseeing it for investors, noted they had ""worked closely"" with Infinity Q Capital Management ""to ensure that the appropriate source documentation for its valuation determinations are maintained, and the adviser's trade allocation oversight was enhanced to better identify any errors or misallocations.""Allegations that Velissaris manipulated returns and asset values for four years after that incident indicate the fund's trustees were providing inadequate oversight, said Marshall Glickman, an aggrieved investor in the Infinity Q fund. ""Why was Velissaris in a position to misprice the assets for four years?"" he asked. Also disturbing, Glickman said, is the amount of investor money currently being held back by the fund trustees to cover litigation and other expenses incurred by the fund. Last year, the trustees set aside $750 million, saying the largest component was for possible liability in connection with litigation filed against the Infinity Q fund. The set-aside is necessary, the trustees said, because insurance held to cover lawsuit costs may be insufficient, and it does not cover certain expenses, including those associated with the liquidation and government investigations.As a result of this set-aside, Glickman said he has received only 30 percent of his investment back. Fund investors harmed in the alleged fraud are also paying out approximately $900,000 a month in expenses, records show. Between June 2021 and February, those expenses totaled $7.24 million. ""This could drag on for a long time,"" Glickman said. ""If this case takes three years, that's $36 million gone right there.""Glickman said he believes the SEC should have appointed an independent group to manage the fund's liquidation and disbursements, instead of allowing the trustees who were on hand during the alleged fraud to oversee it. An email to the fund's trustees was not returned. Late last year, they approved the creation of a special committee consisting of two new trustees to investigate and pursue potential claims on behalf of the fund and its investors."

The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted millions of Americans to put plans, including weddings, on hold.As 2022 unfolds and, we hope, the worst of the pandemic is behind us, nuptials are expected to take place in record numbers.The Wedding Report, a wedding market research firm, projects there will be 2.5 million weddings this year, the highest number since 1984.

They can include not only the couple but their parents as well.""Your money history is right there in the room with you,"" noted Kathleen Burns Kingsbury, a wealth psychology expert and host of the ""Breaking the Money Silence"" podcast.When moments of financial conflict arise, Kingsbury recommends that couples fight the urge to argue and instead get curious as to whether this signals there are ""money values"" that you as partners do not share.""It's an opportunity to have a 'money conversation' and decide what you're going to do,"" Kingsbury said. While those impromptu financial conversations can turn into moments of realization, it is also a good idea for couples to schedule a series of formal money talks.Kingsbury recommends a series of three 30-minute meetings.For the first, one member of the couple gets to take their partner to their ""money island."" The partner holding the meeting has an opportunity to explain how they handle money, what they learned about it growing up and how money makes sense to them.""It's kind of like taking them on an exploration of how you think and feel about money,"" Kingsbury said.Their partner, in turn, should listen without judgment, as they would if they were encountering a foreign culture on vacation. The second 30-minute meeting would give the other partner a turn to share their money beliefs and history without judgment.In the third 30-minute meeting, both members of the couple can discuss what they like about each other's approaches to money.It's important to emphasize the positives, Kingsbury noted. So instead of focusing on the fact that one partner has a lot of debt, notice the fact that they may make spending on experiences a priority, for example.Those conversations can serve as a starting ground as you decide how you're going to handle money together as a couple. As couples work to identify their financial path forward together, it is often constructive for a third-party professional, such as a certified financial planner, to make sure they are on the right track.Even if the two do not have a ton of assets or are not necessarily high earners, there are financial planners who will work with them, Kingsbury said.Certified financial planner Dawn Dahlby, CEO and founding partner of Releve Financial, said she recommends couples loop in an expert who can help them identify key areas they may be neglecting while they're caught up in where to get married, how to pay for their wedding or where to go on their honeymoon. ""It matters short term, but what really matters is the bigger picture of where you're going,"" said Dahlby, whose firm has offices in Woodbury and St. Louis Park, Minnesota, and Scottsdale, Arizona.""You have to have a comprehensive financial plan in place prior to getting married and have a third party to come in and talk to you and your spouse about those things that maybe you're not even focused on,"" Dahlby said.Ideally, couples should connect with a professional who will help them create a strategy — such as building their cash reserves and financial protection — rather than trying to sell them a financial product, she said. Many couples make big financial decisions together even before they walk down the aisle, such as moving in or buying a home together. Others may decide that formal marriage is not for them.Even so, it's still important to make it a priority to communicate about money, Kingsbury said.It probably shouldn't be a topic of conversation on a first date. But you should make it a point to communicate on the topic the moment you know you are serious and committed as a couple, Kingsbury said.Addressing those conflicts well — and resolving them — can help strengthen the relationship.""If you have a better relationship with money in a partnership, you often have a higher level of intimacy as well,"" Kingsbury said.Are you planning a wedding amid record high inflation?

Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi is planning to re-enter the U.S. market more than two years after it ceased operations to comply with regulations, one of the company's co-founders told CNBC.But the company might not launch an exchange and instead could focus on other areas such as asset management, after missteps last time around, according to Du Jun.""In 2018, we tried to enter the U.S. market but we quickly withdrew ourselves because we didn't have a strong commitment to the market at that time and we didn't have a good management team in the U.S.,"" Du said according to a CNBC translation of his comments in Mandarin.""I expect asset management to be a bigger business than exchange, which echoes the traditional finance market as well,"" he told CNBC, adding, ""I don't think exchange is a necessary element for entering the U.S.""Du did not confirm which business Huobi will launch first in its re-entry to the U.S. A step back into the U.S. market could put Huobi in competition with companies like Coinbase. Huobi is one of the top 10 biggest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume globally, according to CoinGecko.Huobi first launched a cryptocurrency exchange business in the U.S. in 2018. The following year, the company said it would freeze U.S. user accounts and added that it would return to the market in a ""more integrated and impactful fashion."" Huobi Group owns an exchange business and an asset management business called Huobi Tech, which is listed in Hong Kong.The U.S. push is part of a bigger international expansion plan following several years of tighter crypto regulation in China, the market where Huobi was founded. Last year, Beijing looked to totally wipe out cryptocurrency mining in China and crack down on loopholes that allowed Chinese citizens to trade.By the end of 2021, Huobi retired existing mainland Chinese users' accounts and picked Singapore for its Asia headquarters.Du said that Huobi has lost about 30% of its revenue from shutting down users in China. But that has given the company a further impetus for international expansion. It is exploring setting up a headquarters in Europe, in addition to its U.S. push.

Du praised China's tight regulation on cryptocurrencies because it tackled cases of gambling and money laundering. The Huobi co-founder said that the regulation protects smaller investors. He said, however, other countries should not follow China's approach because investors might be more mature in other markets.""In China, when people lose in their investment, sometimes extreme people would go jump off the regulator's building and investors are less mature. The government took a similar approach for Covid restriction. It has sensed a danger and has taken measures to protect the safety of the people,"" Du said.

They have more experience and they take responsibility in their investment decisions and therefore, governments in these markets do not need to take some strict measures.""Global regulators are considering rules for cryptocurrency, from trading to how they should be taxed.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, moments after declaring them as independent. The move has fueled fears of a full-blown invasion, sending global stocks sharply lower as traders' appetite for risk declines.""Bitcoin's safe haven narrative has almost completely fallen apart as the rising possibility of military conflict and the worsening U.S.-Russia relationship puts the wider financial market in risk-aversion mode,"" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank.Bitcoin is often touted by its proponents as a safe haven asset akin to gold, meaning it should offer a store of value in times of uncertainty.However, the case for bitcoin as a sort of ""digital gold"" has broken down as more institutional investors have started to trade it, and the cryptocurrency is becoming more closely aligned with fluctuations in traditional markets like equities. Hasegawa said bitcoin should trade within a range of $32,000 and $43,000 this week. John Kicklighter, chief strategist at DailyFX, said $39,500 is ""first-level support heading into this week, but $32,500 looks more like the point of no return.""Bitcoin is now well below the all-time highs above $68,000, which it reached in November 2021, and some investors believe this is as good as it's going to get for the cryptocurrency for some time.Du Jun, co-founder of crypto exchange Huobi, said the next bitcoin bull market is unlikely to take place until 2024 at the earliest, when the next so-called ""halving"" event is due to take place.""Following this cycle, it won't be until end of 2024 to beginning of 2025 that we can welcome next bull market on bitcoin,"" Du said.The bitcoin halving reduces the rewards that miners of the cryptocurrency get for verifying transactions, effectively squeezing the supply of new coins in issuance."
2022-02-22,"If your teen or adult child in college made money investing, you may get a surprise ""kiddie tax"" bill for earnings above $2,200.It applies to children under age 18, or under age 24 if they’re full-time students, which means parents with college kids may be affected.You may avoid these levies if children invest in an individual retirement account or stick with tax-friendly assets. If your teen or adult child in college has been dabbling in stocks or cryptocurrency, their gains may trigger a surprise bill at tax time.That's because of the so-called ""kiddie tax,"" an extra levy for parents once their child's investment income — capital gains, dividends and interest — exceeds a certain threshold.""It combats the ability to shift brokerage accounts to your kids,"" said Dan Herron, a San Luis Obispo, California-based certified financial planner and CPA with Elemental Wealth Advisors.Previously, higher-income parents moved assets to their children's accounts to pay lower taxes on earnings. However, the IRS added kiddie tax to crack down on this practice.More from Personal Finance:Made a profit selling your home? Here's how to avoid a tax bomb After-tax 401(k) contributions can be a game-changer for big saversHere's what every taxpayer needs to know this seasonKiddie tax may apply to children under age 18 or under age 24 if they're full-time students, which means parents with college kids may still be affected.Here's how it works: Let's say a 22-year-old college student made $5,000 from investing. While the first $1,100 is tax-free, the student will owe levies on the next $1,100 at their rate.""Beyond that, gains get taxed at the parents' rate,"" said Olga Espiritu, a CFP and president of Tree Of Life Wealth Advisory Group in Cooper City, Florida.Any profit above $2,200 is subject to kiddie tax charged to the parents at their rate, assuming the student is full-time and a dependent on their tax return.In this case, the parents would pay levies on $2,800, which is $5,000 minus the $2,200. The deadline for brokerages to send Form 1099-B, which focuses each account's gains and losses for 2021, was Feb. 15, so parents may soon find out if this is an issue.If you owe kiddie tax for 2021, there are limited ways to reduce your bill before the tax deadline. However, there are plenty of options for avoiding these levies in the future, experts say.""I think you need to use the 2021 tax year as a learning experience,"" Herron said. ""Especially if there were some unintended consequences.""For example, you may encourage your teens or adult children in college to invest in a Roth individual retirement account, assuming they have ""earned income,"" or funds from a part-time job, Espiritu said. ""They could still access any contributions penalty and tax-free,"" she said. ""And if they don't need it right away, they can start saving for retirement a lot earlier than their peers.""However, without earned income, they may avoid trouble by holding certain investments long-term in taxable accounts, Herron suggested.For example, exchange-traded funds may be more tax-efficient than assets with dividends or capital gains payouts.""If you're going to open a brokerage account for your kid, talk to your accountant,"" Herron added. ""You need to fully understand exactly what you're getting into."""
2022-02-23,"Bitcoin fell to a two-week low Tuesday after Russia ordered troops into two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.Geopolitical tensions and climbing inflation are among the key factors weighing down on bitcoin's price.That's led analysts to question whether its status as a form of ""digital gold"" still rings true. A key investment case for bitcoin is deteriorating as geopolitical uncertainty and rising inflation hammer cryptocurrency prices.The price of bitcoin fell to a two-week low Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Donetsk and Luhansk, two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, shortly after declaring them as independent.Bitcoin is often referred to as ""digital gold"" by its backers. The term refers to the idea that bitcoin can provide a store of value similar to gold — one that's uncorrelated with other financial markets, like stocks.Bitcoin bulls also see the cryptocurrency as a ""safe haven"" asset that can serve as a hedge against global economic uncertainty and increasing prices, which reduce the purchasing power of sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar.With inflation at historic highs, you'd expect this would be bitcoin's time to shine — U.S. consumer prices last month rose the most since February 1982, according to Labor Department figures. Instead, the cryptocurrency has lost almost half of its value since reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November. That's led analysts to question whether its status as a form of ""digital gold"" still rings true.""Bitcoin is still early in its maturity curve to be firmly placed in the category of 'digital gold,'"" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. The latest declines for bitcoin came in tandem with a rout in global stocks, with the S&P 500 closing out Tuesday's session in correction territory. Bitcoin's price has increasingly been tracking moves in the stock market, with correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 steadily rising.   Experts say cryptocurrencies have become more closely linked to other speculative parts of the market such as tech stocks, which are falling due to fears that lofty valuations may come down as the Federal Reserve and other central banks begin to hike interest rates and wind down their huge stimulus packages.""The correlation between crypto and stocks has been high over the last few months on both inflation-related macro news and the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical situation,"" Chris Dick, a quantitative trader at crypto market maker B2C2, told CNBC.""This correlation shows that bitcoin is firmly behaving like a risk asset at the moment — not the safe haven it was touted to be a few years ago.""In fact, gold has actually been outperforming bitcoin lately. Spot rates for the precious metal reached their highest levels since June 1 on Tuesday, climbing as high as $1,913.89 per troy ounce.   ""Bitcoin, the asset purported to be the answer to every question, has quietly weakened and is notably underperforming its arch enemy, gold,"" John Roque, head of technical strategy at 22V Research, said in a research note Monday.""We're looking for Bitcoin to get back to 30,000 and then break below there and we continue to expect gold will make a new all-time high."" Bitcoin's slump has resulted in increased talk about a prolonged bear market known as ""crypto winter."" The last such occurrence of this took place during late 2017 and early 2018, when bitcoin plunged as much as 80% from then-record highs of close to $20,000. Not all analysts are convinced the latest downturn in digital currency prices is indicative of a crypto winter, though, with many saying market conditions have changed. There are now plenty of institutions holding bitcoin which, according to experts, is one reason for why it's become more closely correlated with stocks.""The adoption of cryptocurrencies by investors from traditional asset classes is the driving force behind bitcoin's correlation with equities,"" B2C2's Dick said. However, he added: ""This relationship has the potential to be broken at any time given the different fundamentals for each market.""To compete more effectively with gold as a store of value, bitcoin needs to achieve more widespread adoption, according to Luno's Ayyar.""The fundamentals have always made sense — limited supply currency not affiliated with any nation state,"" he said.""But bitcoin needs to undergo its due process of monetization, where it's held by a large enough pool of participants — more retail flow, larger institutions adding bitcoin to their balance sheets, [and] potentially more nation states after El Salvador buying Bitcoin."""
2022-02-23,"Crypto companies like Polygon and Circle are hiring top talent from Big Tech firms, enticing them with the pitch of working on the next ""big thing"" in tech — Web3.The Web3 movement proposes overhauling the internet in a way that would move online services over to decentralized technologies like blockchain.Tech executives are being drawn to the crypto industry due to its rapid growth and lucrative compensation packages, according to experts. Executives at tech giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon are quitting to take jobs in the buzzy world of crypto.Blockchain platforms such as Polygon and Circle have hired top talent from Big Tech firms lately, enticing them with the pitch of working on the next ""big thing"" in tech — Web 3.0, or Web3.Ryan Wyatt left YouTube earlier this month to lead a new gaming studio from Polygon. Wyatt had joined the Google-owned video site back in 2014 to head up a push into video games content and compete more aggressively with Amazon's Twitch platform. ""When I started at YouTube Gaming almost eight years ago, I was the first person there,"" Wyatt told CNBC in an interview. ""We didn't have a team. People were really starting to show interest in gaming video.""""I look at this opportunity very much the same way,"" he added, describing the current stage of blockchain development as ""early"" and ""exciting.""The buzz surrounding Web3 has attracted some of the brightest minds in tech. The Web3 movement proposes overhauling the internet in a way that would move popular online services over to decentralized technologies like blockchain. The list of Silicon Valley talent jumping ship for crypto also includes Sherice Torres, the former chief marketing officer of Facebook's crypto and payments unit, Novi. She was hired by Circle in January. And Amazon cloud exec Pravjit Tiwana fled to join crypto exchange Gemini as its chief technology officer.David Marcus, the former head of Novi, resigned late last year. While he's yet to unveil his next move, Marcus has been singing the praises of Web3 on Twitter.""I've never felt this connected to a community of builders like the crypto/web3 one,"" Marcus tweeted last month.Experts say tech executives are being drawn to the burgeoning industry in part due to its rapid growth.""Naturally, people will want to work on what they view as the most exciting and innovative developments in the technology space, and currently, that is crypto and Web3,"" Alex Bouaziz, CEO and co-founder of payroll software firm Deel, told CNBC.""Many are seeing it as the future of the tech industry, in the same way that Facebook and Amazon were attractive in the past."" There's another thing that's attracting talent at Big Tech companies to Web3: money.According to data from Blind, a social network for tech professionals, bitcoin exchange Coinbase offers as much as $900,000 a year for software engineers.Investment into crypto companies has surged, meaning they've got much more cash to spare on lucrative compensation packages for big hires. Blockchain start-ups raised a record $25 billion in venture capital last year, according to CB Insight figures.   Tech start-ups also typically let staff own a piece of their company through stock option schemes. With valuations for private crypto companies soaring, that means early employees could be in line for a big payout in the event of a takeover or initial public offering.And the trend doesn't just apply to the U.S.Recruitment firm Hays says it's seeing crypto companies target talent from the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Apple in the U.K. and Ireland, too.""As more crypto/Web3 companies emerge, we expect the market for tech talent across all levels to become even more competitive,"" James Hallahan, director of U.K. and Ireland for Hays' technology division, told CNBC. Web3 is still a loosely defined term. It broadly refers to initiatives aimed at building a decentralized version of the internet based around crypto networks. In theory, platforms could reward users for their posts through blockchain-native tokens, flipping the advertising-fueled model of services like Facebook and YouTube on its head.But Web3 has drawn criticism from some big names in Silicon Valley. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey argues it's too centralized and controlled by a handful of venture capitalists, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk views it as more of a ""marketing buzzword"" than reality.However, Wyatt said that when he started at YouTube, people were skeptical about the idea of watching others playing video games — even ""endemic gamers."" Now, gaming is the second-biggest vertical on YouTube, according to Wyatt.Similarly, he thinks that some of the backlash against crypto and Web3 will subside as more fleshed-out experiences, like blockbuster video games and social apps, start to get rolled out.But don't expect tech giants to take the challenge lying down.Meta started developing its Novi crypto wallet in 2019, and is reportedly considering rolling out new tools for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs."
2022-02-23,"Here are the biggest calls on Wall Street on Wednesday:"
2022-02-24,"ETHDenver is an annual ethereum-focused event dedicated to hacking and networking.The multi-day summit drew legislators and politicians, celebrities, royalty, and some of the biggest names in the development community took to the mainstage of the Castle to opine on web3, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and ethereum's major upgrade coming later this year. DENVER — A few blocks away from the Colorado state capitol in downtown Denver is a place called the Sports Castle. The six-floor building is a retrofitted Chrysler car showroom, originally constructed in 1927, where instead of stairs, sweeping ramps wrap the perimeter of every floor. The degenerate grunge aesthetic is deliberate and perfectly fits the ethos of ETHDenver, an annual two week-long event drawing some of the brightest and most innovative minds in the ethereum ecosystem.""It's like we broke into an abandoned warehouse,"" said John Paller, who first launched ETHDenver in 2017. ""It fits the vibe of that emergent, sort of permissionlessness, where it's almost like, 'Yeah, we're kinda building a revolution, and you don't even know about it.'""Five years on, and the cat is most definitely out of the bag. Paller tells CNBC that more than 20,000 people registered to attend this year — and he estimates that more than 13,000 descended on Denver for the official gathering, plus the more than 350 ancillary events. ETHDenver organizers say it is now the largest and longest-running ethereum event in history.Ethereum is the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin, and it is known for its smart contracts, which are basically programmable pieces of code that could someday replace middlemen like banks and lawyers in certain types of business transactions.Paller tells CNBC that hackers are known as BUIDLers — an intentional misspelling of the word 'builders' in a sort of homage to the bitcoin meme, HODL, or ""hold on for dear life.""""We prefer to BUIDL instead of HODL,"" said Paller. ""That ethos is very ingrained in the community.""The meme-off may seem silly, but it gets at the core of what separates these two very different sets of people.Bitcoiners tend to move more slowly on development, prioritizing security and decentralization above all else, while ethereum programmers tend to be more cavalier. While they aren't necessarily breaking things as they go, they move fast and tinker aggressively. Ethereum serves as the primary building block for all sorts of crypto projects, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and web3, a still somewhat amorphous buzzword for a third generation of the internet that is decentralized and built using blockchain tech. Most NFTs and 74% of DeFi apps, or dApps, run on ethereum, according to the website State of The dApps.The network is also on the verge of a years-in-the-making upgrade from a proof-of-work mining model to a consensus mechanism known as proof-of-stake. The makeover will move ethereum to a less energy-intensive mining process and, according to network founder Vitalik Buterin, could boost speed by over 7,000-fold to 100,000 transactions per second. As you ascend the ramps of the Castle, rooms unfold at the periphery like the chambers of a nautilus.Beyond the stages and company booths doling out generous merch (enough to fill a few suitcases, which some attendees did), there are places for massages with crystals, a sensory deprivation zone, meditation rooms, gong baths (Google it), DJ ""chill rooms"" with NFT-enabled sound systems, NFT art galleries, coding zones (rows upon rows of banquet tables dedicated to letting coders do their thing), an open bar lounge decked out in plush leather sofas, workshops for circuitry tinkering, a life-size chess set, bean bags for napping and hanging, and in the spirit of inclusivity, a puppy play room.And for those looking to break free of the main venue, satellite outings included tequila tastings, a Deadmau5 dance party, and a crypto-powered poker tournament with a buy-in of .05 ETH, or about $130.During the conference, politicians, celebrities, royalty, and some of the biggest names in the development community took to the mainstage of the Castle to opine on web3, NFTs, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), the impending ethereum upgrade, and countless other subjects consuming the community at the moment.Speakers included Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who recently announced plans to accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments; former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang; Elon Musk's younger brother Kimbal, and Buterin himself. But speakers and panels aren't ETHDenver's main draw. At its core, this is a hackathon. Think thousands of developers from around the world converging on Denver, pulling all-nighters for days on end, teaming up to build projects from scratch — and collectively battling it out for the $1.5 million in total bounties on offer. While hackathons are nothing new, many in the blockchain community consider ETHDenver to be the premiere destination for ethereum developers.""It really is tech meets Mr. Robot, meets Burning Man festival, meets Celebration of Life,"" said Dani Osorio, head of content for ETHDenver, who has spent the last several years working in infrastructure and developer relations. ""So you have this very casual, collegiate, collaborative energy that's very joyful.""""It's not a conference where you just sit and listen, and you're wearing a suit and you act like somebody you're not. You get to be you, and you get to participate in building this future in any way you see fit,"" said Paller. ""It's choose your own adventure.""One of the hackathon judges is Christine Perry, a former Defense Department contractor who got into crypto because she wanted to see what was underneath the hood of tokens. She explains that ETHDenver is where developers come to learn what's been built and what still needs to be built, and then work together to make that possible.""When I discovered ethereum, I was like, 'This is it. This is the blockchain that's really going to make changes, because there's a lot of developers here, there's a lot of people tinkering,'"" said Perry, who before getting into blockchain, made the Guinness Book of World Records — twice — for group skydiving events.""ETHDenver is a place of advancement for the space. Because after this, everyone goes back to the drawing board. They've already made their partnerships, and they just keep moving the project or the ecosystem further forward."" But the ETHDenver scene isn't all about developers. As the tech has matured, so too have the subcultures.Parts of the summit felt more commercial than they used to, according to long-time ETHDenver goers. Companies aren't shy about shilling products, and networking for the purposes of recruiting talent — and cash — is definitely a thing. The organizers who allocated space in the Castle apparently gave more precedence than earlier years to company booths.""It's a bunch of hackers that are developing and building projects, mixed with investors, but the investors aren't like banker investors, they're also hackers who made a bunch of money in crypto back in the day. It's just so awesome,"" said Keatly Haldeman, CEO of the recently launched Dequency, a web3 music sync licensing platform.Ethereum's sub-tribes also include artists like NFT star Emily Yang, better known as Pplpleasr, as well as humanitarians like Kweku Mandela (grandson to Nelson Mandela) and Princess Sarah Culberson of Sierra Leone, who spoke about the use cases for crypto in emerging economies.But whatever sub-tribe they were part of, the party didn't end on Wednesday. Buses departed for a group ski trip to Breckenridge on Thursday morning."

Ukraine's central bank is cracking down on digital money transfers in one of the latest measures implemented in connection with a nationwide declaration of martial law.The National Bank of Ukraine ordered electronic money (e-money) issuers to suspend the issuance of e-money and the replenishment of electronic wallets with e-money. The written order also indicated that the distribution of e-money was temporarily off-limits.The reference to electronic money likely refers to fiat currencies held in digital accounts through platforms like Venmo or PayPal.This is one among many new rules rolled out by the country's central bank as Russian forces lay siege across Ukraine.The National Bank of Ukraine released a statement Thursday with a spate of resolutions, including an order to suspend the foreign exchange market, limit cash withdrawals and prohibit the issuance of foreign currency from retail bank accounts.As Ukraine cracks down on pathways to cash and Moscow unleashes airstrikes and ground troops, some Ukrainians are instead turning to cryptocurrencies.

""The majority of people have nothing else to choose apart from crypto.""Tether is the most popular stablecoin by market cap at nearly $80 billion, and unlike cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum — which have experienced a great deal of volatility in recent weeks amid growing geopolitical tensions — tether, like other stablecoins of its kind, is generally pretty steady in value.At the current exchange rate, however, the price for 1 USDT is roughly 32 Ukrainian hryvnia (the national currency), or $1.10, thanks to increased demand.For months, Ukrainian leaders have been looking to rebrand as a mecca for digital currencies.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a law in 2021 that paved the way for the country's central bank to issue its own digital currency, and the president and parliament recently came to terms on a law to legalize and regulate cryptocurrency.On an official state visit to the U.S. in August 2021, Zelenskyy spoke of Ukraine's budding ""legal innovative market for virtual assets"" as a selling point for investment, and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov said the country was modernizing its payments market so that its national bank would be able to issue digital currency.Before the Russian attack, Ukraine had plans to open the cryptocurrency market to businesses and investors, according to the Kyiv Post. Top state officials have also been touting their crypto street cred to investors and venture capital funds in Silicon Valley — but the Russian invasion has pulled focus from these efforts."

Activists have deployed the crypto for a variety of purposes, including equipping the Ukrainian army with military equipment, medical supplies, and drones, as well as funding the development of a facial recognition app designed to identify if someone is a Russian mercenary or spy.""Cryptocurrency is increasingly being used to crowdfund war, with the tacit approval of governments,"" said Tom Robinson, chief scientist of Elliptic, which sells blockchain analytics tools to banks and cryptocurrency platforms. Volunteer groups have long augmented the work of Ukraine's military by offering additional resources and manpower. When pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in 2014, for example, volunteers stepped up to support protesters.Typically, these organizations receive funds from private donors via bank wires or payment apps. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have become more popular, however, since they allow them to bypass financial institutions that might block payments to Ukraine.Volunteer groups and NGOs have collectively raised over $1 million in cryptocurrency, according to Elliptic, though that number appears to be quickly moving higher as donations come in amid Russia's newly launched offensive. Come Back Alive, which has accepted cryptocurrency since 2018, provides the military with equipment, training services and medical supplies. Privately held Patreon suspended the nonprofit's donation page on Thursday after the invasion began and people gave hundreds of thousands of dollars; the company returned the contributions to donors.Another group, the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, has received close to $100,000 in bitcoin, litecoin, ether and a mix of stablecoins over the last year. Since 2016, Alliance activists have engaged in cyberattacks against Russian targets, says Elliptic.On the other side, pro-Russian separatists have been raising funds in bitcoin since the early days of the conflict.London-based fintech data analyst Boaz Sobrado tells CNBC that some Russian officials mentioned they weren't shutting off opposition bank accounts for ""fear they'd push them into crypto fundraising, which is a lot harder to monitor.""

The measure goes a long way toward elevating crypto out of the legal gray area where it currently sits, though it doesn't go as far as the law in El Salvador, which adopted bitcoin as legal tender in September.On an official state visit to the U.S. in August 2021, Zelenskyy spoke of Ukraine's budding ""legal innovative market for virtual assets"" as a selling point for investment, and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov said the country was modernizing its payment market so that its national bank would be able to issue digital currency.War with Russia, however, could render all those plans moot."
2022-02-25,"Cryptocurrencies rose on Friday following a steep sell-off a day earlier that saw around $150 billion wiped off the market after Russia invaded Ukraine.Bitcoin last rose 1.6% to $39,065.00, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day the cryptocurrency had jumped as much as 11% over the previous 24 hours, after falling as low as $34,338.57 on Thursday. Ether rose 2.1% to $2,709.22.Thursday's sell-off was sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine that also saw global stocks fall sharply. For several months, bitcoin has been correlated with other risk assets like stocks, as more institutional investors get involved and short-term investors who trade bitcoin like other risk equities have have entered the market.The sharp drop was a reminder that ""in a crisis, all correlations go to 1,"" Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis, told CNBC, adding that it reinforced bitcoin's risk asset characteristics. Meanwhile, the bounce shows the longer-term investors ""have been waiting in the wings to buy the dip"" and that risk traders are now betting things ""won't be as bad as they looked at first light,"" she said.""On the markets, we've known for some time that a big move was coming — this usually happens after periods of consolidation, and activity in the options market was pointing to this also — but we didn't know in which direction,"" Acheson said. ""Now we know: both.""The 60-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 reached its all-time high on Wednesday, according to Acheson said.""The correlation has been over 0.5 on two other occasions, and each time reverted back to lower levels,"" she added. ""It is likely that we see the same again, as risk investors cede price-setting ground to longer-term investors who see bitcoin as an insurance asset in times of geopolitical uncertainty, currency turmoil and inflation. What we don't know is when this will happen.""A stunning intraday reversal in U.S. stocks on Thursday and throughout the trading session Friday led major indices to close higher. That positive price movement filtered through to cryptocurrencies. A big short squeezeThe cryptocurrency rebound is also in large part the result of a so-called short squeeze.On Thursday, about 73% of bitcoin futures traders held short positions, according to data from Glassnode. Since then, more than $180 million worth of liquidations has occurred, and sentiment has shifted bullish, Leah Wald, Valkyrie Funds CEO, told CNBC. Options were set to expire Friday.""Given, the situation unfolding in Ukraine, market participants generally went short bitcoin to protect downside risks. This was defensive positioning essentially,"" said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno. ""What we're seeing now is the market unwinding and shorts closing positions.""When investors go short, they are essentially betting on the price of the cryptocurrency going down. Traders can short bitcoin by buying a futures contract that bet on a lower price of the cryptocurrency than where it is trading when they purchase that contract. These usually have an expiry date at which they're sold. A trader betting that the price of bitcoin will go lower would sell a contract with the hope that it drops so they can buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference. If the price of the contract goes higher and a trader closes out their position, then they have to buy that contract back at a higher price.That can push the bitcoin price higher, resulting in a short squeeze.""This momentum appears to have legs, and should continue at least through the weekend, barring a dramatic further downturn in the Ukraine or some other black swan event,"" Wald said."

Donations being funneled to the Ukrainian army in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are in the millions of dollars, according to new data from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.Research shows that $4.1 million in crypto has been raised by nongovernmental organizations and volunteer groups in Ukraine since the invasion began, including a single $3 million donation early Friday.On Thursday alone, one NGO received over $675,000 in bitcoin, and by Friday morning, that number had ballooned to more than $3.4 million thanks to that one-off $3 million donation.For years, volunteer groups have played a critical role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These organizations have augmented the work of Ukraine's military by offering additional resources and manpower. When Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in 2014, for example, legions of organized volunteers stepped up to support protesters.Typically, these organizations receive funds from private donors via bank wires or payment apps, but cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have emerged as an important alternative funding method, since they allow for quick, cross-border donations which bypass financial institutions that might block payments to Ukraine.But the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has made it clear that it won't accept crypto donations directly.A statement on the government's website said that ""national legislation does not allow the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to use other payment systems ('Webmoney,' 'Bitcoin,' 'PayPal,' etc.).""That means that while the military welcomes donations for logistics and medial support, those contributions have to go through fiat channels. Activists have deployed the crypto for a variety of purposes, including equipping the Ukrainian army with military equipment, medical supplies and drones, as well as funding the development of a facial recognition app that identifies if someone is a Russian mercenary or spy.""Cryptocurrency is particularly suited to international fundraising because it doesn't respect national boundaries and it's censorship-resistant — there is no central authority that can block transactions, for example in response to sanctions,"" said Tom Robinson, Elliptic's chief scientist.""Cryptocurrency is increasingly being used to crowdfund war, with the tacit approval of governments,"" said Robinson of Elliptic, which sells blockchain analytics tools to banks and some of the world's largest cryptocurrency platforms, including Binance and Circle.One such group, Come Back Alive, which began accepting cryptocurrency in 2018, provides the military with equipment, training services and medical supplies. It also funded the development of a drone-based reconnaissance and targeting system for Ukrainian artillery units.Other groups supporting the efforts of the Ukrainian resistance have asked for donations in crypto assets, such as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs.

We don't trust the banking system. We don't trust the local currency,"" said Michael Chobanian, founder of Kuna, in an interview with Coindesk. ""The majority of people have nothing else to choose apart from crypto."""

The United States is its biggest market.The company, which was valued at about $50 billion in early 2021, produces clothing in China to sell online in the United States, Europe and Asia but doesn't sell in China. It first started preparing for a U.S. IPO about two years ago, but shelved the plan partly due to unpredictable markets amid rising U.S.-China tensions, sources have said.It was not clear how much the company was looking to raise from its New York debut.The planned IPO would have been the first major U.S. equity deal by a Chinese company since regulators in the world's second-largest economy stepped in to tighten oversight of such listings in July.Shein founder Chris Xu was eyeing Singapore citizenship as part of the IPO process partly to bypass China's new and tougher rules on overseas listings, Reuters reported last month.The company, which has become one of the world's largest fast fashion marketplaces by targeting the social media-savvy ""Gen Z"" generation, has also been aggressively expanding its Singapore office, Reuters reported last week."
2022-02-26,"This is CNBC's live blog tracking Saturday's developments in Russia's attack on Ukraine. See below for the latest updates. Ukraine said on Saturday that Russian forces blew up a Kharkiv gas pipeline on Saturday. Meanwhile, the U.S. and several allies touted a plan to restrict Russia's financial capabilities.Earlier in the day Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv had managed to repel Russian attacks overnight and that his army remained in control of the capital. Ukraine said Russian missiles hit an apartment building in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in.Here are links to additional CNBC coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine:Ukraine fight isn't proceeding as quickly as Russia expected, U.S. Defense official saysPhotos show global outrage at Russia's decision to invade Ukraine'People are literally afraid to sleep': Living under Russian bombs in Ukraine  Sat, Feb 26 202211:34 PM EST Two separate Russian missile attacks on oil and gas facilities in northern Ukraine late Saturday caused massive explosions and fires that could easily become environmental catastrophes, according to Ukrainian officials in the cities impacted by the blasts.In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, Russian troops fired a missile that hit a major gas pipeline late Saturday night, local officials said. The resulting blast was so massive that it prompted the government to specifically caution residents that what they had seen was not a nuclear bomb.""This is NOT a nuclear strike, although the explosion is visually similar to it,"" the Kharkiv government Telegram channel warned, according to an NBC translation of the message.The channel advised residents to close their windows, purify the air if possible and prepare to wear wet masks if they smelled smoke.Around 250 miles west of Kharkiv, the same advisory was issued to residents in and near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv after Russian troops blew up a fuel tank in Vasylkiv.According to the regional governor of the state where Kyiv is located, the missile attack cut off Vasylkiv's gas supply and caused a fire so large that it could be seen 15 miles away in the capital. Fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces prevented first responders from extinguishing the fire, the governor said in a Telegram post.""This night, the occupiers are causing man-made disasters,"" said the local government of Kharkiv.The attacks on the fuel lines came as invading Russian troops encountered resistance Saturday and early Sunday from the Ukrainian military, which managed to hold all three of the cities Moscow had targeted: Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson.U.S. officials said Saturday they believe Russian President Vladimir Putin was unprepared for the tenacity of Ukraine's military response.They said Putin was mistakenly convinced that Ukraine's military would collapse within hours of a Russian invasion, and its president Volodomyr Zelenskyy would flee. Neither of these happened.—Christina Wilkie  Sat, Feb 26 202210:55 PM EST More than 240 civilians have been injured, including 64 who were killed, since Russia first invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the United Nations said Saturday.Hundreds of thousands of people are without electricity or water following damage to civilian infrastructure. Homes, bridges and roads have been destroyed by shelling that cut off communities from markets, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said.The relief agency said over 160,000 people have been internally displaced, while more than 116,000 have fled into neighboring European countries.

They are suffering from logistical challenges and strong Ukrainian resistance,"" the U.K.'s Ministry of Defence said on its Twitter account.The British report corroborates information shared with CNBC by a U.S. Department of Defense official on Friday.The U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity on Saturday in Washington, said the Pentagon has no indication so far that the Russian military has taken control of a Ukrainian city. The heaviest fighting in Ukraine is currently around the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the U.S. official said, adding that the Russians are meeting stiff resistance against the northern advance toward Kyiv.""This is very dynamic and will change hour by hour,"" the official cautioned, adding that the estimate is a ""snapshot in time.""—Ted Kemp  Sat, Feb 26 20228:46 PM EST As Russian missiles pounded Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Saturday, volunteers from the city's Territorial Defense Units collected glass bottles and turned them into Molotov cocktails to use against the invading Russian troops.

He wrote, ""While you try to colonize Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand.""About 10 hours later, Musk replied in a tweet, ""Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.""Fedorov was quick to thank Musk and later expressed gratitude to Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., ""for swift decisions related to authorization and certification that allowed us to activate the Starlink in Ukraine.""CNBC reached out to SpaceX for more details including who would foot the bill for terminals and Starlink satellite internet service provided in Ukraine, and whether Starlink could work for civilians taking cover in subways and bomb shelters underground.By fulfilling the request of an Ukraine official, Elon Musk could strain SpaceX's relationship with Roscosmos. The Russian space agency has been working toward an agreement that would see Russia's Anna Kikina flying on a SpaceX Crew-5 mission in the second half of 2022. That mission is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which allows public-private partnerships.

Here are photos from the past 24 hours: —Adam Jeffery  Sat, Feb 26 20226:23 PM EST The U.S. and its allies agreed to disconnect specific Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, system.SWIFT is an independent enterprise based in Belgium that serves as an internal messaging system between more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories.""This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,"" leaders from the U.S., European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada wrote in a joint statement.The retaliation means Russian banks won't be able to communicate securely with banks beyond its borders. Iran was removed from SWIFT in 2014 following developments to Tehran's nuclear program.In addition, the group will impose restrictive measures aimed at preventing Russia's central bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that may undermine sanctions.— Amanda Macias  Sat, Feb 26 20223:37 PM EST Ukraine said on Saturday that it will accept direct cryptocurrency donations.The country's Twitter account and its national digital minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, shared codes for people to donate bitcoin, ethereum and tether, three of the most popular digital coins.The addresses posted by the Ukrainian government have received around $4.25 million in donations, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The firm said that includes a single donation worth $1.86 million that appeared to ""have originated from the sale of NFTs originally intended to raise funds for Julian Assange."" But the donation has nothing to do with Assange, Pak, an artist whom the WikiLeaks founder collaborated with on a non-fungible token entitled ""Clock,"" told CNBC.Previously, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has said it won't accept crypto donations directly. A statement on the government's website, still up as of Saturday afternoon, said that ""national legislation does not allow the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to use other payment systems ('Webmoney,' 'Bitcoin,' 'PayPal,' etc.).""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Cryptocurrency enthusiasts appeared to rally around the cause after the Ukrainian accounts shared the codes. Justin Sun, founder of the Tron Foundation that led development of the Tron blockchain, posted a series of tweets in support of donations to Ukraine. Sun called on Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to donate, saying that he would match funds.It comes after millions of dollars worth of crypto have been funneled to Ukrainian groups fighting against the Russian invasion.This story has been updated to clarify that the links posted through Ukraine's account have received around $4.25 million in donations.

And certainly the Ukrainians have made very clear that that is what they are interested in,"" Power said in an interview with Steve Sedgwick. —Jessica Bursztynsky  Sat, Feb 26 20221:50 PM EST Germany has come out in support of restricting Russia from the world's primary bank-communication system, a move that would severely limit the ability of Russian companies to sell goods overseas or buy goods from abroad.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Saturday that Berlin is working rapidly to restrict Russia from the system, known as SWIFT, in a targeted way that would limit collateral economic damage.Baerbock's announcement marks a shift in German policy that makes SWIFT restrictions against Russia much more likely. Germany has been reluctant to sever Russia from SWIFT over concerns such a move would damage Germany's economy, which depends on Russian gas imports.German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Friday that Berlin had already implemented an almost total blockade of Russian banks, but transactions were still possible to pay for gas deliveries, and so German companies could wire money to their subsidiaries in Russia. However, Lindner said all options were on the table.SWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is an independent enterprise based in Belgium that serves as an internal messaging system between more than than 11,000 banks and financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories. If Russia is excluded from SWIFT, it would mean Russian banks cannot communicate securely with banks beyond its borders. The only other country that has been expelled from SWIFT is Iran, whose oil exports declined afterward.-- Spencer Kimball, Christina Wilkie  Sat, Feb 26 20221:27 PM EST German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the country will supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 stinger missiles, marking a reversal in Germany's arms-export policy.""The Russian attack marks a turning point,"" Scholz said on Twitter. ""It is our duty to do our best to help Ukraine defend against the invading army of Putin.""If a nation with reserves wants to transfer a weapon that originated in Germany, it has to ask Berlin for approval. Up until Saturday, the German government has held firm in its stance to restrict lethal weapons with German origin from being sent to conflict zones. That included Ukraine as Russian troops invaded and fired missiles.However, the German government appeared to cede to pressure from its allies as Ukrainian officials put out calls for help.""Keep it up, Chancellor @OlafScholz! Anti-war coalition in action!"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote in a tweet.—Jessica Bursztynsky  Sat, Feb 26 202211:40 AM EST A U.S. Defense Department official said Saturday that so far Russian forces have launched more than 250 missiles at Ukraine.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to share details from a Pentagon assessment, said the majority of the missile launches are a mixture of ""short-range ballistic missile types."" Soldiers are firing the missiles from both ground and naval-based platforms, the official said. Ukraine's air and missile defense systems are still viable, even though some have been hit with strikes, the official said. The official declined to elaborate on the condition of Ukrainian military assets when pressed.""I want to be careful here that we're not violating any Ukrainian operational security here,"" the official said.The official said the next tranche of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced earlier on Saturday, will include Javelin missiles. The Javelin weapon system, manufactured by defense giants Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, is a portable, shoulder-fired, medium-range anti-tank missile.— Amanda Macias  Sat, Feb 26 202211:22 AM EST Germany is working to approve the delivery of 400 rocket-propelled grenades to Ukraine following pressure from Eastern allies, Reuters and Politico reported Saturday morning.The German government will now allow the Netherlands to transport the RPGs to the Eastern European nation to fight off Russian invaders, Politico reported.Countries aiming to send German-origin lethal weapons for export to Ukraine have to apply for approval. Up until Saturday, German officials had ruled out sending the lethal weapons to conflict zones.The move marks a shift in how Germany is responding to the Russia's Ukraine invasion. Nations have mobilized to send guns, fuel and stingers to Ukraine as Russian troops pour in. But Germany's approval could lead to a rapid increase in military assistance, Politico reported.Germany also said it would permit Estonia to send nine Soviet-made howitzers to Ukraine, according to the New York Times. Prior to Russia's invasion, Germany had blocked the transfer, citing its policy of sending weapons to tense regions.Ukrainian officials have said they are in desperate need for arms and assistance from the country's allies. In a list shared with NATO, Ukraine leaders asked for items ranging from portable anti-aircraft missile systems and bulletproof helmets to bandaging equipment and machine guns, Politico said on Thursday.—Jessica Bursztynsky  Sat, Feb 26 202210:23 AM EST A U.S. Defense official said that approximately half of the Russian forces that were previously amassed along Ukraine's borders are now fighting inside the country.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to comment further on Russia's force posture outside of Ukraine.The official also said that the Pentagon has no indication thus far that the Russian military has taken control of any Ukrainian cities. The person said Russia's ""momentum continues to be slowed predominantly from a stiff Ukrainian resistance."" The Defense official said that the heaviest fighting is currently ongoing in the northeastern city of Kharkiv and near Kyiv. The person said that the Pentagon estimates that Russian forces are approximately 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, north of Kyiv.""This is very dynamic and will change hour by hour,"" the official cautioned.—Amanda Macias  Sat, Feb 26 20229:04 AM EST U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken authorized an additional $350 million for Ukraine as the country faces brutal attacks from neighboring Russia and Belarus.""This package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing,"" Blinken wrote in a Saturday statement. ""This brings the total security assistance the United States has committed to Ukraine over the past year to more than $1 billion,"" the nation's top diplomat added.Last fall, amid a steady Russian troop buildup along Ukraine's borders, the Pentagon authorized $60 million in immediate military assistance to Ukraine. In December, as the Russia threat materialized, Blinken authorized another package worth $200 million.State Department spokesman Ned Price also announced Saturday that the Pentagon will immediately provide Ukraine with further defensive support, including anti-tank and air defense capabilities. On Friday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. was determining the best way to deliver additional support to Ukraine, citing logistics issues amid the armed conflict.""We are going to provide additional security assistance for Ukraine. We will. How that is going to be done is still being worked out,"" Kirby said, adding: ""The airspace over Ukraine is contested.""—Amanda Macias  Sat, Feb 26 20228:54 AM EST The U.N.'s refugee agency said Saturday that nearly 120,000 Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the Russian invasion, according to the Associated Press.""Almost 116,000 have crossed international borders as of right now. This may go up, it's changing every minute,"" Shabia Mantoo, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, told the AP.That number is quickly rising, as people frantically grab their belongings and flee while Russian troops fire off bombs and missiles.

2022-02-26,"A former KGB leader, a diamond mine executive and a deputy prime minister — these are just some of the roles held by Russian oligarchs targeted by the Biden administration in a round of ""unprecedented"" sanctions against members of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.The U.S., working closely with European allies, has been steadily waging sanctions against Moscow with the goal of deterring Putin from escalating actions in Ukraine. The efforts, which do not appear to have thwarted Putin yet, could have lasting effects on Russian business and government leaders with international dealings. The White House said Friday it would also take the rare step of directly sanctioning Putin, a largely symbolic act given that the Russian leader has hidden his wealth and made it difficult to freeze his assets.""Elites close to Putin continue to leverage their proximity to the Russian President to pillage the Russian state, enrich themselves, and elevate their family members into some of the highest positions of power in the country at the expense of the Russian people,"" the U.S. Department of the Treasury said in a statement.""Sanctioned oligarchs and powerful Russian elites have used family members to move assets and to conceal their immense wealth.""

""They have more influence on policy, the kind of policy that led to invading Ukraine.""Sanctions could prove effective by constraining the ability of these players to conduct business abroad, keep assets in secure banks and open accounts in reputable Western institutions, he said. Putin's inner circle includes several people with military and secret service backgrounds who might be less inclined to spread their wealth internationally and instead choose to stay close to Putin in Russia.""Sanctions are kind of like a middle ground between diplomacy and war,"" Courtney said, adding that the Kremlin has ""18th or 19th century views of using force to promote imperial objectives.""""But they live, and their economies live, in an age of prosperity and people's expectations of honesty and transparency,"" he said.

Ukraine's government has raised more than $10 million in cryptocurrency donations, turning to an unlikely crowdfunding method to help it get through a brutal invasion from Russia.The official Twitter account of the Ukrainian government on Saturday posted addresses for two crypto wallets, one accepting only bitcoin and the other taking ether and tether, a token that tracks the value of the U.S. dollar.As of Sunday, those wallets have attracted $10.2 million worth of crypto, according to research from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. That's on top of the millions in digital currency donated to nongovernmental organizations supporting the Ukrainian military.About $1.86 million of the money donated to Ukraine's government was generated through the sale of a non-fungible token, or NFT, originally intended to raise funds for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Elliptic said.NFTs are unique digital assets designed to represent ownership of virtual items, such as artwork or video game characters. The development shows how Ukraine is turning to crypto for assistance during Russia's military offensive in the country, which began on Thursday.Come Back Alive, an NGO that provides equipment to the Ukrainian military, has accepted crypto donations since 2018. It has raised millions of dollars worth of digital currency since Russia's invasion began.Total crypto donations to the Ukrainian government and NGOs supporting the military now stand at $16.7 million, according to Elliptic.""Cryptoassets such as Bitcoin have emerged as an important alternative crowdfunding method,"" Tom Robinson, Elliptic's chief scientist, wrote in a blog post on Sunday. ""They allow quick, cross-border donations, which bypass financial institutions that might be blocking payments to these groups."" Come Back Alive had its Patreon fundraising page suspended this week, with the company saying it ""does not allow any campaigns involved in violence or purchasing of military equipment."" Patreon lets users receive a monthly income through paid subscriptions.The Ukrainian military initially suggested it could not accept funds in digital currencies on bitcoin, with a statement on the government's website saying ""national legislation does not allow the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to use other payment systems ('Webmoney,' 'Bitcoin,' PayPal,' etc.).""The government appears to have relaxed this stance, however.Separately Sunday, Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov called on major crypto exchanges to block payments to Russian users.""It's crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians but also to sabotage ordinary users,"" Fedorov tweeted.The U.S., European allies and Canada on Saturday agreed to remove certain Russian banks from Swift, the interbank messaging system. They also agreed to prevent Russia's central bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that may undermine sanctions."
2022-02-27,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered U.S. stock market volatility this week, which may have led to panic selling.However, investors may fail to reenter the market, missing out on future gains, according to research.You may use dollar-cost averaging, lump-sum investing or a combined approach to get back in, experts say. You're not alone if you panic sold during this week's stock market volatility and you're feeling regret, experts say.Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered U.S. stock market swings on Thursday, with the S&P 500 dropping by as much as 2.6% before closing 1.5% higher. The Nasdaq Composite recovered from a nearly 3.5% decline, rising by around 3.3% the same session.While some investors seek opportunities amid the turmoil, others retreat by selling off assets. However, getting back into the market after panic selling can be an issue, according to research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. More from Advice and the Advisor:What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated While the research didn't examine why certain investors are more prone to impulsive sell-offs, they found an alarming trend: Many panic sellers don't reinvest after going to cash.More than 30% of investors who panic-sold assets after previous downturns never got back into the stock market, as of Dec. 31, 2015, the MIT research paper found.It's a problem because those who leave the stock market and don't re-enter miss out on the recovery. In fact, the best returns may follow some of the biggest dips, according to research from Bank of America.Since 1930, missing the S&P 500's 10 best-performing days every decade led to a total return of 28%. However, someone who stayed invested through the ups and downs may have a 17,715% return, the company found. ""The worst thing that you can do is let the mistake of selling at the wrong time hold you back from participating in some of the gains in the future,"" said certified financial planner Jake Northrup, founder of Experience Your Wealth in Bristol, Rhode Island. Before reentering the stock market, experts say, it's essential to explore the reasons that the panic sale may have happened.First, panic sellers may want to reflect on the event, their thought process, feelings and what they can learn from it, said Northrup.""Diving a little bit deeper, was it the volatility that really impacted you?"" he asked. ""If so, maybe take a harder look at your risk tolerance.""  For example, if someone can't stomach market swings, they may want to reconsider their asset allocation, perhaps pivoting to less stock exposure, depending on their situation, he said. But they need to ask themselves if there's been a change in their core values, goals and reasons for investing. If the answer is no, they may not need to shift their strategy, Northrup said.Someone who panic sells may also have a near-term need, which may have amplified their fear, said Teresa Bailey, a CFP and senior wealth strategist at Waddell & Associates in Nashville, Tennessee. While getting back into the market may pay off long-term, experts say panic sellers often feel anxious about when to reinvest.""You have to be right twice,"" said Bailey, as it's difficult to know when to sell and reenter the market.""Typically, emotion is amplified around getting back in because you don't want to make a second mistake,"" she said. Some panic sellers wait for assets to decline again before reentering, which may only extend their time out of the market, Bailey said. However, if they cashed out based on a short-term news event, it's important to jump back in. The most common strategy is dollar-cost averaging, where someone puts their money back to work by investing at set intervals over time.While research shows investing a lump sum sooner may offer higher returns, dollar-cost averaging may help prevent emotional reinvestment decisions.""If someone has panic sold, they might have a tendency to be very emotional with investing,"" Northrup said.""It can be really challenging if someone is scarred from some of the volatility and then missing out on some of the gains they could have had,"" he said. Investors may also combine dollar-cost averaging with a lump-sum approach, Bailey said, which may need professional guidance.For example, they may reinvest every week for eight to 10 weeks and deploy a larger amount if the market dips during that period, she said.The tactic may allow someone to speed up their timeline to reinvest and get back in at a lower point.But regardless of the strategy, it's important to try to learn from previous mistakes and stick with the long-term investing plan.""Over time, data shows if you stay invested your pot of money will grow,"" Bailey said."

Defense officials also said they believe more than 50,000 Russian troops were fighting inside Ukraine on Sunday, two-thirds of the total force that Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed to the border earlier this year.They cautioned, however, that Putin still had ""an awful lot of combat power"" that has yet to be unleashed.One of the more concerning developments in the past 24 hours was the adoption by Russia of what appeared to be ""siege tactics"" around the city of Chernihiv, a small city north of Kyiv.Should the Russian army adopt a siege strategy marked by missile attacks and a blockade, the civilian casualties in Chernihiv could soar, the official said.Still, the Russian invasion is behind schedule compared to the Kremlin's original plan, a reality the official chalked up to fierce Ukrainian resistance and poor logistical planning by Moscow.—Christina Wilkie  Sun, Feb 27 202212:09 PM EST Some of the faces taking part in anti-war protests across the globe. —Adam Jeffery  Sun, Feb 27 202211:31 AM EST A growing number of countries announced on Sunday they're joining a string of nations in closing their airspace to Russian aircraft after Moscow began its invasion of Ukraine.Officials for Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria and Iceland all announced the measures that would further isolate Russia. It follows similar restrictions from the U.K., Poland, Romania, Finland, Bulgaria, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic and Estonia.The moves by the nations put even more pressure on Russia, with countries banding together to impose wide-reaching sanctions on Russia and its elite. A ban means Russian aircraft can't fly over or land in the nations that impose the rules, which often means lengthy and costly reroutes.—Jessica Bursztynsky  Sun, Feb 27 202211:26 AM EST Russian protests continue in St. Petersburg and Moscow as police try to crack down on the unauthorized rallies.

Armed forces of Ukraine, the national police, the territorial defense forces are working: they are clearing the city of the enemy,"" said Oleh Synyehubov in a statement translated by the BBC.Social media posts verified by NBC News on Sunday appeared to corroborate this, showing burned-out Russian tanks abandoned inside Kharkiv, a city near the northeastern border with Russia.The successful defense of Kharkiv could prove to be a potent morale booster for Ukraine's uniformed and volunteer armed forces, who are defending their country hour by hour against a Russian invasion force that outnumbers and outguns them. Synyehubov, the regional governor, also claimed the Russian troops who entered Kharkiv on Sunday were ""completely demoralized.""Reports of Russian vehicles running out of gas and getting lost on Ukraine's country roads have increased in the last 24 hours, but they are difficult to verify.NBC's Richard Engel saw Ukrainian public works employees taking down road signs on Saturday in an effort to stall Russian vehicles. —Christina Wilkie  Sun, Feb 27 202210:34 AM EST A senior official in the Biden administration pushed back on Russian President Vladimir Putin's claim that he was placing his nuclear deterrence forces on high alert due to aggression from NATO.""At every step of this conflict, Putin has manufactured threats to justify more aggressive actions,"" the official told NBC News. ""He was never under threat from Ukraine or from NATO, which is a defensive alliance that will not fight in Ukraine.""The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons.

The resulting blast was so massive that it prompted the government to specifically caution residents that what they had seen was not a nuclear bomb.""This is NOT a nuclear strike, although the explosion is visually similar to it,"" the Kharkiv government Telegram channel warned, according to an NBC translation of the message.The channel advised residents to close their windows, purify the air if possible and prepare to wear wet masks if they smelled smoke.Around 250 miles west of Kharkiv, the same advisory was issued to residents in and near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv after Russian troops blew up a fuel tank in Vasylkiv.According to the regional governor of the state where Kyiv is located, the missile attack cut off Vasylkiv's gas supply and caused a fire so large that it could be seen 15 miles away in the capital. Fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces prevented first responders from extinguishing the fire, the governor said in a Telegram post.""This night, the occupiers are causing man-made disasters,"" said the local government of Kharkiv.The attacks on the fuel lines came as invading Russian troops encountered resistance Saturday and early Sunday from the Ukrainian military, which managed to hold all three of the cities Moscow had targeted: Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson.U.S. officials said Saturday they believe Russian President Vladimir Putin was unprepared for the tenacity of Ukraine's military response.They said Putin was mistakenly convinced that Ukraine's military would collapse within hours of a Russian invasion, and its president Volodomyr Zelenskyy would flee. Neither of these happened.—Christina Wilkie  Sat, Feb 26 202210:55 PM EST More than 240 civilians have been injured, including 64 who were killed, since Russia first invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the United Nations said Saturday.Hundreds of thousands of people are without electricity or water following damage to civilian infrastructure. Homes, bridges and roads have been destroyed by shelling that cut off communities from markets, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said.The relief agency said over 160,000 people have been internally displaced, while more than 116,000 have fled into neighboring European countries. Ukraine's government estimates there could be some 5 million refugees in the worst-case scenario.""UN agencies and humanitarian partners have been forced to suspend operations due to the deteriorating security situation,"" according to the agency's latest situation report.—Joanna Tan  Sat, Feb 26 202210:39 PM EST Photographs reveal the interior of apartments in a Kyiv building after a rocket hit it on Saturday.

She and Lichtenstein are accused of trying to hide the source of the nearly 120,000 bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of the cryptocurrency Bitfinex.Prosecutors accused the couple of engaging in a complex series of transactions to launder the swiped bitcoin.Neither of the defendants is charged with the hack itself. At the time of the hack, the stolen bitcoin was worth $70 million, but the cryptocurrency greatly appreciated in value in the years since then.At the hearing, Meriweather set Morgan's next court date for March 25.Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Brown, a cybercrimes prosecutor, asked Meriweather to suspend the so-called speedy trial clock for Morgan until then. That clock requires prosecutors to try defendants in federal felony criminal cases within 70 days of an indictment being issued.Brown told the judge there were two main reasons for suspending the clock.The first was the extensive amount of evidence to be shared with defense lawyers in the case, which Brown said is expected to be ""complex and voluminous.""The prosecutor said the evidence would include thousands of financial transactions involving cryptocurrency and U.S. dollars over a five-year span, across dozens of financial accounts in the defendants' names.Brown also noted that authorities had seized more than 50 electronic devices from Morgan and Lichtenstein.The second reason to suspend the clock, Brown said, was ""to allow the parties to engage in discussions for resolution of this case short of trial.""Morgan's lawyers did not object to the suspension of the clock, or to Brown's characterization of their discussions.The prosecutors also wrote in court filings: ""The Government and defense counsel are engaged in discussions concerning a possible disposition of this matter.""Gerald Lefcourt, a New York attorney who previously served as president of the National Association of Criminal Lawyers, when read that language by CNBC and informed of Brown's comments said, ""They're plea bargaining.""""That's typical language when the government and the defense informs the judge"" that they are discussing a possible plea bargain for a defendant, said Lefcourt, who is not associated with the case.Lefcourt also said that ""it's not typical"" for prosecutors and defense lawyers to start plea talks so soon after a defendant's arrest, as appears to be the case for Morgan.""But, you know, there are many situations where the government surprisingly learns a lot of things before filing"" a criminal case, ""and bright defense lawyers see the writing on the wall.""Samson Enzer, Morgan's lawyer, did not immediately respond to messages from CNBC seeking comment.A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia declined to comment.Netflix announced earlier this month that it had commissioned a docuseries about the case.Netflix said the series on the couple will be directed by Chris Smith, who helmed the Netflix series ""FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened,"" about the fraudulent Fyre Festival, and was executive producer of the company's Covid pandemic smash hit ""Tiger King."
2022-03-01,"While some have touted crypto as one way for Russia to circumvent sanctions, others say that idea is ""misguided.""Ruble-denominated volume for the stablecoin Tether is more than twice as high as bitcoin volume, according to Kaiko. Bitcoin jumped as much as 16% on Tuesday, continuing its sharp rebound as the Russian assault on Ukraine continues and the U.S. ratchets up sanctions.The cryptocurrency was last up 6% in the previous 24 hours to $44,219.50, according to Coin Metrics. That rally comes after cryptocurrency prices plunged last week as risk assets such as stocks sold off following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Ether jumped 5.4% to $2,980.38. Earlier in the day the crypto asset rose above $3,000.Some analysts have attributed the big surge to investors buying the dip, Russians' attempts to use crypto to evade sanctions and Ukrainians and Russians trying to get their money out of their respective countries.Crypto to evade sanctions?Many have suggested Russia could use bitcoin, which is not owned or issued by a single authority like a central bank, to evade sanctions. Veteran investor Mark Mobius said that could be one reason behind bitcoin's rise.""I would say that's the reason why bitcoin has shown strength now — because the Russians have a way of getting money out, getting their wealth out,"" Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners, told CNBC on Tuesday.Bitcoin's rally began after the U.S. imposed further sanctions on Russia over the weekend targeting its central bank, on top of existing sanctions aimed at oligarchs and Russia's sovereign debt to sever the country from the global financial system.Leah Wald, Valkyrie Investments CEO, said the idea that Russian markets participants would use crypto to get around sanctions ""is highly likely but misguided, since it is far easier to track on-chain transactions than cash.""Michael Rinko, venture associate at AscendEx, said it would be easier to censor the Russian government if it used bitcoin exclusively to manage its central bank reserves. That way, anyone could see all monetary flows into and out of the bank accounts owned by the central bank, due to Bitcoin's public nature.""At that point it would depend on Europe and the U.S. to pressure the biggest exchanges — Coinbase, FTX and Binance — to blacklist the addresses associated with Russia, and then no other major exchange would want to interact with funds that originated from those addresses,"" Rinko said. ""So they'd be able to freeze bitcoin funds or other crypto that touched a Russian account."" Stablecoins as a safe havenSince Thursday, when the invasion by Russia began, transactions on centralized bitcoin exchanges in both the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia surged to their highest levels in months, according to Kaiko data.Clara Medalie, research director at crypto data provider Kaiko, noted that ruble-denominated volume for the stablecoin Tether is more than twice as high as bitcoin volume, which she said suggests stablecoins could play a more important role as a safe haven asset or in circumventing sanctions.""Most dollar-pegged stablecoins such as Tether or USDC are issued by centralized companies that could be targeted by sanctions, which could force them to monitor transactions,"" she said. ""There is precedent to cenralized stablecoin issuers 'blacklisting' certain addresses, so it will be interesting to see how the role of stablecoins evolves throughout the crisis.""Rinko said the conflict in Ukraine isn't the reason for crypto's outperformance in the market this week. Instead, investors are pricing out Federal Reserve rate hikes, he said."

2022-03-01,"WHEN: Today, Tuesday, March 1, 2022WHERE: CNBC's ""Squawk Box""Following are excerpts from the unofficial transcript of a CNBC interview with Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" (M-F 6AM – 9AM ET) today, Tuesday, March 1st. Following is a link to video on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/03/01/airbnb-to-offer-free-short-term-housing-for-up-to-100000-ukrainian-refugees.html.All references must be sourced to CNBC.PART IANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Welcome back to ""Squawk."" More than half a million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion. On Monday, Airbnb announcing it is offering free temporary housing for up to 100,000 refugees. Company building upon that program that it launched following the crisis in Afghanistan. In an interview last night, I asked Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky about how this all came together.BRIAN CHESKY: When this crisis unfolded and we started really realizing last Thursday or Friday that there were going to be presumably hundreds of thousands of displaced people, we went into action and really over the weekend, it was 24 hours working around the clock with a huge group of people to be able to mobilize. We reached out to governments in Poland and Germany and Hungary and Romania, and countries even west of them to offer assistance. We've been reaching out to our hosts, we've secured funding and so we're prepared to house up to 100,000 refugees, and frankly, we can house as many refugees we have hosts.SORKIN: And so when you say you've secured funding, how much does this cost?CHESKY: It's hard to know. I mean, I've put in millions of dollars into this initiative. I also personally put in millions of dollars as a donor of Airbnb.org. Other donors have, it's a little unclear because we don't know how many people we are going to house. We're gonna house as many as possible, but also hosts have an option to host for free, at a discount or full price. So where we pay money is when it's discounted or full price. Obviously we won't pay anything if it's a free stay and we'd love as many free stays as possible, but not everyone can do that. So it's just not possible but you know, it will be a substantial investment.PART IISORKIN: Meantime on Monday, Airbnb announcing it's offering free temporary housing for up to 100,000 refugees. Airbnb has more listings in the European Union than any other region. I asked Brian Chesky in an interview yesterday about the listings it has in Russia.CHESKY: It is going to be very hard for Russian hosts to get paid given a lot of the restrictions on money that are being accrued on banks locally. Obviously, we have to pay and remit hosts. So I think effectively a lot of the limitations are already on our local community there but I've been really focused the last few days on providing housing for refugees. That's where I'm focused on right now and we'll kind of see how the situation plays out.SORKIN: You mentioned payments, and it's an important question. Have you thought through the implications of for example, putting limits on or the fact that banks are going to put limits on the SWIFT system, how you make those payments currently? Are people thinking about using other payment systems and the like?CHESKY: Yeah, I mean, we're thinking about like a range of contingencies. So I mean, we have a payments team that's handled $330 billion through our platform in the last dozen years alone. So we've worked on we have a lot of contingencies. It's just we're only, you know, days into this crisis, so it's hard to know how it's gonna play out right now.SORKIN: We're starting to see some people try to take payment in crypto in Ukraine as a result of this. Does Airbnb support crypto?CHESKY: Well, Airbnb is I mean, I am personally supportive of the idea of crypto, of course, I think it's a really interesting technology. I went on Twitter in the beginning of the year and I asked a community on Twitter like if Airbnb can launch anything in 2022, what would it be? The number one response was add crypto payments, so I have a team looking into that. We don't have anything to announce but we are absolutely looking into this and specific to this crisis, you know, I don't know, nothing's going to be able to be implemented probably that quickly. So right now we're really focused on is providing housing for refugees. That's what I've mobilized a team to do.SORKIN: I also spoke to Brian about inflation and the increasing price for bookings.CHESKY: I think like like a lot of services, we are seeing prices go up. Our average daily rate is up. Now, what is important to note is one of the biggest reasons that our average daily rate is up is actually a mix shift. People are shifting towards booking one- or two-bedroom homes and studios in urban markets to larger homes. We've also had a mix shift from Latin America, Asia, which has been depressed especially Asia has been in particular depressed towards more expensive homes in North America and Europe. So that's been the primary explanation for why our average daily rates are up but again, I think that prices across the board and a lot of services are going up. I think one other thing I'm trying to say I think a lot of hosts, a lot of people are turning to hosting, obviously, with inflation, with a lot of economic uncertainty a lot of people see hosting as a really important way to make supplemental income. So hopefully this is a way to be able to help a number of people.SORKIN: And Brian Chesky recently announcing he will be living in different Airbnbs this year moving to a new location every few weeks. Even hosting the company's latest earnings call while on the road in Miami last month, I asked Brian Chesky on how he thinks about the future of work and whether hybrid's really here to stay.CHESKY: I think this is the beginning of a revolution in how we're going to work. I mean, obviously, there is ultimately I think, I don't think CEOs or even government officials are going to determine whether or not people return to work and how frequently. I think the employees will and what the employees are voting on is they are voting on flexibility. And I think after compensation, flexibility about where people work will be the number two benefit that ultimately CEOs have to compete for the very best talent. So I think we're living in a world where it's gonna be a lot more flexibility. The lines between travel, living and working are blurring together. And I think this is the very beginning of signs to come. And it's just good for everyone to remember, this is the worst that technology will ever be in our lifetime so obviously, camera technology, bandwidth, everything's going to get a lot better. And so I think that's going to allow for a lot more remote work. That being said, we are going to need to gather. This is one of the loneliest times in human history. We can't just stare at screens all day because then we're going to reproduce the movie Wally, I don't think anyone wants to do that. So it's going to be a balance, but I don't think it's five days a week. Anyone who thinks people are going back to the office five days a week or even the majority of days will probably be an outlier. That's not really where the world's going."
2022-03-02,"Washington takes aim at Russia's access to digital cash as the U.S. and its allies levy heavy punitive measures against Moscow.The concern is that the Kremlin, as well as other ancillary actors supporting the offensive on Ukraine, will evade the sanctions regime via digital tokens, which are not owned or issued by a central authority like a bank.Bitcoin, among other altcoins, is decentralized and borderless, which means that it doesn't respect national boundaries. Because there is no central authority to block transactions, digital currencies are also considered to be censorship resistant. As Moscow's war on Ukraine rages on and the Russian economy and currency spiral to new lows, Washington is reportedly trying out a new way to dial up the pressure on Putin: sanctions targeting cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.The Department of Justice announced early Wednesday a new task force broadly designed to enforce sanctions. As part of that, it will target efforts to use cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions, launder proceeds of foreign corruption or evade U.S. responses to Russian military aggression.Taking aim at Russia's access to digital cash comes as the U.S. and its allies, including notoriously neutral Switzerland, levy heavy punitive measures against Moscow.The concern is that the Kremlin, as well as other ancillary actors supporting the offensive on Ukraine, will evade the sanctions regime via digital tokens, which are not owned or issued by a central authority like a bank. Bitcoin, like most cryptocurrencies, is decentralized and borderless, which means that it doesn't respect national boundaries. Because there is no central authority to block transactions, digital currencies are also resistant.Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, stats from crypto data provider Kaiko show that transactions on centralized bitcoin exchanges in both the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia have surged to their highest levels in months. This is likely part of the reason why Ukraine asked all the top crypto exchanges to ban Russian users — a request that has been rejected by many major players, who argue a move like that would go against the very reason why cryptocurrencies exist.Despite growing signs of crypto adoption — as well as dialed-up rhetoric from world leaders about banning sanctioned Russians from digital currency exchanges — crypto as a pathway to sidestepping sanctions isn't really a viable option at scale.First of all, crypto markets offer thin liquidity and token transactions are, by design, traceable via a public ledger known as the blockchain. Aside from that, experts tell CNBC that ultimately there are better and smarter ways than using bitcoin to get around global financial blockades.""The size and scale of crypto markets — and their state of liquidity — is not sufficient enough to offset what happens from banking disruptions and other disruptions from sanctions,"" said Yaya Fanusie, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security who assesses national security and money laundering risks related to digital assets.""It's akin to, if someone were to block your paycheck for a month and then you had to rely on your piggy bank to make up for it,"" he said. Russia is no stranger to sanctions, and its political class has spent years getting creative on workarounds.Moscow faced international condemnation in 2014 after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine. That was also the year that a passenger plane headed from the Netherlands to Malaysia was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile fired over territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.Since then, President Vladimir Putin has built buffers to insulate Russia from the blowback of Western sanctions, which economists estimate has cost Russia $50 billion a year.Typically, the way sanctions work is that a government generates a list of the individuals and companies that must be avoided, and those doing business with these banned entities are subject to heavy fines. But sanctions are only as good as the KYC (Know Your Customer) onboarding requirements, explained Sarah Beth Felix, an authority on anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance.""Depending on how strict that is, then that drives the data, which drives whether or not the sanctions are actually effective,"" Felix says. ""That is agnostic when it comes to the underlying flow of funds, whether it be crypto, fiat, wires, payable-through accounts — it all lives or dies on the underlying data that's captured and verified on the ownership of the company, the individual, and all that kind of stuff.""Part of Putin's strategy involved diversifying away from U.S. treasuries and the U.S. dollar, cultivating a new kind of debt structure largely based on euros and gold. Putin's war chest includes $630 billion in foreign reserves, which serves as a sort of financial shield meant to dull the impact of sweeping sanctions.

CNBC has reported that Russia has a debt-to-GDP ratio of only 18%, a current account surplus, and the price of oil surging past $113 a barrel (its highest level in more than a decade) is certainly a boon. Thus far, the White House has steered clear of sanctioning Russian oil sales.Moreover, experts tell CNBC that Russians have been bracing for this kind of crackdown for months.""Russia's elite and financial authorities have been preparing for sanctions for some time,"" said Salman Banaei, head of public policy for North American for Chainalysis, which specializes in tracking activity on blockchain networks.Any movement of funds likely happened prior to Russia's invasion, Felix agreed. ""I would assume billions and billions of dollars already moved through these front companies and shell corporations that we have around the world that are owned by Russian businesses and individuals, regardless of whether it involved crypto or normal bank-to-bank wires,"" said Felix.Banaei agrees that it is unlikely that designated persons would opt to move around large quantities of crypto at this point. Instead, Banaei says that if cryptocurrency is being used to evade sanctions, it likely would have happened slowly, over the past several months. ""At the end of all of this, the glaring, massive gap that we have is in the transparency of who owns what companies, not just in the U.S., but around the world,"" explained Felix. Even if Russia wanted to use crypto to evade sanctions, its economy is too big, the crypto market is too small, and any huge transactions would likely be flagged.""The size of crypto markets is small compared to what's happening in the banking sector,"" said Fanusie.The U.S. has placed new debt and equity restrictions on some of Russia's most critical state-owned enterprises with estimated assets of nearly $1.4 trillion. These entities won't be able to raise money through the U.S. market, a critical source of capital. The total cryptocurrency market cap is at around $1.9 trillion.Cryptocurrencies are also thinly traded, which means that it can prove difficult to buy large swaths of digital tokens like bitcoin. The bitcoin-ruble pair maxes out at about $250,000 per trade on Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, versus the bitcoin and U.S. dollar pairing, which has a maximum market order of around $2.6 million.The size of the transactions that the Russian government would need to conduct would be multiples of what individual Russian citizens might be doing right now, explained anti-money laundering compliance expert Ross Delston. Not only would that prove difficult to do in terms of liquidity limitations, but it could also red flag the transaction entirely.""On the blockchain, the size of the transaction is immediately available, and very sizable transactions would be very apparent to anyone looking,"" Delston said, who added that cryptocurrencies aren't the bastion of anonymity they are so often made out to be.While crypto has the advantage of not involving wire transfers from bank to bank (which are heavily policed to ensure sanctions compliance), every transfer ever made is captured on a public, permanent, and immutable blockchain ledger and can be traced in nanoseconds.""If I hand you find a $5 bill, you can never trace that back to me, where if I were to transfer you money through my wallet, that's always linked back to my wallet ID, which if I went through a regulated exchange, has all of my CIP (Customer Identification Program) information,"" explained Felix.Chainalysis' Banaei tells CNBC that a single tip in the cryptocurrency market can, within hours, uncover a network of wallet addresses involved in ransomware fraud and money laundering, while a similar tip relating to a traditional bank wire could take several months to reach a similar level of visibility into a criminal network and its money laundering.  While there are privacy tokens like monero, dash, and zcash, which have additional anonymity built into them, they tend not to be as liquid as other tokens, since many regulated exchanges have chosen not to list them due to regulatory concerns.There is also the question of what to do once you have the crypto in hand.""It's hard to buy stuff with cryptocurrency, especially big stuff,"" Delston tells CNBC. He says that he doesn't know of any major electronics companies, food exporters, or spare parts manufacturers that accept cryptocurrency as payment, which he notes are ""all the kinds of things that a country like Russia would need, because it doesn't produce it on its own.""And while historically crypto exchange compliance with the global sanctions regime hasn't been great, Fanusie says it's actually getting much better, as these platforms beef up their internal compliance teams.Federal prosecutors are adding muscle to their crypto policing duties, as well. In February, the U.S. Justice Department unveiled a new cryptocurrency enforcement team. While a lot of attention goes to the potential for bitcoin to facilitate sanctions evasion, the bigger story to Fanusie is what sanctioned actors are doing with central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs.The Bank of Russia released a consultation paper for a ""digital ruble"" in October 2020, and Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said the country plans to prototype and pilot it this year.The digital ruble would be a virtual version of the country's national currency that — similar to China's digital yuan — would be controlled centrally by the Bank of Russia and use some form of distributed ledger technology.At the time it was first announced, a Moscow newspaper, citing officials, said a digital ruble would both reduce dependency on the dollar, as well as mitigate exposure to sanctions.Well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, former U.S. Treasury official Michael Greenwald told CNBC that a digital ruble could prove problematic for the U.S.""What alarms me is if Russia, China, and Iran each creates central bank digital currencies to operate outside of the dollar and other countries followed them,"" he said. ""That would be alarming."""
2022-03-02,"Ukraine has started to accept dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies such as solana as donations toward its military as Russia's invasion continues.The Ukrainian government has raised $35 million, through more than 35,000 cryptoasset donations since the start of the Russian invasion, according to Elliptic, a blockchain analytics company.Cryptocurrencies have become a prominent feature of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine has expanded the number of cryptocurrencies it is accepting for donations toward its military as Russia's invasion continues.On Wednesday, Mykhailo Fedorov, vice prime minister of Ukraine, said people can send dogecoin as a donation. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency which originally started off as a joke and has been talked up by Tesla founder Elon Musk.It is often dubbed a ""memecoin,"" referring to popular internet jokes.""Now even meme can support our army and save lives from Russian invaders,"" Fedorov tweeted.On Tuesday, Fedorov tweeted about a project called Aid For Ukraine. It is a collaboration between the Ukrainian government, Everstake and a cryptocurrency blockchain platform called Solana.People can now donate solana cryptocurrency as well as any other digital tokens based upon Solana.Ukraine is also accepting non-fungible tokens or NFTs as donations too. These are unique assets such as a piece of digital art stored using blockchain technology to verify and track each NFT. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap has built a function that allows people to convert any Ethereum-based digital currencies into ether and send it to the Ukrainian government. Ethereum is a blockchain platform that developers can build apps on top of.Fedorov also said that Gavin Wood, the co-founder of a blockchain platform called Polkadot, sent $5 million worth of the DOT cryptocurrency to Ukraine.The Ukrainian government has raised $35 million, through more than 35,000 cryptoasset donations since the start of the Russian invasion, according to Elliptic, a blockchain analytics company.On Feb. 26, Ukraine began accepting cryptocurrencies for donations and began with bitcoin, ether and a stablecoin called tether. Stablecoins are digital currencies tied to real-world assets such as fiat currency.Now Ukraine is stepping up the number of cryptocurrencies that it will accept for donations. It comes as military experts expect Russia's attacks to increase in ferocity and destructiveness. While cryptocurrency donations are adding some money to Ukraine's resistance effort, the country has raised more via war bonds, which have brought in about 8.14 billion Ukrainian hryvnia ($270 million).On Wednesday, an official Ukraine government account tweeted that an ""airdrop"" is confirmed and would take place on Thursday. An airdrop is usually when an individual or entity gives away cryptocurrency for free. But details were scarce and it's unclear what digital currency would be given away and to whom.Cryptocurrencies have become a prominent feature of the war between Russia and Ukraine. There has been speculation that Russians could use cryptocurrencies to get their money out of the country to evade sanctions, though experts said this could be extremely difficult.Last week, Fedorov called on major cryptocurrency exchanges to block the accounts of Russian users. Binance, the world's biggest exchange, said it would block addresses of any users that had been sanctioned, but not accounts of all Russians."

2022-03-03,"Donations in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum are pouring into Ukraine as the war with Russia enters its second week.Since Moscow invaded on Feb. 24, over 102,000 cryptoasset donations, totaling $54.7 million, have gone to the Ukrainian government and Come Back Alive, an NGO providing support to the military, according to new data from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.Donations have also come in the form of nonfungible tokens and stablecoins like tether. Donations in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum are pouring into Ukraine as the war with Russia enters its second week.Since Moscow invaded on Feb. 24, more than 102,000 cryptoasset donations, totaling $54.7 million, have gone to the Ukrainian government and Come Back Alive, an NGO providing support to the military, according to new data from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The raise includes a single donation of $5.8 million from Gavin Wood, the founder of a lesser-known cryptocurrency called polkadot.Donations have picked up this week, with around 72,000 of these donations coming in the past two days. Thus far, the contributions consist of $18.2 million in ether, $17.2 million in bitcoin and $9.5 million in a mix of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, including an anonymous donation of $1 million in tether, a controversial token designed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.Accepting donations in crypto is new for the Ukrainian government. Up until Saturday, all donations had to travel via traditional payment channels, but on Feb. 26, the government decided to get creative.Twitter accounts belonging to the Ukrainian government began to solicit cryptoasset donations for the first time. The move came after the country's central bank cracked down on digital money transfers in connection with a nationwide declaration of martial law.Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have become more popular since they allow users to bypass financial institutions that might block payments to Ukraine.Elliptic says that the bitcoin, ethereum, tron, polkadot, dogecoin and solana addresses listed in the tweets have received over 96,000 cryptocurrency donations, with a total value of $46.7 million going directly to the government.""Cryptocurrency is particularly suited to international fundraising because it doesn't respect national boundaries and it's censorship-resistant — there is no central authority that can block transactions, for example in response to sanctions,"" said Elliptic's chief scientist, Tom Robinson.Donations of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, have also surged.One CryptoPunk NFT worth over $200,000 was sent to the Ukrainian government's ethereum account, and Elliptic says that a single transaction worth $1.86 million looks to have come from the sale of NFTs originally intended to raise funds for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Meanwhile, UkraineDAO has auctioned off an NFT of the Ukrainian flag for $6.5 million in ether, which makes it among the most expensive NFT ever sold. Elliptic says that the proceeds are to be donated to Come Back Alive.But even as cryptocurrencies open up new paths to cash for a country fighting off a major offensive, the numbers pale by comparison to the cash flowing into the country from international allies such as the U.S.In addition to the $350 million that the White House authorized in military aid to Ukraine, the Biden administration is asking Congress for $10 billion in immediate emergency aid to bolster humanitarian supplies, security forces, and the economies in Ukraine and its central European partners. Meanwhile, USAID has pledged another $54 million in humanitarian aid to Kyiv."
2022-03-03,"Ken Griffin, CEO of investment firm Citadel and a prominent crypto detractor, seems to have softened his stance on digital currencies.Griffin previously dismissed cryptocurrencies as ""a jihadist call"" against the dollar, but this week said that ""crypto has been one of the greatest stories in finance over the course over the last 15 years.""""The crypto market today has a market capitalization of about $2 trillion in round numbers, which tells you that I haven't been right on this call,"" he said in an interview with Bloomberg. In crypto, market capitalization is the value of all the coins that have been minted.Griffin — the No. 40 richest person in the world with a net worth of about $30.4 billion, according to Bloomberg — said that while he is still not completely sold on crypto, Citadel cannot ignore the space any longer.""I still have my skepticism, but there are hundreds and millions of people in this world today who disagree with that,"" he said. ""To the extent that we're trying to help institutions and investors solve their portfolio allocation problems, we have to give serious consideration to being a market maker in crypto.""He added that it is ""fair to assume"" that Citadel will begin to engage with cryptocurrencies ""over the months to come.""It's a major reversal for Griffin, who in 2017 told CNBC that bitcoin has ""many of the elements of the tulip bulb mania,"" referring to the period in the 1630s when the price of tulip bulbs skyrocketed before crashing.In the same interview, Griffin said he worried that crypto investors ""don't really understand what they're participating in"" and warned that ""bubbles tend to end in tears."" Last February, Griffin told CNBC that he doesn't ""spend much time thinking about cryptocurrencies.""In November, Griffin made headlines in the crypto space when he paid $43.2 million for a first-edition copy of the U.S. Constitution.

2022-03-03," Boku provides consumers a mobile method to pay for services like Netflix and Spotify without ever inputting a credit or debit card number. Covid led to a bump in revenue as people consumed more online and it forecasts a mobile wallets market reaching 60% of the global population by 2025.The company, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, sees web3 as a big opportunity for further gains in mobile pay, but it doesn't see cryptocurrency as a threat to its business model. In this weekly series, CNBC takes a look at companies that made the inaugural Disruptor 50 list, 10 years later.In a world where not everyone has a debit or credit card, Boku's mission for the past 13 years has been to provide consumers a way to pay for online services with only their phone numbers. The mobile payments company, founded in 2008, directly connects online bank accounts to phone numbers so that consumers can pay for services like Netflix and Spotify without ever inputting a credit or debit card number. And one of the biggest stories in fintech continues to evolve today.""The payment ecosystem is fragmenting quite a lot,"" said Boku CEO Jon Prideaux.While other former CNBC Disruptors such as Stripe and Square (now Block) ""are riding on the card rail,"" according to Prideaux, Boku's opportunity is in providing consumers access to the brands, products, and services they want, while helping merchants sell to consumers in the way many now prefer to pay. Prior to Boku, Prideaux worked at Visa Europe for 17 years on its e-commerce capabilities and card technology.

The identity division was the fastest-growing revenue source for the company, but Boku saw a much larger available market in mobile payments and Prideaux said specializing in the payments division gives it the best chance to compete against rivals from the ranks of financial giants and independent payment upstarts, including Worldpay from FIS, JPMorgan Chase's Paymentech, Rapyd and dLocal.With many people around the world stuck at home for the last two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and more content and services consumed digitally, the company saw a ""Covid bump"" in revenue and usage. It is business that Prideaux expects to be sticky. ""Once you've discovered [entertainment streaming services], you don't really cancel. So we've definitely had quite a lot of benefit from accelerated adoption, but it was against the background or something that was growing before and continues to grow now,"" he said.Boku's 2021 results showed revenue up 22%, year over year, to $69 million, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation) up by 31% to $20 million. Boku shares have risen roughly 60% since its first day of trading after a 2017 IPO — notable for being a U.S.-based start-up that went public in London — though like many tech stock stocks that boomed during the pandemic, its price has declined since last summer.Much of the growth in mobile wallets and payments are expected to come from outside of North America and Western Europe. There are 2.8 billion people using mobile wallets today, according to Boku's 2021 Mobile Wallets report, and it forecasts growth to 4.8 billion by 2025, representing 60% of the world's population, with the biggest gains in Southeast Asia.In August 2021, Boku launched M1ST, or ""Mobile First,"" a mobile payments network that standardizes options including WeChat Pay and Apple Pay into one network. Prideaux thinks the next big change in the mobile payments industry may come from the popularity of web3, also known as the metaverse. However, he isn't worried about the rise of cryptocurrencies, which fintechs including Block are heavily investing in. ""Crypto is a terrible method for payments on mobile,"" Prideaux said. ""It's incredibly slow. It's incredibly computer-intensive,"" he said.That doesn't mean crypto won't power a distinct payment ecosystem separate from mobile payments, though, and that is a factor he says Boku will continue to monitor.Sign up for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at companies like Boku before they go public, and founders like Prideaux who continue to innovate across every sector of the economy."
2022-03-04,"Can cryptocurrencies like bitcoin be used by Russia to avoid sanctions? That's one of the big questions that have been raised during the war with Ukraine.Experts point to the traceable nature of the blockchain and lack of liquidity as reasons that it would be difficult for Russians to use cryptocurrency to avoid sanctions.A debate has also been raging over whether bitcoin has finally taken up the status of ""digital gold."" The role of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has been a key talking point during Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the enacting of sanctions and subsequent financial market turmoil.And it has thrown up three big questions about how it is being used and what its future looks like. After its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been hit with a number of economic sanctions aimed at cutting the country off from the global financial system.Key Russian figures and financial institutions have been placed on a U.S. sanctions list that effectively prohibits American firms from doing business with them. Meanwhile, the United States, European allies and Canada have removed key Russian banks from an interbank messaging system called SWIFT, which hampers their access to global financial markets.The sanctions have caused the Russian ruble to plunge.This has led to a debate about whether cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, could be a way for those on sanctions lists to evade the restrictions.This is because bitcoin and other digital currencies are often decentralized, meaning they're not issued or controlled by a central entity like a central bank. When crypto is sent to other users, it does not go through the traditional route of financial plumbing. But there are a number of challenges.First, blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, is a public ledger of activity. It's therefore possible to track the movements of funds from one account to another quite easily. This doesn't make it a good tool for avoiding sanctions.""The biggest misconception about crypto remains that it is untraceable and is primarily used for nefarious purposes, which couldn't be further from the truth,"" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC.Meanwhile, there isn't enough liquidity for Russian oligarchs and companies to move their money around.""Liquidity in crypto is still a fraction of the global currency market, and hence moving large amounts of money using crypto is difficult,"" Ayyar said.Cryptocurrency exchanges will also be on high alert. Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProBitcoin just posted its worst week of the year. Here's where analysts see it heading next.These tech stocks have never been more compelling, Goldman Sachs saysBank of America says this chip stock is the best way to play the electric vehicle transition Bitcoin just posted its worst week of the year. Here's where analysts see it heading next.These tech stocks have never been more compelling, Goldman Sachs saysBank of America says this chip stock is the best way to play the electric vehicle transition ""Exchanges that operate with strong processes and codes of conduct will no doubt be doubly watchful at this moment for funds that have nefarious origins,"" Charles Hayter, CEO of data firm CryptoCompare, told CNBC.On Thursday, Brian Armstrong, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange and wallet Coinbase, backed up many of these points in a thread. He said that every U.S. business has to follow the law.""It doesn't matter if your company handles dollars, crypto, gold, real estate or even non financial assets. Sanctions laws apply to all US people and businesses,"" Armstrong said.""So it would be a mistake to think crypto businesses like Coinbase won't follow the law. Of course we will. This is why we screen people who sign up for our services against global watchlists, and block transactions from IP addresses that might belong to sanctioned individuals or entities, just like any other regulated financial services business.""However, there has been a spike in the volume of transactions from ruble into bitcoin and to tether, a so-called stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar, since Russia's attack on Ukraine, according to CryptoCompare. Hayter said this is a ""flight to the dollar by any means possible where crypto is but another route to preserve wealth,"" as the ruble has plunged.Coinbase's Armstrong said ""some ordinary Russians are using crypto as a lifeline now that their currency has collapsed.""Earlier this week, lawmakers including Senator Elizabeth Warren urged the Treasury Department to ensure that they could make sure crypto companies are compliant with sanctions on Russia. One U.S. government official said it's unlikely that Russia could evade sanctions using cryptocurrencies.""The scale that the Russian state would need to successfully circumvent all U.S. and partners' financial sanctions would almost certainly render cryptocurrency as an ineffective primary tool for the state,"" said Carol House, the director of cybersecurity for the National Security Council, during a webinar on Wednesday, Reuters reported. For years, proponents of bitcoin have been calling the digital currency ""digital gold."" The idea is that bitcoin is a store of value and could be a safe haven asset in times of turmoil, just like the yellow metal.However, that theory has unraveled in recent years, as bitcoin trading has been correlated to risk assets, in particular stocks.But as the war in Ukraine intensified this week, bitcoin saw a huge one day jump taking it above $44,000 off the lows for the year, prompting speculation that its time as a safe haven asset has come. Several experts disagreed.""We have read across a few different publications that BTC is regaining its status as a safe-haven. We completely disagree with this notion,"" Lux Thiagarajah, head of trading and account management at crypto financial services company BCB Group, said in a note on Thursday.""A safe haven is an asset that retains its value during times of market turbulence. Crypto has aggressively sold off since it was clear the Fed (U.S. Federal Reserve) were going to hike rates faster than anticipated which in turn saw stocks sell off. This is not the definition of a safe haven.""Luno's Ayyar said in the past week that bitcoin has ""de-correlated quite a bit from equities and gold, which is one positive indication around its use case as a safe haven."" He added that bitcoin will continue to mature, taking away market share from gold, but that narrative ""may still take more time to play out."" Cryptocurrency proponents often tout the underlying blockchain as a way to have more efficient and traceable transactions. One of the reasons is that there is no intermediary to move the money, unlike traditional financial transactions.But many cryptocurrencies still suffer from high fees and slow transaction speed. They haven't necessarily seen mass adoption for things like payments.However, during the war, Ukraine began to accept donations via cryptocurrencies to fund its military, among other things. Ukraine has raised over $50 million via cryptocurrencies, according to analytics firm Elliptic.Taking donations via traditional banking methods could be difficult, given the high cost of sending money abroad. It might also take a long time for Ukraine to receive money.That's where cryptocurrencies have an advantage, according to Garrick Hileman, visiting fellow at the London School of Economics.""When critical infrastructure is out or there are concerns about how quickly something can get through traditional banking system, as long as you have internet and a computing device you can transact. That has been one of the promises of crypto,"" Hileman said.Because the transactions are on a public ledger, Hileman said, you can to some extent to see where the money you send goes and how it is deployed after it is received.""Some of the original value propositions of cryptocurrencies are seeing validation,"" he added."
2022-03-04," Kraken is one of a handful of crypto exchanges avoiding an outright ban of Russian accounts.Jesse Powell, Kraken's co-founder and CEO, says the exchange is within the legal sanctions requirements but indiscriminate bans are unfair to average Russians, who might not support the country's invasion of Ukraine.""It's a pretty extreme measure, and it's far beyond turning off someone's access to their music streaming service, or their their photo sharing app,"" the CEO says. ""Shutting off someone's financial access is something we take very seriously.""  One of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges won't shut down Russian accounts unless the State Department orders it to do so, according to its CEO.Kraken CEO and co-founder Jesse Powell said the San Francisco-based company is within legal sanctions requirements and is working with law enforcement to make sure banned accounts don't slip through the cracks. But total bans are unfair to average Russians, who might not support the country's invasion of Ukraine, Powell said.""It's a pretty extreme measure, and it's far beyond turning off someone's access to their music streaming service, or their their photo sharing app,"" Kraken's CEO told CNBC's Crypto World in an interview. ""Shutting off someone's financial access is something we take very seriously.""The United States, U.K. and European Union have announced waves of penalties against Russia to pressure President Vladimir Putin into backing off from an attack on Ukraine. That includes cutting the country out of the widely used global payments communication system, SWIFT. Visa, Mastercard, major banks, and other conglomerates such as Nike and Apple have stopped doing business in Russia.Despite the restrictions, payment companies are still technically allowed to operate there, as long as the accounts don't pop up on a sanctions list. If the U.S. and NATO allies went a step further with country-wide bans, such as those on North Korea and Iran, Powell said the exchange would pivot and shut things down.""Where we are required to do so legally, we will freeze the accounts,"" he said. ""But as far as sanctioning individuals, we haven't seen that work very well... once you go to freeze someone's financial account, they're no longer able to pay their rent, pay their debts, buy food, and support their family."" Ukrainian officials have urged the industry to step in. Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov tweeted a plea to all major crypto exchanges to block addresses, and said ""it's ""crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians, but also to sabotage ordinary users.""Kraken competitors Binance, Coinbase and FTX are also still operating within Russia and, according to data firm Kakio, have seen more activity in Eastern Europe since the conflict began. Transactions in the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia hit their highest levels in months, suggesting increase demand amid the conflict, according to data from Kaiko.A spokesperson for Binance said the exchange was ""not going to unilaterally freeze millions of innocent users' accounts"" but is blocking the accounts of any individuals on sanctions lists, while ""ensuring that all sanctions are met in full,"" the spokesperson said.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said something similar Thursday night, and explained that the exchange was not ""preemptively"" banning all Russians from the platform.""We believe everyone deserves access to basic financial services unless the law says otherwise,"" Armstrong tweeted, adding that if the U.S. government decides to impose a ban, ""we will of course follow those laws.""Some in Congress have flagged the possibility of cryptocurrencies being used by Russia to get around sanctions. Elizabeth Warren and three other Democrats in the Senate wrote a letter to the Treasury Department asking for an explanation of how they're overseeing the industry, and its potential for dampening sanctions enforcement.The industry has pushed back on that, too. Kraken's Jesse Powell said it's a ""misunderstanding"" by those in Washington who ""don't understand how cryptocurrency works"" and ""don't understand how regulated the space already is.""""They have this perspective of ten years ago, when it was a very nascent technology,"" Powell said.

2022-03-04,"Russia's media regulator said Friday it will block access to Meta-owned Facebook in the country as it escalates pressure on media outlets and tech platforms amid its invasion of Ukraine.Last week, the agency placed partial restrictions on Facebook for the alleged violation of federal law.Facebook previously said it refused to comply with Russia's request to stop labeling or fact-checking state-affiliated media. Russia's media regulator said Friday it will block access to Meta-owned Facebook in the country as it escalates pressure on media outlets and tech platforms amid its invasion of Ukraine.The regulator said Facebook violated federal law by restricting access to accounts of several state-affiliated media outlets, according to a translated version of a statement. The move marks an escalation from earlier limits Russia placed on Facebook.Last week, the agency placed partial restrictions on Facebook for the alleged violation.At the time, Meta's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Russian authorities had ordered the platform to stop fact-checking and labeling content posted on Facebook by state-owned outlets like RT and Sputnik. Meta refused the request, he said.The regulator said Friday it's found 26 ""cases of discrimination against Russian media and information resources by Facebook"" since October 2020. ""Soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out,"" Clegg said in a statement on Twitter in response to Friday's blocking. ""We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organize for action.""Russia has escalated its crackdown on both traditional and social media as its war with Ukraine continues. Some companies like Twitter and Google have committed to labeling state-owned media and suspending advertising in Russia. Meanwhile, a new law that would allow Russian authorities to jail anyone who spreads ""fake"" news about its military drove the BBC to suspend the work of its journalists in the country.An independent service, GlobalCheck, appeared to show as of Friday afternoon that Twitter was unavailable on Russian ISPs. The Russian media regulator's site did not yet show any new actions against Twitter.A Twitter spokesperson said in a statement the company is aware of reports that its service was restricted for some in Russia, ""but we don't currently see anything significantly different from what we previously shared that would point to a block."" They pointed to a Feb. 26 tweet, where the company said it's ""aware that Twitter is being restricted for some people in Russia and are working to keep our service safe and accessible.""Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.WATCH: Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions spur increasing calls for crypto regulation: CNBC Crypto World"
2022-03-05,"The jig is up — we know you're cheating on your daily Wordle.Or, at least, it would certainly appear that a growing number of people have been looking online for answers to the popular five-letter word guessing game — possibly to avoid putting a stop to a winning streak.That's according to a recent study by Wordfinderx, a reference website for word games like Wordle and Scrabble, which used Google Trends data to determine that Google searches for the answer to Wordle's daily puzzle have nearly tripled ever since The New York Times acquired Wordle in January.The study found that searches for Feb. 15's ""AROMA"" and Feb. 19's ""SWILL"" daily Wordle solutions reached a 100 out of 100 on Google's search popularity scale, which compares search results on a topic and then rates them on a scale of 0 to 100 ""based on a topic's proportion to all searches on all topics,"" according to Google.In comparison, Jan. 4's ""SIEGE"" only reached a 1 on the same scale, while searches for the daily Wordle solution never topped 60 on Google's scale prior to The New York Times' purchase of the game on Jan. 31. In other words, based on the Google search trends, more and more people are turning to the internet for help solving their daily Wordle puzzle.Players have complained that Wordle has become more difficult to solve since it was acquired by The New York Times. However, there's been no real evidence to back up that theory, as multiple publications have pointed out. In fact, The New York Times has, so far, only removed some words from the list of possible solutions while actually replacing some harder words with easier ones, like swapping out ""AGORA"" for ""AROMA"".A simpler, perhaps more plausible, explanation for the uptick in players resorting to looking up the Wordle solution online could be that there are just more and more people playing the game.Wordle has generated a lot of buzz since it launched in late 2021 and then quickly went viral at the start of the new year. The total number of daily Wordle players jumped from 300,000 in January into the millions by February, with no signs of slowing down yet. Psychologists previously told CNBC Make It that the quick, daily game offers a ""bite-sized amount of fun"" and it pulls in players by giving them something to look forward to every day.Harder or not, there are still certain Wordle solutions that have perplexed players more than others, according to the Wordfinderx study, which found that ""SWILL"" and ""AROMA"" were the recent words that inspired the most players to cheat by looking up the answers online.The study also found New Hampshire had more Wordle cheaters than any other state, with ""SWILL"" being the word most likely to frustrate residents of the Granite State. Interestingly, a separate study by another word game resource called WordTips found that New Hampshire was among the fastest U.S. states at solving Wordle, with Portsmouth, New Hampshire ranking 8th among U.S. cities with the most efficient Wordle players.Rhode Island and Vermont tied for second place, with players there searching the most on days when ""CAULK"" and ""TACIT"" were the Wordle solutions.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: 'Bite-sized fun': The psychology behind your sudden Wordle obsessionWordle kind of rips off an old game show: A copyright lawyer explains why that’s OK"
2022-03-05,"  Currently less than 1% of fresh produce is grown through hydroponics systems versus open-field agriculture, but this segment is forecast by Mordor Intelligence to grow by nearly 11% yearly to about $600 million by 2025 and Walmart has invested $400 million in Plenty Unlimited.Vertical farming start-up Fifth Season is backed by billionaire Nicholas Pritzker's Tao Capital and planning to disrupt the $60 billion U.S. produce market through food partners include Sabra, Kroger, Shoprite and Giant Eagle.""The tech multiplier doesn't lift all boats but it is spreading in the heartland,"" says Congressman Ro Khanna of Silicon Valley. Next to the last steel mill in the poor industrial town of Braddock along the Monongahela River just nine miles from Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel Tower, a vertical farming business backed by billionaire Nicholas Pritzker's Tao Capital is sprouting as an agritech innovator.The start-up, founded in 2016 as RoBotany by MBA student Austin Webb and incubated at Carnegie Mellon University, is aiming to disrupt the $60 billion U.S. produce market. Now named the more consumer-friendly sounding Fifth Season, the emerging business is leveraging advanced technology, $75 million in venture capital, increased distribution, a planned new Columbus, Ohio, facility, and an expanded management team to score in the fast-growth vertical farming market. CEO Webb confidently projects Fifth Season could be a $15 million business in Pittsburgh within five years and $500 million through geographic expansion plans, and estimates sales will hit a double-digit revenue rate this year and a 600% revenue increase.   ""Our smart manufacturing facility improves the yield, taste and texture of the vegetables, and does that with 95% less water, 95% less land, and uses no pesticides or chemicals,"" said Webb, who is 33. Fifth Season's automated proprietary system grows fresh produce year-round indoors in vertical trays, relying on artificial intelligence, robotics and data to control light, water and nutrients, and harvest leafy greens. Currently less than 1% of fresh produce is grown through hydroponics systems versus open-field agriculture, but this segment is forecast by Mordor Intelligence to grow by nearly 11% yearly to about $600 million by 2025. ""There's tremendous runway as the price comes down and more reliable operations remove the risk,"" said Brian Holland, managing director of Cowen & Co. in New York.  ""It's a race to scale with potentially multiple winners who can prove the economic model for automatic, robotic growing,"" he added. ""Fifth Season is more advanced, if not the most advanced, in the market in marrying technology and robotics to grow vegetables indoors at a lower cost.""Fifth Season is competing in a capital intensive, highly fragmented market with more than 2,000, mostly smaller farms and a handful of larger scale players. Among the largest is San Francisco-based Plenty Unlimited, which recently inked $400 million in strategic funding from Walmart and plans to sell its fresh produce from its Compton facility at the retailer's California stores. Another major rival is AeroFarms in Newark, New Jersey, which scrapped a SPAC deal to go public in October 2021 and is continuing to build out capacity at a Danville, Virginia farm.  ""Market leadership is just a function of time and a function of capital,"" said Webb.Racing to build out its business and keep pace with competitors, Fifth Season plans to construct its second indoor growing farm in 2023, and is negotiating for a land parcel in Columbus, Ohio, near the John Glenn Airport. Through a partnership with hummus maker Sabra in December 2021, the company also has introduced a new product line of co-branded, grab 'n go salad kits, priced at $6 to $8. Distribution of its products are being expanded this March at more Giant Eagle outlets as well as Kroger and ShopRite across 10 states and 1,000 locations, with a goal of reaching 3,000 grocery stores in 2023. In its initial year of commercial operation in 2020, some 500,000 pounds of its produce were supplied to nearby restaurants and campus dining locations from its 60,000-square foot growing space on a half-acre of land.

More on Main Street say they do with Covid relief gone Fifth Season's growth spurt signals a new high-tech era for the former steel-making capital. Dozens of regional tech start-ups are emerging in Pittsburgh and throughout the former Rust Belt as blue-collar factory work transitions to technical jobs and older, industrial towns are rebooted.""The tech multiplier doesn't lift all boats but it is spreading in the heartland,"" said Congressman Ro Khanna of Silicon Valley, author of ""Dignity In A Digital Age.""""The factory workers and technicians know how to make things and have an extraordinary work ethnic and sense of community. They are defying past conventions,"" he said.Gearing up, Fifth Season expanded its leadership team in January, while employee count is expected to increase to 100 next year from 80 now.  Finance and tech veteran Brian Griffiths came on board as CFO from semiconductor company Skorpios Technologies with experience at Credit Suisse and Guggenheim Partners. Varun Khanna was hired as vice president of food products from leadership posts at Chobani and Sabra. Glenn Wells joined as senior vice present of sales and previously worked at Quaker Oats, Welch's and Dole.   Another prong in its growth strategy is a planned $70 million expenditure on a new Columbus vertical farm that is three times larger than the $27 million Braddock plant, including real estate development for land, a building and equipment. The company's highly automated farms only require 35 to 50 production workers. The Pittsburgh plant makes four million salad meals annually, while the larger central Ohio location is expected to produce 15 million. Fifth Season is working with economic development groups One Columbus and Jobs Ohio on the new location. The foundation for Fifth Season's game-changing business comes from the intellectual power at Carnegie Mellon University and Pittsburgh's tech entrepreneurial cluster in computer science, robotics and engineering. Webb developed a prototype in his last year of the MBA program and launched the business upon graduation with co-founder Austin Lawrence, an environmental scientist and mechanical engineer he met on campus.  A third co-founder, Webb's brother Brac, is CTO. He designed the production software. The system was stress-tested for two years in a converted steel mill on the south side of Pittsburgh before the Braddock farm started operations in 2020.    Webb was mentored by Dave Mawhinney, executive director of CMU's Schwartz Center for Entrepreneurship, who helped him connect with investors and role models such as serial entrepreneur Luis von Ahn, the Pittsburgh-based founder of Nasdaq-listed edtech company Duolingo.  He also introduced MBA student, Grant Vandenbussche, a former General Mills global strategy coordinator, who joined the team in 2018 as a business development manager and is now chief category officer. ""Fifth Season is a testament to CMU's ability to attract very talented young people and grow entrepreneurs through its MBA program,"" said Mawhinney. ""It's all about the network."" Even before graduating in 2017, Webb lined up capital from angel investors, most of them connected to CMU. The network effect also played out as Mawhinney introduced Webb to the Columbus-based VC firm Drive Capital, which seeded the start-up with $1 million in 2017 and led a $35 million round in 2019 as it came out of stealth mode, changed its name from RoBotany, and Drive partner Chris Olsen joined as a board member.""Chris has pushed us to be thoughtful about the market and to think bigger nationally, not just locally or regionally, and to build a long-lasting company and a new product line,"" said Vandenbussche.The $75 million it has raised to date from investors includes not only Pritzker's Tao Capital Partners in San Francisco but eight different investor groups that joined in during 2021.""Pittsburgh is coming together as an ecosystem. One of the reasons it's doubling down is because of its strengths in AI, machine learning and legacy with biosciences,"" said Kit Mueller, who heads community networking group RustBuilt and recently became vice president of crypto asset company Stronghold Digital Mining in Pittsburgh. No longer dependent on steel, iron, and its rivers as competitive advantages, the city is transitioning from gritty industries and robotics start-ups are crowding into the so-called Silicon Strip of former warehouses. This mid-sized city of 303,000, less than half its peak population of 677,000 in 1950, has emerged as a technology testbed for self-driving technology from Ford-invested Argo AI and Amazon-backed Aurora, and Uber's technology unit acquired by Aurora. It's also an anchor for R&D labs at Facebook, Apple, Google, Zoom, and Intel.  A lingering issue facing Midwestern start-ups is a shortage of venture capital. California, New York and Boston logged about two-thirds of $329.9 billion in start-up investments in 2021. This imbalance is beginning to shift toward specialized inland hubs as strongholds take shape such as Pittsburgh with robotics as well as Cleveland with biotech and Indianapolis with SaaS.Improved lifestyle amenities, increased opportunities and the lower costs of living are draws for millennial tech talent to inland hubs. The co-founders of Fifth Season, and many others, came to Pittsburgh to pursue entrepreneurship and have stayed. ""The only ones who don't like Pittsburgh are those who never came here and those who left but never came back,"" said Lynsie Campbell, a serial founder who bounced around New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco but returned home as a Pittsburgh-based partner with The Fund Midwest, and is a leader in city's venture capital and start-up sphere.

2022-03-05,"The age at which you claim Social Security plays a large part in determining the size of your monthly checks.But it turns out there are ways you can boost that benefit payout.Here's what you need to know about how you might be able to increase your monthly checks. Social Security benefits make up about 30% of elderly Americans' incomes, according to the Social Security Administration.For some beneficiaries, it can be 90% or more.Yet many people do not think of those earned benefits, and the monthly checks that come with them, as a personal financial asset, according to Social Security expert Larry Kotlikoff, author of a new book titled ""Money Magic: An Economist's Secrets to More Money, Less Risk and a Better Life.""The money you pay into the system is generally fixed, amounting to 12.4% of your earnings from work that are subject to Social Security taxes. Those taxes are split 50-50 between you and your employer, so you each pay 6.2%, up to a certain cap. In 2022, that tax is applied on up to $147,000 in wages. More from Advice and the Advisor:What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated Yet the money you may eventually get back from the program is not set in stone.If you claim at the earliest age you're eligible — 62 — you will receive permanently reduced benefits. If you instead claim at your full retirement age — generally age 66 to 67, depending on the year you were born — you will receive 100% of that benefit based on your work record. For each year you wait until age 70, you may increase your benefits by 8% through what is known as delayed retirement credits.However, there are other ways you may increase your benefits even after you claim, according to Kotlikoff. If you're between your full retirement age and 70 and are already receiving benefits, you can still stop your monthly checks now and restart them later in order for your benefits to start growing again.The bump-up you will receive is the delayed retirement credit for the time your benefits were suspended.But beware: If your spouse or children are receiving benefits based on your record, their checks will also stop. And their benefits will not grow during that time, with the exception of adjustments for inflation, Kotlikoff said. Alternatively, if you decide to claim but regret your decision, you may get a do-over through what is called a withdrawal of application.This is only available so long as it has been less than 12 months since your decision to claim was made. However, the catch is that you will need to repay all the benefits you received — including spousal or dependent benefits that may have gone to your family — in order to reverse your decision. What's more, you can only do this once in a lifetime. When Social Security retirement beneficiaries are still working, they may be subject to a retirement earnings test if they are below their normal retirement age.Benefits for people in that category whose earnings exceed a certain level will be reduced.In 2022, the annual exempt amount is $19,560 for people under retirement age. But for people who will reach their retirement age this year, the annual exempt amount is $51,960, which applies only to the months preceding your birthday. Notably, once you reach your retirement age, your monthly benefits are permanently increased to make up for the months when benefits were withheld, according to the Social Security Administration.These benefit reductions coupled with other taxes workers pay may erroneously discourage beneficiaries from returning to work, even after their impact diminishes, Kotlikoff writes. There's another reason why working longer may increase your benefits.Your Social Security benefits are calculated based on your covered earnings, or the jobs in which you paid taxes to the program.Generally, the Social Security Administration ranks all of your earnings for those years and takes the highest 35 values. This ranking is used to form your average indexed monthly earnings, which is then used to calculate the benefit amount you would receive if you claim at your retirement age. If you keep working, it is possible to increase your average indexed monthly earnings, and therefore the monthly benefits for which you are eligible.This is particularly important for people with inconsistent work records, or who took time out of the workforce and have low earnings or even zeroes for some years.That also particularly goes for high-earning older workers who earn above the annual cap for Social Security taxes ($147,000 in 2022).""By earning more, regardless of how old you are, you can replace these weak spots with a positive or higher value,"" Kotlikoff writes."

2022-03-07,"You can kick-start education funding with a larger, upfront contribution to a 529 savings plan.""The earlier you get money into a college plan, the more it will grow,"" said certified financial planner Mari Adam of Mercer Advisors.However, you'll generally pay a 10% penalty and income taxes on earnings if you tap the account for noneducation expenses. If you're eager to jump-start an education fund, you may consider a larger, upfront contribution to a 529 college savings plan.While the average account balance was $30,287 in 2021, according to the College Savings Plans Network, depositing and investing sooner may pay off, experts say.""The earlier you get money into a college plan, the more it will grow,"" said certified financial planner Mari Adam, senior wealth advisor at Mercer Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida. More from Advice and the Advisor:What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated A 529 plan allows you to grow money tax-free for qualified education expenses, such as college, vocational school or up to $10,000 of K-12 tuition per year. While there's no federal tax deduction for contributions, you may qualify for a write-off at the state level, depending on where you live, Adam said.Plan contribution limits vary by state, ranging from $235,000 to $550,000, according to Saving for College.Front-loading contributions may also avoid missing future deposits since only 37% of 529 plans currently receive automated savings. ""The best time to invest is when you have the money available,"" said John Loyd, a CFP and owner at The Wealth Planner in Fort Worth, Texas, pointing to upward stock market trends over time.Of course, there's a risk of overfunding a plan if the beneficiary doesn't need funds for education. You'll owe income taxes and a 10% penalty on earnings for nonqualified withdrawals. However, there may be other options for the money.""These plans have tremendous portability,"" said Philip Herzberg, a CFP and lead financial advisor at Team Hewins in Miami, explaining you can change the beneficiary to another family member or even a future child after they are born. Another technique, super funding a 529 plan, may appeal to wealthy families trying to reduce future estate taxes through gifting.You can give away $16,000 per gift in 2022 without owing federal gift tax. And many won't owe levies for larger amounts, either.""Most people don't have any kind of gift tax issues,"" Loyd said.That's because the federal estate and gift tax lifetime exemption is currently $12.06 million per person in 2022. But it reverts to $5 million adjusted for inflation in 2026 when part of former President Donald Trump's signature tax law sunsets.  If you expect your estate to be larger than either of those amounts when you die, you may avoid gift tax by ""super funding"" a 529 plan with five years of contributions at once, removing that money from your estate.For example, if you're single with an estate over the lifetime exemption, you may contribute $16,000 times five years or $80,000 in 2022 without paying gift tax (or $160,000 if your spouse agrees to ""split"" gifts.)""This is really a fabulous opportunity to get money into college plans,"" Adam said.And recent stock market volatility may present opportunities, Herzberg explained. ""You want to take advantage of those depressed prices with a lump sum investment."""
2022-03-07,"On Friday, Disney+ announced that it will soon offer a cheaper ad-supported subscription plan. It's the latest in a series of changes made by on-demand streaming service providers, including Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max and Hulu.Pricing for the new tier hasn't been announced yet, but it's assumed to be cheaper than Disney's current ad-free offering, which costs $7.99 per month. There is no launch date announced, either, but Disney says it will be available later this year.The move capitalizes on a growing market for cheaper ad-supported plans as Disney aims to grow its subscriber base of 118 million to better compete with Netflix, which has 222 million global subscribers, CNBC reported.

2022-03-08,"If you’re considering a Roth conversion, you'll need to plan for the upfront tax bite, financial experts say.Boosting your adjusted gross income can hurt eligibility for other write-offs or trigger higher future Medicare premiums.However, you can reduce levies through timing and other yearly tax planning strategies.    If you're considering a Roth conversion, your timing and yearly planning can significantly reduce the tax bite, financial experts say. The popular retirement savings strategy allows higher earners to skirt the income limits for Roth individual retirement account contributions. While the maneuver may kickstart tax-free growth, you'll owe levies on pretax deposits.And boosting your adjusted gross income may have other consequences, according to certified financial planner Ashton Lawrence at Goldfinch Wealth Management in Greenville, South Carolina. More from Advice and the Advisor:What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updated For example, you may lose eligibility for certain write-offs, such as the child tax credit or student loan interest deduction. And retirees may unknowingly trigger higher Medicare premiums, he said.Medicare Part B and Part D calculate monthly premiums with your modified adjusted gross income from two years prior, which means your 2022 income can cause higher costs in 2024.""That's a big one that slides under the radar,"" Lawrence said.However, there may be opportunities to help offset the upfront taxes and avoid some of these issues. ""Think of a Roth conversion as a juicy steak that you can cook how you want,"" said Bart Brewer, a CFP and instructor with Ken Zahn Inc. based in Santa Monica, California. ""There are lots of planning opportunities here if you do your homework."" One opportunity may be timing a Roth conversion with a stock market downturn, like the latest declines triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.""The silver lining of market volatility is the ability to pay less tax on Roth conversions,"" said Sean Michael Pearson, a CFP and associate vice president at Ameriprise Financial Services in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.  For example, if you have $10,000 in a pretax IRA and there's a 10% market drop, you'll convert $9,000 instead of $10,000, saving $220 in federal taxes if you're in the 22% marginal tax bracket, he said. If you're planning a Roth conversion, you may consider reducing adjusted gross income by contributing more to your pretax 401(k) plan, Lawrence suggested.You may also leverage so-called tax-loss harvesting, offsetting profits with losses, in a taxable account. If losses exceed gains, you can use up to $3,000 of capital losses per year to reduce regular income.And if you're considering a sizable charitable gift, you may try to send it the same year as the conversion, Brewer said, such as transfers to a donor-advised fund.  ""This strategy is golden if you are charitably inclined and can itemize,"" he added.Roth conversions may make sense in lower-earning years, such as when retirees who haven't started taking Social Security payments. ""In broad terms, that's most likely going to be the sweet spot,"" Lawrence said."
2022-03-08,"The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.25% at its meeting next week. It would be the first rate hike in three years.That will likely have a big impact on consumers, from loans and investments to savings, job prospects and prices for goods and services. Interest rates are almost undoubtedly going up this month, for the first time in three years.The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% next week to curb inflation, which is running at a 40-year high. Additional hikes are likely later this year.American households will feel that policy impact in many ways, both positive and negative, according to financial advisors.""The Fed raising rates touches pretty much every single corner of the economy,"" said Andy Baxley, a certified financial planner at The Planning Center in Chicago. Higher interest rates translate to costlier financing for borrowers.That's true for mortgages, student loans, auto loans, credit cards, margin loans on investment accounts and other types of debt.   ""The higher rates go, it's harder and harder to be a borrower,"" Baxley said. Let's say a consumer wants to buy a $500,000 home; they get a $400,000 mortgage at a 30-year fixed rate. They would pay about $80,000 more over the loan's term and about $200 more each month with a 4% mortgage rate relative to 3%, for example, Baxley said.Income qualifications and down payments increase with mortgage rates — meaning new home buyers may want to speed up their search so they don't get priced out of the market, according to Cathy Curtis, CFP, founder of Curtis Financial Planning in Oakland, California.Consumers shopping for a new car should also expedite that process to avoid pricier car loans, Curtis said. It may also be a good time for investors with margin loans on their brokerage accounts to focus on paying down that debt, she added.

Higher interest rates will likely pressure growth stocks, according to financial advisors. Such stock is issued by companies that have the potential to grow at an above-average rates relative to the broader market.These firms (the classic ones being the big technology companies) thrive when interest rates are low because they can invest in innovative projects more cheaply, Baxley said.""It could be a rough road ahead for growth stocks,"" he said.Investors may inadvertently be overweight in growth stocks due to big returns in that portion of their portfolio. They should allocate more money to value stocks — the easiest way being the purchase of a value-focused mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, Curtis said.Bonds will also likely lose money in the short term. That's because bond prices move opposite to interest rates. The dynamic is more pronounced for bond funds with a long duration (those with bonds maturing in 10 years vs. 1 year, for example), advisors said.""If you have to pay for college or buy a house in a year, you shouldn't be thinking, 'I can't lose money in bonds,'"" said Ted Jenkin, CFP, co-founder of oXYGen Financial in Atlanta.However, in the long term, higher interest rates ultimately mean higher returns for bond investors; new bonds are issued at higher yields that correspond to prevailing interest rates. The national average interest rate for savings accounts is a paltry 0.06%, according to a March 2 poll conducted by Bankrate.But consumers will likely see higher bank-account interest if the Federal Reserve acts. Online banks offering high-yield accounts tend to pay higher rates than traditional banks, according to advisors. Rates on other savings accounts like certificates of deposit would also rise.""It's important to do some rate shopping if you're trying to enjoy those gains,"" Baxley said.The gains likely won't be immediate, though. It generally takes several months to a year for banks to raise rates on savings accounts, according to Jenkin. The reason the U.S. central bank raises interest rates is to cool the economy to tame inflation.If the policy has its desired effect, consumers should see recent rapid price increases for food, clothing, and other goods and services begin to moderate.  This knock-on effect stems from higher borrowing costs. Costlier financing translates to less investment from consumers and businesses, which cools demand in the economy and tames prices. However, lower demand may impact jobs and wages in certain parts of the economy, Baxley said.High demand for workers and a limited supply of labor have led to record job openings and fast wage growth in recent months.""I think people have gotten used to it being the first worker-friendly hiring climate in a while,"" he said. That dynamic may shift with higher interest rates, he said."
2022-03-08,"The average gas price in the U.S. surged to over $4 per gallon this week, as the invasion of Ukraine led to a new all-time high for the cost of gas. These prices are expected to remain elevated, possibly all summer — or at least until the supply of oil catches up with demand.Western countries have been avoiding Russian oil purchases due to the conflict in Eastern Europe, which, along with growing post-pandemic demand, has choked the global supply of crude oil.Regular-grade gas prices reached $4.173 on Tuesday — a 55.4 cent increase from a week ago, according to the American Automobile Association. This increase is in addition to the 40% year-over-year increase in gas prices as of the end of January. The cost of gas jumped by more than $1 per gallon in 2021, on average.However, it's worth noting that while gas prices are steadily climbing, these figures do not account for inflation. In terms of actual cost to the consumer, current prices are similar to what they were in the 2010s, when retail gas prices last reached $4 per gallon. Over the years, fuel-efficiency for passenger vehicles has also increased by a few miles per gallon, so that might also mitigate some of the cost, too. The U.S. imports 8% of its oil from Russia, according to Reuters. Compared to the European Union (EU), which imports 27% of its crude oil from Russia, according to 2019 E.U. data, the U.S. is much less dependent on Russian oil. However, even with less direct exposure to Russian oil exports, Americans are still feeling the pinch.""The problem is that oil has been and remains a global market,"" says Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for Gas Buddy. ""When oil is getting choked off — a kink in the hose, so to speak — that impacts everyone that consumes oil, as well as the price.""And gas prices tend to be more volatile than other commodities, as they're particularly sensitive to fluctuations in supply and demand. The price gains in 2021 are no exception to this price sensitivity: Oil production briefly shut down early in the pandemic, and has yet to catch up with growing demand. Supply chain issues have been another factor, as well as seasonality. Gas prices tend to go up during the summer, when people typically travel more. In over 10 states, average retail gas prices are currently over $4.346, including California, which is averaging $5.444 at the pump. Because of that, many consumers are likely wondering whether these elevated prices will last. ""For now, 98 or 99% of Americans don't have to worry about $6 or $7 [per gallon], or some of those apocalyptic numbers,"" says De Haan, who argues that such an increase would require unforeseen events to further limit the global supply of oil, like oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico being damaged by hurricanes, for example.He expects the rate of price increases to level off, while remaining elevated for the rest of 2022, barring a big event or change in the crude oil market.""We're now predicting a yearly national average of $3.99. I think that's pretty likely to stick,"" says De Haan. He says that prices at the pump reflect the current prices of about $115 for a barrel of oil. But if oil prices jump up by $20 per barrel  — something not seen since 2008 — then the pace of retail gas price increases will accelerate again.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Billionaire Ken Griffin softens his anti-crypto stance: 'I haven't been right on this call'"
2022-03-09,"LimeWire, the defunct file-sharing website, is set to relaunch in the form of a marketplace for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs.The controversial service was shut down in 2010 following a lengthy legal battle with the Recording Industry Association of America.At its height, LimeWire was one of the most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing websites. LimeWire, the defunct file-sharing website, is set to make a comeback.The controversial service was shut down back in 2010, after a lengthy legal battle with the Recording Industry Association of America over allegations of music piracy. A federal judge found the platform caused copyright infringement on a ""massive scale.""At its height, LimeWire was one of the most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing websites, allowing users to download music and other content online free of charge. The likes of LimeWire, BitTorrent and Napster were eventually succeeded by subscription-based streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix.More than a decade since it closed down, LimeWire is making a comeback — but with a twist.The service will relaunch in May as a marketplace for trading nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, digital assets that keep a record of ownership for virtual items on the blockchain.Austrian brothers Julian and Paul Zehetmayr bought LimeWire's intellectual property and other assets last year. They say they've been planning to bring the platform back ever since.The new LimeWire will focus on music, letting users buy and trade rare items such as limited editions, unreleased demos and digital merchandise. The platform will list prices in U.S. dollars, rather than crypto, and users will be able to purchase tokens using credit cards. Its payment functionality has been developed in partnership with the start-up Wyre.The company is counting on a more accessible approach to NFTs, as well as an advisory board that includes the manager of rap group Wu-Tang Clan, Tareef Michael, to attract users.""The issue with the NFT market is that most platforms are decentralized,"" Julian Zehetmayr told CNBC. ""If you look at bitcoin, all the exchanges are making it really easy to buy, trade and sell bitcoin. There's no one really doing the same in the NFT space.""""We've obviously got this great mainstream brand that everybody's nostalgic about,"" he added. ""We thought we needed to build a real mainstream user experience as well.""So far, LimeWire's revival has been funded with money the Zehetmayrs raised through the sale of their previous ventures. Their software firm Apilayer, for example, was bought by American holding company Idera last year.The brothers say they plan to raise additional capital through the launch of a LimeWire token, which will initially be sold to a select few investors ahead of a public sale later down the line. The token will grant holders the ability to vote on changes to LimeWire's policies as well as which artists are featured in its music charts. The Zehetmayrs say they're also considering a venture capital financing round later this year. NFTs took off in a big way in 2021, with trading in the tokens reaching billions of dollars. The market has attracted everyone from crypto enthusiasts to celebrities, with a popular range of digital collectibles called the Bored Ape Yacht Club even making an appearance on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.""Proponents of NFTs say they solve a key issue with the modern internet: namely, the unfettered distribution of media on the web, and a decline in compensation for artists and creators.However, others criticize the speculative nature of NFTs, which are often bought with the intention of flipping them at a higher price, as well as the number of scams in the space.Julian said there are ""lots of parallels"" between the NFT market today and LimeWire in the past, adding both are ""kind of a Wild West.""""We're trying to be a more mature platform and professionalize everything, just like Coinbase or other exchanges would do for crypto assets,"" he said.LimeWire isn't the first decentralized file-sharing service to turn to the world of cryptocurrencies. Rival company BitTorrent was acquired by crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun's start-up Tron in 2018."
2022-03-09,"U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday calling on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies.The measures focus on six key areas: consumer protection, financial stability, illicit activity, U.S. competitiveness, financial inclusion and responsible innovation.The Biden administration also wants to explore a digital version of the dollar. U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday calling on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies.It's a long-awaited directive that has had the crypto industry on edge, not least due to growing regulatory concern around the world surrounding the nascent digital asset market.There had been reports of a divide between White House officials and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen leading to delays in the policy rollout.The crypto market got wind of the executive order overnight after the Treasury accidentally put out a since-deleted statement calling it ""historic"" and releasing some of the details ahead of time.The order was finally signed Wednesday. It calls on federal agencies to take a unified approach to regulation and oversight of digital assets, according to a White House fact sheet. Here are the key things to know. The measures announced Wednesday will focus on six key areas:Consumer and investor protectionFinancial stabilityIllicit activityU.S. competitiveness on a global stageFinancial inclusionResponsible innovationProtecting consumers is an important part of the directive. There have been countless stories of investors falling for crypto scams, or losing huge sums of money through cyberattacks on exchanges or users themselves.The Biden administration is calling on the Treasury to assess and develop policy recommendations on crypto. It also wants regulators to ""ensure sufficient oversight and safeguard against any systemic financial risks posed by digital assets."" While policymakers have been keen to downplay any systemic risks resulting from crypto, there have been increasing concerns over the role played by stablecoins. These are digital tokens that are meant to be pegged to the value of existing currencies like the U.S. dollar.Tether, the world's largest stablecoin with $80 billion in circulation, has attracted the ire of regulators over claims its token is not sufficiently backed by dollars held in reserve. Tether says its coin is fully backed, however the makeup of its reserves includes short-term debt obligations like commercial paper, not just cash.The topic of stablecoins was notably absent from the White House's announcement Wednesday, though Yellen has made clear she wants to see Congress introducing regulation for the sector. Another key area Biden's executive order focuses on is rooting out illegal activity in the crypto space.The president has called for an ""unprecedented focus of coordinated action"" from federal agencies in mitigating illicit finance and national security risks posed by cryptocurrencies. He is also urging international collaboration on the issue.

It's a more subtle point, but Biden also dropped a mention of the sheer energy cost baked into digital currencies like bitcoin. He wants the government to study ways to make crypto innovation more ""responsible,"" reducing any negative climate impacts. Bitcoin relies on a mechanism known as proof of work to confirm transactions and generate new units of currency. A decentralized network of computers competes to solve complex math puzzles in order to mine the cryptocurrency. The more computing power a miner has, the higher their chances of being rewarded in new bitcoin.That has raised alarm bells for policymakers around the world, with China even banning crypto mining completely last year. That move led to an exodus of crypto miners from the country to the U.S. and other countries, such as Kazakhstan. Part of the language in the White House announcement focuses on giving the U.S. a competitive edge over other countries when it comes to crypto development. This is especially significant now that China has effectively banned cryptocurrencies.Biden has tasked the Department of Commerce with ""establishing a framework to drive U.S. competitiveness and leadership in, and leveraging of digital asset technologies."" Several crypto industry figures have called for such action, including the bosses of Coinbase, Kraken and the Winklevoss twins' Gemini exchange.The Blockchain Association, an organization that represents multiple well-known crypto companies, said Wednesday that Biden ""has the opportunity to ensure America remains the global leader for technological innovation for years to come."" Finally, the Biden administration also wants to explore a digital version of the dollar.It comes as China has led the charge toward central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, with more and more people using smartphones to make payments and handle their finances.Biden isn't saying whether the U.S. should launch its own digital currency. Rather, he's calling on the government to place ""urgency"" on research and development of a potential CBDC.The Federal Reserve last year began work on exploring the potential issuance of a digital dollar. The central bank released a long-awaited report detailing the pros and cons of such virtual money, but didn't take a position yet on whether it thinks the U.S. should issue one.While CBDCs could rapidly speed up the settlement of payments, policymakers are evaluating a number of issues around financial stability and privacy. Delivery of the new policy agenda removes a key source of uncertainty for an industry that has already been rocked by numerous regulatory hiccups and scandals.Earlier this year, crypto start-up BlockFi was hit with a record $50 million fine by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it violated securities laws with its retail lending product. The penalty was part of a larger $100 million settlement which included payments to 32 states.Coinbase has similarly run into trouble with the watchdog, though it managed to avoid punishment. The SEC threatened Coinbase with legal action over a product similar to BlockFi's which offered users interest payments on their crypto holdings. The company subsequently dropped plans for the service.""This is a watershed moment for crypto, digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the 1996/1997 whole of government wakeup to the commercial internet,"" Jeremy Allaire, CEO of crypto firm Circle, said on Twitter.Crypto investors appeared to agree. Prices of bitcoin surged above $42,000 Wednesday on optimism over the U.S. executive action.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that the move by President Biden was an executive action."
2022-03-09,"Plenty of celebrity and tech icons have hopped on the Bitcoin train. Don't count Bill Gates among them.In a resurfaced interview from February 2021, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder told Bloomberg Technology that he was wary of the frenzy over Bitcoin, particularly because the value of the cryptocurrency could be swayed by something as simple as a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.""Elon has tons of money, and he's very sophisticated, so I don't worry that his Bitcoin will randomly go up or down,"" Gates said. ""I do think people get brought into these manias who may not have as much money to spare, so I'm not bullish on Bitcoin.""He added, ""If you have less money than Elon, you should probably watch out.""Musk — the world's richest person, with a net worth of $233 billion, according to Forbes — is notably a Bitcoin fan, tweeting about it as recently as Wednesday morning. But Gates said his fellow tech billionaire was merely an example of why he's turned off by everyday Bitcoin use.Specifically, Gates said, he's primarily concerned about the lack of regulation around the cryptocurrency. He highlighted two of the main risks associated with Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency: They're decentralized, and they can be highly volatile.""[Bitcoin] happens to promote anonymous transactions,"" Gates said. ""They're not reversible transactions.""Gates said that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation actually ""does a lot in terms of digital currency,"" but only when ""you can see who is making the transaction."" He said ""digital money is a good thing,"" especially when it comes to funding poorer countries and getting ""money out to their citizens very, very efficiently.""The good news for Gates is that regulation may be coming. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed an executive order encouraging federal agencies like the U.S. Treasury to develop new crypto-related policy recommendations — with an eye on addressing consumer protection, financial stability, illicit activity, U.S. competitiveness, financial inclusion and responsible innovation.Those are important areas: Crypto experts often warn that altcoins, in their current state, are at a high risk for fraud — and that they can gain and lose value very quickly, making them deeply unreliable as investments.""Be very careful about how much you allocate and understanding what you an tolerate,"" Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth, told CNBC Make It last year.

2022-03-10,"Trading in nonfungible tokens hit $17.6 billion last year, an increase of 21,000% from 2020, according to a report from Nonfungible.com.NFTs entered mainstream consciousness in a big way, with celebrities and major companies increasingly warming to the market.People also got better at making money from NFTs, generating a total $5.4 billion in profits through sales of the tokens in 2021. Sales of nonfungible tokens jumped to more than $17 billion in 2021, according to a new report from NFT data company Nonfungible.com.The study, developed with BNP Paribas-owned research firm L'Atelier, said trading in NFTs hit $17.6 billion last year, reflecting an eye-watering 21,000% surge from 2020's total of $82 million.NFTs are tradable assets that keep track of who owns a certain digital item — say, a work of art, or video game avatar — on the blockchain. They entered mainstream consciousness in a big way last year.A token representing a collage by the digital artist Beeple sold for a record $69 million at a Christie's auction, while popular collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club have lured celebrity buyers from Jimmy Fallon to Snoop Dogg.""We've seen exponential growth over the past year,"" Gauthier Zuppinger, co-founder of Nonfungible.com, told CNBC. Nonfungible.com's number for total NFT transactions in 2021 is lower than some other estimates. An earlier projection from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis put the figure at more than $40 billion.Zuppinger says this is down to the company's own methodology for measuring legitimate volumes of NFT trades. The Nonfungible.com data rules out transactions involving bots and wash trading, a practice where investors simultaneously buy and sell an asset to artificially inflate market activity.While proponents believe NFTs to be a valuable way of proving ownership of digital content, critics say the market has attracted predatory behavior. Participants are often encouraged to speculate on prices, and there's evidence emerging of their growing use for money laundering and other nefarious activities. More than 2.5 million crypto wallets belonged to people holding or trading NFTs in 2021, according to Nonfungible.com's research, up from just 89,000 a year earlier. The number of buyers rose to 2.3 million from 75,000.People also got better at making money from NFTs, according to the report, with investors generating a total of $5.4 billion in profits from sales of NFTs last year. Over 470 wallets managed to make profits in excess of $1 million, Nonfungible.com said.The most popular category of NFTs was collectibles, which accounted for $8.4 billion worth of sales. Gaming NFTs such as Axie Infinity represented the second-largest category, racking up $5.2 billion in sales.There was also a shift in focus later in the year to the so-called metaverse, with sales of digital land and other projects in the space reaching $514 million. Hype around the metaverse — proposed shared spaces in which users can interact with virtual objects and each other — gathered steam after Facebook's rebrand to Meta and Nike's purchase of RTFKT, which makes virtual sneakers. Going forward, Zuppinger doesn't expect the overall value of NFT transactions to rise as dramatically this year. Volumes have averaged around $687 million per week so far in 2022, he said, slightly up from an average of $620 million a week in the fourth quarter of 2021.""What is interesting is that we are seeing less people, less buyers, less sales,"" Zuppinger said.""The global community may have decreased because of speculation and a loss of interest in collectibles. But the global market is still really high and the value of some of these assets has continued to increase.""Zuppinger predicts more large companies and financial institutions will enter the market, while more speculative assets start to disappear. A number of big brands, including Visa and Nike, jumped on the NFT bandwagon in 2021."
2022-03-10,"Cryptocurrencies and other related investments like NFTs pose ""significant risks"" to 401(k) investors, the U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday.The agency warned employers to proceed with extreme care before adding them to a retirement plan, since doing so may breach their legal obligations.Financial companies have been marketing crypto to 401(k) plans in recent months, the bureau said. Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and other digital assets like non-fungible tokens, pose ""significant risks and challenges"" to 401(k) investors, including fraud, theft and financial loss, the U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday.The labor agency warned that employers that add crypto investments to their company 401(k) plans may easily run afoul of their legal obligations to workers who are plan participants.That counsel comes as financial services firms have begun marketing such investments as retirement-plan options in recent months, playing off growing popularity, the bureau said.More from Personal Finance:Here's what to know about managing your debt in retirementRetirees likely shielded from inflation hit on some expenses'Nowhere to hide' for consumers as inflation hits food, gas, housing""At this early stage in the history of cryptocurrencies ... the U.S. Department of Labor has serious concerns about plans' decisions to expose participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies or related products, such as NFTs, coins and crypto assets,"" Ali Khawar, acting assistant secretary at the Employee Benefits Security Administration, wrote Thursday.Employers who offer a 401(k) plan have a fiduciary duty relative to the investments they make available. That legal duty requires them to prudently select investments and monitor them on an ongoing basis.This duty has been the crux of a flurry of 401(k) lawsuits filed over the past decade or so, which have alleged workers lost money due to excessive costs and losses from unwise fund choices.Relative to crypto in 401(k) plans, the Labor Department outlined several risks and challenges in a compliance memo on Thursday. Crypto is speculative, volatile and hard to value, and it may be challenging for investors to make an informed investment decision, according to the bureau. Other properties — like losing the asset forever in the event of forgetting a password — also pose hazards, the agency said.Regulation may also change swiftly, the Labor Department said. President Joe Biden on Wednesday issued an executive order calling on the government to examine crypto's risks and benefits. However, many crypto proponents viewed the order positively.""The big question coming into the executive order was whether it was going to be balanced, whether it was going to talk about both the risks and the opportunities of crypto,"" Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told CNBC. ""It's pretty close to the outcome we were all hoping for."""

2022-03-11,"Crypto firms in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are being deluged with requests to liquidate billions of dollars of virtual currency as Russians seek a safe haven for their fortunes, company executives and financial sources said.Some clients are using cryptocurrency to invest in real estate in the UAE, while others want to use firms there to turn their virtual money into hard currency and stash it elsewhere, the sources said. Crypto firms in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are being deluged with requests to liquidate billions of dollars of virtual currency as Russians seek a safe haven for their fortunes, company executives and financial sources said.Some clients are using cryptocurrency to invest in real estate in the UAE, while others want to use firms there to turn their virtual money into hard currency and stash it elsewhere, the sources said.One crypto firm has received lots of queries in the past 10 days from Swiss brokers asking to liquidate billions of dollars of bitcoin because their clients are afraid Switzerland will freeze their assets, one executive said, adding that none of the requests had been for less than $2 billion.""We've had like five or six in the past two weeks. None of them have come off yet – they've sort of fallen over at the last minute, which is not rare - but we've never had this much interest,"" the executive said, adding that his firm normally receives an inquiry for a large transaction once a month.""We have one guy – I don't know who he is, but he came through a broker – and they're like, 'we want to sell 125,000 bitcoin'. And I'm like, 'what? That's $6 billion guys'. And they're like, 'yeah, we're going to send it to a company in Australia',"" the executive said.Dubai, the Gulf's financial and business centre and a growing crypto hub, has long been a magnet for the world's ultra-rich and the UAE's refusal to take sides between Western allies and Moscow has signalled to Russians that their money is safe there.One real estate broker, whose company has partnered with a cryptocurrency service to help people buy property, said: ""We've been seeing a lot of Russians and even Belarusians coming to Dubai and bringing whatever they can bring, even in crypto."" A financial source in the UAE confirmed that Russians were buying property in Dubai, using crypto as a way of getting their money out of other jurisdictions and into the Gulf state.Cryptocurrency exchanges have said, while giving few details, that they are blocking the accounts of Russians sanctioned by the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special operation."" Major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance say they are taking steps to ensure that crypto is not used as a vehicle to evade sanctions, and that they collaborate with law enforcement on the issue.Still, as crypto offers users a high degree of anonymity, European countries such as Germany and Estonia have this week called for tighter oversight to snuff out any loopholes that could allow sanctions busting.Three Western diplomats said they were increasingly alarmed by the number of Russians who in recent weeks were seeking a refuge in the UAE for their fortunes, including in property, and were wary that some could be acting on behalf of those under sanctions.Two of the diplomats said they were sceptical that the UAE would crack down on Russian wealth in the Gulf state, which they said was predominantly held in Dubai, citing the country's neutral stance in the conflict.A third said they hoped the UAE, which is also a gold trading hub, understood the implications for its reputation and would take action.The UAE was put on a ""grey list"" this month for increased monitoring by financial crime and money laundering watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).The FATF cited risks in certain industries, including real estate agents and precious metals dealers. Dubai adopted a virtual assets law this week and established a regulator. The UAE's regulator said it was close to issuing regulations and has consulted on money laundering risks in the sector.The Dubai government's media office and the UAE central bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The UAE's Foreign Ministry said it had no further comment beyond previous statements that the government has a ""strong commitment"" to working with FATF on areas for improvement in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime. Some experts say the relative transparency of cryptocurrency transactions, which are recorded on the blockchain ledger that underpins bitcoin and other tokens, makes large-scale sanctions evasion difficult.The U.S. Treasury said on Monday that sanctions-busting using crypto was ""not necessarily practicable"", and called for vigilance from companies in the industry.Two sources familiar with the matter said UAE companies had reputational concerns about doing business with Russians, but felt the state's abstention at the U.N. Security Council, when Russia vetoed a resolution condemning its invasion of Ukraine, was a signal they should not impose restrictions on Russians.The UAE, which has deepened ties with Russia over the years, has not matched sanctions imposed by Western nations and its central bank has not issued any guidance regarding the measures.Dubai, an attractive tourism destination, has long been popular with Russians, who were among the top visitors and purchasers of real estate even before the war and ensuing sanctions threw the Russian economy into turmoil.Apurv Trivedi of Healy Consultants, which advises on setting up businesses, including crypto companies, said they had definitely been getting more interest from Russian clients.""They're basically trying to protect themselves against the inflationary pressures that are happening against the Russian currency. So crypto has been a very good exit for them to manage the risks that they're facing,"" Trivedi said. ""It's a good liquidity provider for them.""Healy's Sami Fadlallah said a lot of the money coming from Russia has been moving into Dubai's real estate, citing both industry talk and their company's experience.""People parking their money in dozens of apartments in the Marina, Downtown,"" Fadlallah said.""We've seen a lot of Russians hedging their bets against the devaluation of the rouble by moving a lot of assets into crypto. And the UAE is relatively loose in terms of its regulation and authorities over transferring crypto here."""

There's a raft of other, smaller digital tokens, too.Crypto backers say it remains early earnings for the industry — bitcoin itself has only been around since January 2009. Still, crypto startups are attracting billions of dollars of venture capital.At the same time, the burgeoning asset class remains volatile, and regulators like Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler have warned about its ""highly speculative"" nature and the lack of investor protection. The outgoing chair of the U.K.'s financial regulator also has warned about pump-and-dump schemes in certain digital tokens.Among crypto's detractors, billionaire businessman Charlie Munger, a longtime partner of Warren Buffett and a Berkshire Hathaway vice chair, has also been critical of digital currencies and their volatility. In February, he said he wishes the U.S. had banned them. Buffett is no fan either, calling bitcoin in 2018 ""rat poison squared."" Others have likened bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme.

I own 32 different positions, including equity FTX itself,"" O'Leary said while disclosing he's a paid spokesperson for the cryptocurrency exchange, founded by 30-year-old billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.""The whole point is, you don't know who is going to win. Is Ethereum going to win? Is solana going to win? Is it Helium or is it Avalanche? I own them all,"" said O'Leary, who is a co-host of ""Shark Tank"" and makes other venture capital investments. He's also the founder and chairman of O'Shares ETFs.O'Leary's comments Friday come two days after President Joe Biden signed an executive order that directs the U.S. government to analyze the cryptocurrency industry. The administration says the order's goal is to both address risks while ""harnessing the potential benefits of digital assets and their underlying technology.""  ""It wasn't an all out ban, so that's good news,"" O'Leary said. However, he expressed concerns about the way Biden's directive includes an emphasis on climate risks associated with cryptocurrency.The act of mining bitcoin — which, in practice means running computers to verify transactions across the blockchain network — requires a lot of power. As a result, critics have lamented the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining.O'Leary said he's invested in at least one private bitcoin mining facility. However, he said he sold his positions in publicly traded bitcoin mining firms after Biden's executive order.Disclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to ""Shark Tank."""

2022-03-12,"Basketball Hall of Famer Grant Hill spoke with CNBC to discuss his brand deal with Philips, real estate and sports ownership.After all these years, even though his net worth is estimated to be $250 million, Hill says he's still ""paranoid"" about losing his money.He also prefers to invest in real estate. ""I believe in hard assets, real assets,"" Hill told CNBC. Grant Hill, the former NBA superstar and Duke Blue Devils icon, amassed over $100 million in career earnings. He has invested in several huge real estate projects, including a $5 billion development in Atlanta. He has an ownership stake in an NBA team and has a new partnership with multinational conglomerate Philips.Now, he's estimated to have a net worth of $250 million.But the 1994 Detroit Pistons first-round pick is still anxious about money — a mindset that persists from his days on the NBA court.""I was always thinking about when the game was over,"" Hill said about how he would budget during his playing days, with an eye on life after retirement. ""And I think that served me well.""Hill, 49, spoke to CNBC on Tuesday to discuss his new promotion arrangement with Philips' razor products around the 2022 NCAA men's basketball tournament, which starts March 17. He also works as a basketball analyst for Turner Sports' NBA and NCAA games.The interview was supposed to last only 15 minutes, but ended up stretching beyond 45 minutes as Hill discussed his investments, his continued involvement in the NBA and his unending curiosity about business in general.Here's how Hill navigated his finances and built a promising business portfolio off the court. After he was drafted, one of Hill's most notable decisions was electing not to hire a sports agent to negotiate deals. Hill said he doesn't believe in paying an agent a percentage of his contracts to talk on his behalf. Basketball agents can charge up to 4% to players to settle contracts and earn more if they lure brand deals to clients. Hill, who played for four teams over the course of 19 NBA seasons, recalled his first contract was an eight-year $45 million deal in 1994. That was negotiated by attorney Lon Babby, who had experience as the Baltimore Orioles general counsel and became Phoenix Suns president of basketball operations.""Essentially, we're CEOs of our own companies,"" Hill said, referring to professional athletes. ""And CEOs don't typically hire agents and pay them a percentage. They work with lawyers, and they have attorneys that help them negotiate and vet deals for you. And to protect your interest in contracts. So, I went that route with representation.""Babby, who charged Hill an hourly rate, helped negotiate a $93 million deal with the Orlando Magic in 2000 and set up a marketing division that secured deals from brands such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola's Sprite. Sports apparel company FILA signed Hill to a lifetime deal in 2018. By taking control of his business early in his career, Hill said, he learned by ""sitting with the executive leadership team, going over marketing campaigns — visiting ad agencies to develop a strategy."" He also studied the business section in newspapers to learn about money and ""kept things simple"" when it came to spending.""I didn't change my lifestyle,"" Hill said. ""I didn't go out on a shopping spree. I didn't buy a car. I had a relationship with General Motors, and they gave me a couple of cars.""Hill, who played until age 40, was elected to the Pro Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018 and sits on the organization's board. He is also a member of the NBA Retired Players Association board of directors. In January 2021, Hill was named the new managing director of the U.S. men's national basketball team. Hill said he first became ""paranoid about money and about losing money"" after watching athletes struggle with money after their careers ended. Hill's father — former Dallas Cowboys running back Calvin Hill — played in the NFL from 1969 through 1981, so he saw some players deal with financial woes up-close.Asked if he remains anxious about similar financial outcomes, Hill said: ""There's constant paranoia. I think that's a little bit how I'm hardwired."" That thinking is reflected in his involvement in real estate investment.""I believe in hard assets, real assets,"" Hill said.Hill praised his parents for developing an interest in the sector. He recalled entering the space in 2000, during his time with the Magic. Hill invested in multifamily units and office space buildings in central Florida, a region he described as ""prime for growth, and has been growing tremendously since that time.""Through his marketing and management company Hill Ventures, the former NBA All-Star invested and developed over $200 million in projects throughout Florida in North Carolina.In his latest venture, Hill joined commercial real estate investment firm CIM Group to invest in Centennial Yards, a $5 billion mixed-use development in Atlanta. Hill said the downtown project would take seven to 10 years to complete. He compared it to L.A. Live, an entertainment and residential development outside Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Hill is one of the many athletes to profit from real estate investing post-career.Basketball Hall of Famer and fellow Pistons legend Isiah Thomas has a real estate firm within his ISIAH International company. Former National Football League running back LeSean McCoy is building his portfolio through Vice Capital.Several top-tier athletes are getting into cryptocurrency investment, but Hill is skeptical of whether the asset class is sustainable. Again, for Hill, it comes back to hard assets.""There's been great fortunes that have developed through real estate, and it's a part of allocating assets,"" he added. ""I think it's a safe bet, but I also think a profitable bet, compared to some of these sorts of new digital currencies that exist."" Hill also has sports properties in his portfolio. He's an investor in the NBA's Africa business, which is valued at $1 billion, and a minority stakeholder in the NBA's Atlanta Hawks.Hill took an equity stake and vice chair role in 2015 when he joined businessperson Tony Ressler to buy the team for more than $800 million. The Hawks are now worth $1.6 billion, according to Forbes.Hill didn't reveal his total stake in the NBA franchise. ""It's an investment, and Tony Ressler can treat me like an investor, but he treats me like a partner,"" he said. ""That's something that I truly value and appreciate.""Previously, Hill and fellow investors' $1.2 billion bid for the Los Angeles Clippers in 2014 didn't stack up to the offer from former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who paid $2 billion for the team.Another asset in Hill's portfolio: Black art.Hill began collecting the Black art pieces in the 1990s. Hill told CNBC he owns art pieces by Romare Bearden, Elizabeth Catlett, painter Norman Lewis and Hank Willis Thomas. And with more acceptance by the mainstream art community, Black art pieces have increased in value.""I think if you buy good art, and you have a good eye, and you know what you're doing, there can be a lot of money that is made,"" Hill said. Celebrity Net Worth, a website that tracks athletes and celebrates, estimates Hill made roughly $120 million from endorsements. Hill is also gaining experience in the consumer packaged goods sector as a board member of New Jersey-based Campbell Soup.Hill is also helping Philips lure first-time shavers with its Norelco OneBlade line. Terms of Hill's endorsement with Philips weren't made available. Philips is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and has a market cap of $28 billion.""You look for companies that are credible,"" Hill said of how he approaches endorsement deals with brands. ""Companies that have a history of success; ultimately embody the quality and characteristics that you stand for.""They (Philips) have a product that I think identifies and serves young college basketball fans,"" Hill added. ""I'm mindful of that because I was a young college basketball fan.""Hill played for legendary Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. The iconic coach is retiring from the program after 42 seasons and five NCAA Division I championships. Two of those title teams, 1991 and 1992, featured Hill.The retired superstar attended Krzyzewski's final home game at the school last weekend and called the moment ""bittersweet.""""To celebrate him, to celebrate his legacy — to see players from multiple decades come back, it was special,"" Hill said.And he thinks the Blue Devils are going to go all the way this year. Duke won its last NCAA championship in 2015.""We've been due,"" Hill said. ""Hopefully, we can send Coach K off with another championship."""
2022-03-12,"  Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna is the most well-known co-founder of CRISPR start-up Mammoth Biosciences, but Janice Chen, the sister of U.S. figure skating champion Nathan Chen, is also one of its four co-founders and the chief technology officer.Mammoth has added $100 million in big pharma contracts and government grants since the pandemic began, quadrupled its employee count and is still hiring, and saw its valuation rise to $1 billion in a venture deal featuring Amazon and Apple's Tim Cook.Chen has her sights set on reaching a $100 billion valuation as an independent company. Along Highway 101 north of the San Francisco Airport, a break-out biotech start-up named Mammoth Biosciences co-founded by Nathan Chen's sister Janice in 2018 is fast emerging in the revolutionary field of CRISPR technology.While not high profile like her gold medal-winning, ice skating brother — or Mammoth co-founder Jennifer Doudna, who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for her work on CRISPR — Chen's bioscience work in gene editing technology is in the forefront of medical discoveries from identifying bacterial and viral infections to early cancer detection. CRISPR, or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, effectively cuts genomes and slices DNA to treat genetic diseases.Outside of a close circle of colleagues, few knew Nathan was her sibling until she excitedly posted on social media about his gold medal victory as her family watched the televised games from her San Francisco home. Chen recalls being with her family in Seoul four years ago and watching him compete in the 2018 Winter Olympics. During breaks, she was busy contacting lawyers to start the process of setting up the company.    Since the pandemic in 2020, the biotech start-up has fast accelerated. The company nabbed approximately $100 million in contracts with Bayer and Vertex Pharmaceuticals and government grants, grew the employee count from 30 to 130, and is hiring at least 55 more. Its valuation soared to $1 billion, with $150 million in a venture deal last September that included Amazon, famed Silicon Valley VC firm Mayfield and Apple's Tim Cook.The exit strategy isn't an acquisition, as Chen sees it.""Our intention is not to build and sell it but to become a $100 billion company in next-generation CRISPR technology. There are so many creative building opportunities, and new technology that can come out of discovery in gene editing,"" said Chen. ""Identifying the business strategy has meant that I needed to step out of the lab and scale the company,"" added Chen, who worked remotely during Covid, but is now back at the company's Brisbane, California, headquarters, where its distinct green and white elephant-shaped signage is highly visible.    Growing up in Salt Lake City as one of five siblings (Nathan, 22, is the youngest), her parents, immigrants from China in 1988, encouraged ""us to reach our potential and become what is best for us,"" Chen, now 30, said. Chen learned to play the violin, competed in chess tournaments, and excelled in dance performance. In chess competitions, where she was often the youngest and the only female, she said she learned ""how to lose and how to win strategies.""She discovered her passion for bioscience while at her father's small biotech business in Utah.To relieve the stress of scaling up Mammoth Biosciences, Chen has recently taken up running in San Francisco's hills, near her home. She got up to speed for on-the-job managerial challenges by reading ""The Founder's Dilemma."" She also sought the advice of an executive coach who has helped in determining ""what kind of leader do I want to be,"" she said, adding, ""I want to help myself and others reach full potential. It's about understanding each person's motivations, what they want to try and learn, and making them part of the company ecosystem.""Mammoth Biosciences is built on core technology Chen worked on at Doudna's UC Berkeley lab. Chen earned her PhD as a graduate student researcher in this hotbed of innovation.As a mentor, Doudna encouraged Chen to set up her own business upon graduation rather than to work at a major biotech company. ""She told me I wasn't shooting high enough,"" said Chen, who has academic credentials from Harvard Medical School and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, as well as an internship at a HIV research institute in Durban, South Africa.      ""She's a leader of the technical team and an overall strategist who has deep scientific knowledge and creativity, and can see where this technology is going,"" said Doudna, whose UC Berkeley lab has been immersed in an ongoing patent battle over ownership of the biomedical technology. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recently determined in favor of the Broad Institute, a partnership of MIT and Harvard University. This decision impacts licensing for several CRISPR companies, but doesn't extend to the particular gene editing system that Mammoth Biosciences uses. Doudna is also a co-founder of publicly traded CRISPR company Intellia Therapeutics.At the age of 26, right after graduation, Chen had ventured out with fellow student and lab researcher Lucas Harrington to co-start a company. They set up shop at a biotech incubator in the up-and-coming Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. ""Janice and I split our time working in the lab and doing prototypes, and pitching venture capitalists,"" recalled Harrington. Her husband, a scientist in San Francisco that she met at Johns Hopkins, ""understands the journey"" and devotion to starting this game-changing company. ""It's my life right now,"" she said.

More on Main Street say they do with Covid relief gone They met Mayfield partner Ursheet Parikh through a connection with Doudna. Parikh was advising Stanford PhD graduate Trevor Martin on launching a diagnostics testing start-up. The venture investor brought Martin, Doudna, Harrington and Chen together, and the team formed Mammoth Biosciences. Martin is CEO, Harrington is chief scientific officer, Doudna is chair of the Scientific Advisory Board while Chen is CTO.  ""She's a multi-faceted person and clearly a genius,"" said Mayfield's Parikh, a board member and serial investor in her company.       Since 2014, CRISPR start-ups have attracted $3 billion in venture capital, according to Chris Dokomajilar, founder and CEO of biopharma database company DealForma. An analysis by GlobalData's Pharma Intelligence Center shows 74 VC deals for CRISPR technology companies since 2012, with Mammoth Biosciences in the lead of most well-funded. The start-up has raised $265 million in four financings from at least 15 VC firms and angel investors.The company's work expanded rapidly during the pandemic in 2020. Among seven firms granted $249 million for rapid tests of Covid-19 from the National Institutes of Health, the firm scaled up its patented DetectR test for commercial labs diagnosing the virus. In a collaboration with GSK Consumer Healthcare in Warren, New Jersey, a handheld device that can perform rapid diagnostic tests of the coronavirus is being created. Additionally, Mammoth Biosciences teamed up in early 2021 with Agilent Technologies in Santa Clara to develop CRISPR testing systems for labs to expand and speed up detection of the coronavirus disease.""She has a rare skill set to conceptualize the future and what this technology can do for humanity,"" said another of her investors, Harsh Patel, co-founder and managing director at Wireframe Ventures. ""She can turn incredible science in a lab into commercial technology products. It's a big leap away from the lab."" More developments came in rapid-fire sequence later in 2021 and into this year. Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston paid $41 million to the start-up to expand cell and genetic therapy tools, which could lead to $650 million in royalties. Bayer AG in Berlin paid $40 million to Mammoth Biosciences to focus on tests and cures for liver diseases, with royalties that could mount to $1 billion. Moreover, this January, the FDA granted the company emergency use authorization for a CRISPR-based molecular diagnostic testing of the coronavirus.   The accomplishments have tested Chen's strength as an innovator and business leader, but investors say she is imperturbable.  ""I've never seen her frazzled in board meetings. She has strong opinions and she backs it up not by arguing, but by data,"" said Omri Amirav-Drory, general partner at venture firm NFX, an investor and advisor. ""I'm never selling my shares, I will give it to my kids. There's a huge amount of IP in the company.""  To learn more and to sign up for CNBC's Small Business Playbook event, click here."
2022-03-12,"Warren Buffett was not done.After spending around $4.5 billion last week to buy 91.2 million shares of Occidental Petroleum, he's spent more than $1.5 billion this week to add another 27.1 million shares to Berkshire Hathaway's stake.An SEC filing late Friday revealed the purchases were made on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at prices between $51.03 and $58.58. The weighted average of the buys is around $56.60.That gives Berkshire a total of 118.3 million shares that are worth almost $6.9 billion at Friday's close of $57.95.As a result, OXY moves up a notch to 9th place on Berkshire's list of biggest reported holdings of publicly-traded U.S. shares.And it gives Berkshire nearly 12% of Occidental's outstanding shares.When its warrants to buy nearly 84 million shares, obtained as part of its 2019 deal that helped finance Occidental's purchase of Anadarko, are included, the stake that the SEC pays attention to is around 20%.The warrants have an exercise price of $59.624, which means they are a few cents away from being 'in the money.' Berkshire could then use them to buy at a price lower than the market price, generating an instant paper profit, which increases as the stock prices goes up.Occidental shares are up nearly 90% over the last 12 months as oil prices have surged.

The now-volatile stock market may not be the ideal starting point for new investors, but it's always a good time to begin investing.Millennial Americans — ranging in age from 22 to 40 — are famously wary of the financial markets. Market collapses like the dotcom bust of 2002 to 2004 and the financial crisis of 2008 will do that.""They saw huge swings in the market, and it made them more conservative,"" said certified financial planner Matthew Ricks, a millennial himself at 39 and president of Haystack Financial Planning in Syosset, New York. ""The flip side is that many of them have missed out on the biggest bull market of all time.""

The power of compounding returns over decades is enormous if you save consistently and invest in the financial markets. You can start small but get started.Here are five things for young investors to keep in mind. Investing is always a good idea … unless you have a fat balance of high-interest-rate debt sucking up cash flow.""If you have credit card debt with a crippling interest rate, pay it off before you start investing,"" said Amanda Campbell, a certified financial planner and vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in Fulton, Maryland.With an average rate of 16.15% on credit card balances last year, according to the Federal Reserve, you'll almost certainly lose more in interest costs than you'll make in the markets. ""Saving in a 7% [return] pocket while feeding a pocket that drains you at 20% or more doesn't make sense,"" she added.Lower-cost mortgage debt or even student loans needn't stop you from investing, according to Campbell. ""Just as long as you're not fighting some insane interest rate."" Every dollar should have a purpose, said Ricks. What you are saving for should determine how or if you invest the money in public markets.""If you're saving for retirement in a 401(k), it will look different than if you're saving for a down-payment on a house,"" said Ricks. ""If you want to use the money within a few years, don't put it in the stock market.""A certificate of deposit, a money market account or possibly a Treasury bond will ensure that the money is there when needed to serve its purpose. How much do you hate losing money? If the answer is a lot, you should invest accordingly. ""Be honest with yourself,"" suggested Ricks. ""If you want to follow the hot trend but can't stomach the ups and downs, know that about yourself.""Millennials are known for being conservative. ""I've reviewed a lot of accounts for millennial clients and colleagues, and they are generally not as aggressive as academics say they should be,"" said Ricks. That said, you don't have to jump into an 80% stock portfolio that might be ""appropriate"" for a 20- or 30-year-old. Start where you feel comfortable and you can make changes as you go.You may not know what your tolerance for investment risk is yet, but you'll find out when markets fall. ""It comes down to whether you can sleep at night without worrying about your investments,"" said Campbell. It's hard to argue with a 30-year-old who put all their savings into bitcoin five years ago, but a little information can be a dangerous thing when it comes to investing. Cryptocurrencies, meme stocks and hot technology companies have generated some incredible returns, but they can also produce huge losses, and a 50% decline can be demoralizing for investors just starting out.""Invest in something simple like an S&P 500 Index fund to get your feet wet,"" suggested Campbell. ""Put enough in to see how it affects you, and if you're comfortable with that, then you can consider other things like individual stocks."" If you are a believer in cryptocurrencies or like to track technology trends, pursue your interests. However, invest with your long-term savings goals in mind. In other words, do not go all in.""Treat that like Vegas money,"" said Campbell. ""Be prepared to lose it."" The objective of investing is long-term growth and getting advice on how to allocate assets and build a portfolio for long-term performance is invaluable. Young investors may not have enough assets to hire a financial advisor, but online platforms like the robo-advisors and brokers like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard have huge resources to help you build an investing plan. Take advantage of them.""You don't have to do something crazy, and you don't have to do it alone,"" said Campbell."
2022-03-14,"Former Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger is putting his name and money behind a new company that's aiming to dominate the future of the internet and the metaverse.On Monday, 3D avatar start-up Genies announced that Iger is joining its board of directors and investing an undisclosed sum in the Los Angeles-based company. Founded in 2017, Genies' mobile app allows users to create their own custom digital avatars – three-dimensional cartoon versions of themselves – for their social media profiles and, eventually, to travel the metaverse.In a press release, the 5-year-old start-up says it will count on Iger's help to grow the company, as it looks to build ""avatar ecosystems"" where users create everything from digital fashion lines for avatars to the online worlds in which those avatars can interact.Genies co-founder and CEO Akash Nigam, 29, touted Iger's involvement in a statement, saying he ""can't think of a better creative and product thinker than Bob to collaborate with.""Iger spent 15 years as Disney's CEO, starting in 2005. During that time, he oversaw the company's heavy investments in tech, paying more than $7 billion to acquire Pixar in 2007 and emphasizing the development of streaming and augmented reality technologies throughout the company. ""I've always been drawn to the intersection between technology and art, and Genies provides unique and compelling opportunities to harness the power of that combination to enable new forms of creativity, expression and communication,"" Iger said in a statement, announcing his role at Genies. Iger stepped down as Disney's CEO in 2020, succeeded by Bob Chapek. Iger also left Disney's board at the end of 2021. Just before he stepped down from Disney's board in December, Iger spoke with CNBC about how new technologies regularly disrupt the ways that media giants like Disney tell stories – perhaps more so now than when he took over Disney in 2005.""In reality, that scenario of a world in which technology's enabling more storytelling exists today probably even more so,"" Iger said.Since stepping down, the former Disney executive has hinted at his interest in the evolution of the internet – sometimes called ""internet 3.0"" or ""Web 3.0"" – and the concept of a metaverse. In January, on Kara Swisher's ""Sway"" podcast, Iger said the next iteration of the web ""will definitely be more compelling in experience, certainly more immersive, more dimensional.""He added that there won't just be one metaverse, but numerous digital worlds ready to be explored, and that users' avatars will play an important role as they hop from one metaverse to another. ""I talk about democratization. It'll be dispersed,"" he said. ""You may have an avatar, but you'll go all over the place. And I think that it's likely to be developed into something real as an experience.""That's exactly the sort of metaverse experience that a company like Genies is banking on. The start-up says its goal is to ""create a universal avatar system that can be used across an open metaverse."" Already, several companies are touting their future metaverse offerings, from Meta (formerly known as Facebook) and Microsoft to Roblox and, yes, Disney.Genies has raised a total of $100 million in funding from venture capital backers like Bond and Breyer Capital, according to Reuters. The company has also partnered with a long list of celebrities, creating online avatars for the likes of musicians Justin Bieber, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes.Genies has also teamed up with brands like Gucci on branded digital items and has launched a marketplace for digital accessory NFTs – think clothing, shoes and backpacks for those avatars.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Microsoft's metaverse plans are getting clearer with its $68.7 billion Activision acquisitionThis 29-year-old book predicted the 'metaverse' — and some of Facebook's plans are eerily similar"
2022-03-15,"ConsenSys has raised $450 million in a funding round backed by the likes of Microsoft, SoftBank and Temasek.The investment more than doubles ConsenSys' valuation to $7 billion.Tech giants from Microsoft to Twitter are becoming increasingly interested in Web3, a movement that calls for a more decentralized internet based on the blockchain. Blockchain start-up ConsenSys has raised $450 million in a new round of funding that more than doubles its valuation to $7 billion.The cash injection was led by ParaFi Capital, ConsenSys said Tuesday, with Microsoft, Japan's SoftBank and Singapore's Temasek also joining as new investors in the company.New York-headquartered ConsenSys was founded in 2014 by Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum. Ethereum is the blockchain platform behind ether, the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency.Whereas bitcoin is mostly used for transactions, Ethereum can be used to create decentralized applications, or dapps — think Facebook or TikTok, but on the blockchain, a shared record-keeping system for crypto transactions. ConsenSys develops software that runs on the Ethereum network. It marks a rare crypto-related bet from Microsoft. The company previously led an early-stage investment in Palm NFT Studio, a start-up also co-founded by Lubin.Microsoft's involvement highlights growing interest from the world's largest tech firms in Web3, a loosely-defined term that refers to efforts to create a decentralized version of the internet based on blockchain technology.It's a term that has attracted a lot of chatter — and money — in Silicon Valley. Blockchain start-ups raised a record $25 billion in venture capital funding globally last year, according to CB Insights data. Other tech giants exploring Web3 include Facebook-parent Meta and Twitter.   ConsenSys is viewed by investors as one of the companies that will power Web3. It's benefited from a flood of investment into emerging crypto trends such as decentralized finance, or DeFi, and nonfungible tokens, otherwise known as NFTs.The company's most popular products include the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet and Infura, a suite of tools that helps developers create Ethereum apps.MetaMask allows people to store and manage their tokens through a web browser extension or a mobile app. People can also access popular blockchain-powered apps like Uniswap and Axie Infinity. The bulk of ConsenSys' revenues currently comes from fees for trading different tokens on MetaMask.

The U.S., Philippines, Brazil, Germany and Nigeria are its most active markets. Infura, meanwhile, is used by over 430,000 developers and recently topped $1 trillion in annualized transaction volumes.ConsenSys said all the proceeds from its latest round would be converted into ether. The funds will go toward hiring 600 more employees, a redesign of MetaMask slated for release later this year, and building out ConsenSys' growing NFT business. Just as Web3 has generated a lot of hype, it's also drawn some notable critics, including tech billionaires Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey.Dorsey dismissed Web3 as a centralized technology owned by venture capitalists rather than the crypto community, while Musk says he thinks it's more ""buzzword"" than reality.For his part, Lubin doesn't see it that way.""What Jack may be concerned about is how a small number of VCs are grabbing the lion's share of equity or tokens in many of the best projects,"" ConsenSys' CEO said. ""I'm not concerned at all."" ""Decentralized protocol technology is anti-fragile, as is its global community,"" Lubin added. ""The community will interpret centralization as suboptimal and an opportunity, and will relentlessly decentralize."" The crypto world has also been keeping a close watch on regulatory developments out of the U.S., after President Joe Biden issued an executive order calling for a coordinated response from the government to industry oversight.Bitcoin, ether and other digital tokens initially reacted positively, only to subsequently turn south as investors grew concerned by a lack of detail in Biden's plan.The U.S. government ""has a big policy decision on its hands,"" Lubin said, adding ConsenSys ""is ready and eager to assist policymakers however we can.""""At the end of the day, permissionless blockchain networks are global, and they will grow and change our everyday lives whether or not the U.S. is a leader,"" he added."
2022-03-15,"China's digital yuan is set to challenge the dollar's domination as the currency of choice in international trade settlements, predicts author and financial technology consultant Richard Turrin.China has been ramping up efforts to roll out its central bank digital currency, and is currently far ahead in the space as compared with its global peers.Nations are likely to look for alternative payment systems as part of a ""risk management exercise"" to reduce their current dependence on the dollar, says Turrin. China's nascent digital yuan is set to challenge the dollar's domination of international trade settlements in the next decade, according to Richard Turrin, author of ""Cashless: China's Digital Currency Revolution.""""Remember, China is the largest trading country and you're going to see digital yuan slowly supplant the dollar when buying things from China,"" Turrin told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday.""If we go about five to 10 years out, yes the digital yuan can play a significant role in reducing the dollar's usage in international trade,"" said Turrin, a former banker who has also worked in fintech.The drive toward alternative payment systems is likely to come from a desire by nations to reduce their current, ""mostly 100%"" reliance on the dollar, he said.""What you're going to see in the future is a rollback, a risk management exercise that seeks to slowly and maybe just slightly reduce the dependence on dollar, from 100% down to 80%, 85%,"" he said. China has been ramping up efforts to roll out its central bank digital currency and is currently far ahead in the space compared with global peers.The People's Bank of China has been working on the digital form of its sovereign currency since 2014. Stateside, the U.S. Federal Reserve has yet to take a stand on whether to issue a digital dollar, while President Joe Biden recently called on the government to place ""urgency"" on the research and development of a potential digital version of the dollar.Turin said the world's second largest economy is currently ""ahead in all financial technology by a decade."" He added the U.S. would take ""easily another five years"" just to get out of planning and trials for a potential digital dollar.His comments came as China warily watches the U.S. and its allies' strengthened alliance following the breakout of war between Russia and Ukraine. Beijing has so far deflected blame of the conflict to the U.S. and refused to term Russia's attack an ""invasion.""

2022-03-15,"In a world where Elizabeth Holmes, Anna Delvey and the Tinder Swindler co-exist, it seems like scammers are waiting for unsuspecting victims around every corner. Sometimes, those victims are even sophisticated finance professionals.Andrew, a 27-year-old certified financial planner, learned this lesson the hard way last month when he was conned out of $3,000 by someone impersonating an investment advisor on Instagram. According to cybersecurity experts, Andrew – who asked for his last name to be withheld to protect his job security – is far from alone.More than 95,000 people lost a collective $770 million in scams or hacks initiated on social media platforms in 2021, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Such issues ""will become part of our daily life,"" Theresa Payton, CEO of Fortalice Solutions and a former White House CIO, tells CNBC Make It. ""We're going to have to put up with them, just as there used to be people trying to cash out fake checks."" Part of the reason social media scams and hacks are so frequent, Payton says, is because of who and how they target their victims online. She says several high-profile people, from Elon Musk to President Joe Biden, have been caught in similar types of schemes.""Fraudsters and cybercriminals could actually teach a masterclass in human behavior,"" she said. ""They find people who are legitimate, who have a following, who have a great background, then lure them in using social media engineering, so they can lure in other people, too.""Andrew's story, while harrowing, ends on a positive note: He was able to recover his $3,000. But it's proof that everyone's at risk these days – even financial professionals. Here's how Andrew got scammed, and the four major red flags he missed, according to Payton: It all started when Andrew saw his friend post a video on Instagram. In the video, the friend said he'd received a large return on a $3,000 cash investment in less than 24 hours, from working with an investment advisor. The friend tagged the advisor in the post, and added screenshots purporting to show how his investment had quickly ballooned to $40,000.Andrew felt suspicious, but intrigued: He and the friend shared an interest in the stock market and cryptocurrency. So he direct messaged the friend to learn more, and quickly received a personal endorsement of the strategy.""The first red flag is his friend suddenly bragging about what they're doing and how much money they're making,"" Payton says. ""If you're making money, who has time to brag about it? It's like when your friends get hacked and start posting, 'I lost this much weight in seven days.' If it's anything sounds too good to be true, even if it matches your friend's career background, it probably is.""She also recommends picking up the phone and calling that friend directly, in case someone else is controlling their account. Or, if you don't have their number, message them asking for a ""unique or special"" detail. Who is my favorite NASCAR driver? Who is your favorite college sports team?""Sometimes those questions actually make fraudsters abandon the account,"" Payton says. Still, Andrew wasn't sold. He reached out to the advisor tagged in his friend's post, inquiring about the impossibly high return on investment. The advisor ""inferred that there's some kind of derivative [crypto market] that most people aren't privy to,"" Andrew says.Quickly, the two established a rapport. The more crypto-related jargon the advisor used, the more Andrew believed he was legitimate.The speed of the advisor's response should have been another red flag, Payton says.""If somebody is frequently responding to your DMs, it's less likely that it's really a person responding,"" she says. ""It's more likely that it's from a script with canned responses."" Andrew, following instructions, put $1,000 in a Zelle account and another roughly $2,000 in bitcoin in Cash App. He gave the accounts' information to the advisor, who sent Andrew a link to a site that appeared to be Forex, an online foreign exchange market. Within five minutes, Andrew watched his $3,000 investment jump to more than $42,000.Starting to feel uneasy, Andrew said he was ready to cash out. The advisor, who now controlled the accounts, agreed to release the funds — but only if Andrew recorded a video of himself endorsing the process.Andrew says he initially resisted, because ""it's against the CFP code of conduct to provide unsolicited financial advice while promising returns."" But the advisor assured him the video would only be viewed by potential clients, and never published externally.Payton says this is the third red flag: Andrew should have recognized the tactic from his own personal experience, ""because that's how [Andrew] got hooked – a video posted by his friend."" Andrew recorded a video with disclaimers, saying he wasn't endorsing the advisor's services, and sent it to the advisor. The advisor then sent Andrew a link to extract his profits, but instead of leading to Forex, the link opened what appeared to be Instagram's login page. Andrew entered his username and password, and was almost immediately locked out of his account.At this point, Andrew says, he realized he had been conned. He called the police to file an incident report, opened up his side hustle's Instagram account and started broadcasting warnings about his personal Instagram account and the account of the so-called advisor.Weeks later, he still doesn't have access to his personal Instagram account — which, until recently, was reposting edited videos appearing to show Andrew endorsing the scammer. When contacted by CNBC Make It, a spokesperson from Facebook, Instagram's sister brand, said they'd investigate further.""We have sophisticated measures in place to stop bad actors in their tracks before they gain access to accounts, as well as measures to help people recover their accounts,"" the spokesperson said. ""We know we can do more here, and we're working hard in both of these areas to stop bad actors before they cause harm, and to keep our community safe.""As for the money, Andrew called his bank — which immediately halted the $1,000 Zelle transaction, and directed him to file a separate claim through Visa and Cash App to recover the other $2,000. Ultimately, Andrew got the money back. But by this point, his credibility as a financial expert was at risk.Together, he says, he and his boss alerted the CFP Board of Standards, which monitors the competency and ethical practices of all CFPs across several countries. Unsure of how his Instagram username and personal information could be linked to his company, he also asked his employer's IT department to monitor any suspicious activity.Today, Andrew's career as a CFP remains intact. And as far as he knows, the scammer was unable to get into any of his other social media accounts or — more crucially — bank accounts.Payton says that after the scam occurred, Andrew ""did all the right things"" to protect his personal information. For others hoping to avoid similar predicaments, here's her advice:Consider using different email accounts for your social media, financial and health care accounts. Use an encrypted service like ProtonMail for any account linked to highly sensitive or confidential information.Turn on multi-factor authentication for all of your accounts. If you get a notification of unusual activity on your account, don't click on any links. Instead, go directly to your profile and change your password manually.Authorize a friend or family member to have emergency access to your account. Some social media platforms allow you to assign a backup user on their ""privacy and settings"" page. Instagram doesn't yet, but the Facebook spokesperson told CNBC Make It that the feature is currently being tested.Report the account to the social media platform, file a police report and submit claims to FBI at IC3.gov and the Federal Trade Commission at ftc.gov.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:This SIM card scam once fooled Jack Dorsey—here’s how to avoid itThese are the 20 most common passwords leaked on the dark web — make sure none of them are yours"
2022-03-16,"For Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, investing can be a real headache.""As a rule, I don't invest [often], because then you've got to be watching it every day, and I like my head to be really peaceful and low stress,"" Wozniak tells CNBC Make It. That's why he says he tries to avoid buying stocks or other volatile assets ⁠– because, as he told Fortune in 2018, a daily obsession with their worth ""could corrupt your values.""Still, he'll put money behind a venture he believes in: Wozniak is currently an investor on the online reality show ""Unicorn Hunters."" The show sees Wozniak and other stars – including former U.S. Treasurer Rosie Rios and singer Lance Bass, among others – field investment pitches from tech start-up founders.Wozniak's goal isn't to ""make a ton of money,"" he says. Rather, it's to support companies and ideas that personally interest him. The mindset isn't new: It's one reason why Wozniak is now, reportedly, a millionaire – as opposed to a billionaire, like the late Steve Jobs was before his death in 2011.But Wozniak wouldn't have it any other way. Here's how he weighs a company or asset before he decides to do one of his least favorite things: invest. Wozniak's aversion to investing doesn't stop tech companies from pitching him constantly, he says.""For ages and ages, I get pitched a dozen times a day to join other companies and startups [that say], 'We're going to be the next Apple, we're gonna be the next Steve Jobs, whatever,'"" he says. ""I just get so tired of telling them all, I am backlogged and I don't really have the time."" A start-up has to tickle one of his personal interests or play into his computer engineering experience – at a minimum – if its founders want to reel him in as a backer. Wozniak says his decades of experience take over when he judges whether a company has a chance to succeed.""I'm just looking at: Does this technology mathematically, scientifically, [and] engineering-wise have a chance of actually being developed at a reasonable cost?"" he says. It always helps to be skeptical as an investor, Wozniak says. Most sales pitches only highlight the best possible outcomes for a product or company.""I try to be a little skeptical and get into the mathematics of it a bit,"" he says. ""I also try to think about: Does this technology already exist? Does it have worthwhile alternatives? Is it really saving people as much as it claims to be? Every story you ever hear, every pitch, is always extremely good for the world, [so] I try to give it some analysis.""That tech skepticism also extends to any company's business side. Wozniak says he considers himself to be fairly financially conservative, and the last thing he wants to do is invest in a company that's overextending itself.""I always believe you should do everything that you can afford, and don't do everything on credit,"" he says. ""So I look for that in a company: Are they going to be successful? Their money that's coming in, is it real? Is it going to be scalable, and continue through time?"" Wozniak says he's ""very skeptical"" of most cryptocurrencies, and that investing in crypto is often ""too risky"" for the average person – especially if they're biting off more than they can chew.The Apple co-founder says he sees ""an awful lot of opportunity for [scammers]"" using crypto hype, and the digital currency's complicated and volatile nature, to take advantage of uninformed investors. ""I only look for cryptocurrencies that are based upon – kind of like stock in a company – something you could visualize and see, and they've been successful already,"" he says.In that vein, Wozniak is currently involved with two cryptocurrency projects. One is from Efforce, a blockchain project that funds energy-efficient companies, which Wozniak helped launch in 2020. Efforce offers a crypto token called WOZX that Wozniak says allows investors to earn a portion of the profits that come from those companies' energy savings.On the plus side, Wozniak says, ""it's based upon real results and real return on investment."" On the minus side, he notes, Efforce is ""having problems getting [WOZX] implemented."" The cryptocurrency's price has dropped more than 90% over the past year, according to Coinbase.Wozniak also touts a cryptocurrency called Unicoin, recently created for ""Unicorn Hunters."" The token helps fund start-ups who pitch investors on the show, and pays dividends based on those companies' success. In other words, it's a chance to invest in start-ups alongside Wozniak.Wozniak says he's ""played with"" many other cryptocurrencies. He's the least skeptical about bitcoin and Ethereum's ether, he says: ""Bitcoin is just gold. I mean, nobody owns it. It's mathematics.""Still, he says, he quickly sold most of those crypto holdings. ""I just kept one bitcoin, because I'm scared,"" he says. ""I don't want to be tracking it up and down, up and down, like stocks every day. That's just not my life… I have a lot of desire for things that are stable and predictable.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Steve Wozniak: Steve Jobs wasn't a natural-born leader, he worked to 'develop his communication' skillsSteve Wozniak is starting another company, 45 years after co-founding Apple with Steve Jobs"

DoubleLine Capital's Jeffrey Gundlach is with us live to react to what the Fed just said and what the Fed just did. Jeffrey, welcome back. It's great to have you on the new program.JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Nice to be on your new show, Scott. Congratulations.WAPNER: Thanks so much. So, you heard the Fed, they've spoken. It's your turn. What do you think?GUNDLACH: Well, the Fed follows the 2-year treasury and I've been saying this for years and years. I don't know if your viewers can see this chart here. But it's a chart of the Fed funds rate in red and a 2-year Treasury in blue. So, look what the 2-year Treasury in blue did starting fourth quarter of last year. It went up by guess what? 175 basis points. So, what did the Fed do today? They said they're gonna raise Fed funds by 175 basis points. And so that's just them following again, and they're way behind. I was listening to this prior segment. You know, here's one more chart I'm going to give you. The blue line is wage growth, wages and salaries and employment cost index. The red line is Fed funds. The blue line is the wage growth. If you look carefully at that chart, the Fed follows wage growth historically, that chart goes back to 1985. This time, wage growth has exploded higher, and the Fed has been behind the curve and I, I thought that Jay Powell did an okay job today. He was a little bit of an equivocator. I thought it was better than the last time we were in sort of a predicament which was in the fourth quarter of 2018 when the Fed was raising rates and doing quantitative tightening. I think the stock market was way oversold. I think commodities got way overbought. And so, I'm not surprised that we've had relative market stability into this Fed decision and I expect that the oversold will continue to work its way higher, in other words, stocks will go higher. I saw your question about what will be higher on the S&P at the next meeting, I think probably we will be within that time period.WAPNER: What will be higher?GUNDLACH: I think it will be happening higher because we're oversold and we didn't get the 50 which the market was fearing I think although I thought the probability that was awfully low, and we didn't get any clarity on reducing the balance sheet. And I think that the market kind of likes the fact that the party is going on. They sort of like the fact that the Fed is behind the curve for now, even though it means that they may have to accelerate and get in front of the curve for now, rates are still really accommodative. And the Fed didn't do the 50 and there's, they're not shrinking the balance sheet yet. I think the market will roll over once the Fed raises rates a couple more times and if they start the roll off, which he sort of alluded to being the base case that the next meeting, I think that's when you've got the double whammy. At least he didn't pull the 20 to 18 thing of autopilot. He tried to have some flexibility. He gave the impression of autopilot. But he didn't say it and I think he even said the word flexible or nimble or something like that and the market likes that over the, over the oversold.WAPNER: So the median Fed official now sees seven hikes this year right? So six more for the remainder of the year. Does that sound right to you? Is it too aggressive? Not, not aggressive enough? Too late? We know it's too late but how do you see where the Fed sees things today in terms of the number of rate hikes that we now expect. When we visited about a month ago at the Super Bowl, you said probably five or so was the number. This appears to be more aggressive and make no mistake, this was a hawkish Fed today.GUNDLACH: It was definitely on the hawkish side. You try to thread the needle, but it was too hard to do. So, it was a little bit hawkish. I'm just gonna say one more time, judge. The Fed follows the two-year Treasury. The 2-year Treasury went up 175 basis points, now they're talking seven hikes. The 2-year Treasury has gone a lot higher in yield since we met on February 11th and so it's totally appropriate for the Fed to be adjusting that higher. But the one thing I heard a lot of discussion about financials and it relates to where we are in the cycle, I think Josh Brown really nailed it, and that is we're starting this Fed hike cycle with a very flat yield curve. Typically, when people say financials are good for the first three or four rate hikes, that's because the curve starts out steeper than where we are right now. The curve 2s to 10s is basically puts you on recession watch when it's inside of 50 basis points, and it gets you on a really big recession watch when you get down to flat. We're right exactly in the middle at 25 basis points and that is an incredibly flat yield curve given where we are in terms of the absolute rate level versus the inflation rate and the whole thing. Also investors should look at 5s, 30s. the yield spread between the 5-year Treasury and 30-year Treasury. Same deal. You're on recession watch when you're inside of 50 and when it inverts, you're pretty much on your way to recession. Well, same thing as 2s and 10s. We're right there in the middle. But the big message of the market today is that people haven't really talked about is it the 30-year Treasury bond rallied. The 30-year Treasury bond one year ago was basically at exactly the same level as it is today. The attitude about Fed policy has changed so mightily in the last year and if the 30-year Treasury rate is unchanged, interest rates in Europe have gone up on 10-year treasuries by a fair amount from a year ago. They've also gone up in Japan but not in the United States. All we've done is flatten the curve and that puts us later in the cycle I think because as people have said correctly, the bond market has done the tightening. They're following the 2-year and the flatness of the yield curve at these rate levels is something that is going to be problematic, but again, the market is working off an oversold. When the VIX gets towards 40, I've just gotten to the point in my career I've seen this movie so many times, when the VIX gets above 35, I don't care how bad the tape looks, I don't care how bad the geopolitics look, you're supposed to get more bullish, not more bearish and you got an oversold bounce. And the market was very oversold, particularly the NASDAQ, and commodities were very overbought. One thing on inflation which has surprised everybody to the upside just about and it's going to remain sticky, but you are going to get some relaxation on inflation. You go to have these base effects, it's a, it's a true narrative that you have a huge month over month increases that are coming in several months from now and it's likely that we're going to see the over year inflation rate go down somewhat. So that might give the Fed a little bit of a tailwind and not have to work so hard. But Jay Powell said powerful tools, using our tools, we're going to use our tools, we're going to bring the inflation rate down so you're right to coin that, to frame that as a hawkish meeting.WAPNER: Yeah. 10% inflation is what you recently said you thought the projection would be. Are you sticking with that today? Was that a little bit hyperbolic?GUNDLACH: It was a little hyperbolic. I actually said I think nine, and maybe 10. I don't, I'm not even sure we're gonna get a nine now because the commodity prices have come down a fair amount. That was really, that was at the moment that oil was at about $125 a barrel and the decline from there has been sufficient that it looks like we're going to get eight handle inflation. We might even get it, you know, in the next print and it might stay there for a couple of months. But I don't think we're going to have the same inflation rate the full year 2022. I think it's going to be lower for the full year than it was in 2021 but not what the Fed is forecasting. We're not going to get low fours. We're not going to get mid fours. I think we're going to be talking about again, it's going to have a lot to do with commodity complex, but I think we'll be talking about something around high fives inflation for 2022 which is still not close to the Fed's stated topic target all the way down to 2%. So one thing I want to talk about is there's a way to project what the yield curve will look like in a year using well the one-year forward curve of the Treasury market's pretty wonky. But it predicts one year from now that the 2-year Treasury will be at 250 and every other rate along the yield curve will be at 250. Now I respect the bond market message of course, but I think that's too high. I think actually the yield curve will be flat, but it won't even be as high as 250. So we've already seen I think the peak potentially in the 30-year treasury bond because it just doesn't go up in yield in spite of all of the changes we've seen macroeconomically and with the Fed. We're just getting a flatter and flatter curve. So, the strange thing is that this year, year to date, we've had highly correlated S&P 500 stocks and Treasury market and the broad bond market broadly unfortunately is correlated on the downside. So stocks down, you know, 10%, 12% through yesterday, some down much more than that. Bond funds, even some of them call themselves core bond funds, there are some that are down 9%, 10% total return year to date, not mine, thankfully. But you know, just the bond market index is down, you know, 5%. So the 60/40 mix that people traditionally have, and I think they've probably wandered from that in recent years, but that 60/40 mix is a pretty lousy return for the first quarter. It might get a little bit better in the final two weeks. But I think what Josh Brown said again, I thought he made some good points. I think he said that when people get their statement, they're not going to be happy. And that that could, that could lead to the next you know, some, some volatility as we enter the month of April.WAPNER: Let me ask you this, do you, do you think we're going to have a recession? And are you more or less confident today that the Fed can actually pull this off in part because of what you said about inflation actually coming down a bit, not to target clearly, but certainly not going the opposite direction any, any steeper?GUNDLACH: It's a really bad bet to count on the Fed engineering a soft landing in this kind of environment with the curve partially inverted, but let's just call it quite flat at this low yield level. I just don't see it and again, I can't reiterate enough. This balance sheet tapering or shrinkage is going to be correlated with a significant headwind for the S&P 500. I talked about this for years that there's a tremendous correlation between the size of the Fed's balance sheet which is now just under $9 trillion and the market capitalization of the S&P 500. And we talked about how that was going to be supportive back last summer that's going to be supportive into year end. But now we're going the other way. We've got the Fed raising interest rates and the great Marty Zweig used to say, ""Rule number one, don't fight the Fed. Rule number two, see rule number one.""  And the Fed is raising rates sequentially as a base case and they're going to be tapering, and that means multiple contraction is going to continue and this is going to be, I don't think we're going to go back to the highs of the year in the stock market. I think we're going to be higher in May, but I think we've seen the high of the year with this with the Fed and the yield curve and the consumer sentiment being pretty soft. Although I will say something on the consumer sentiment, I noticed somebody commented that it was in a freefall and that's true, from the University of Michigan, but it's really because of autos and housing, and autos are up so much that people realize that it's a very uneconomic time to buy a vehicle and housing is up 30% on the national median, over the last two years. It's just possible that the sentiment will get a little bit better if the inflation numbers start to peak out and if we can just get that inflation rate below six, it's possible that the recession gets forestalled. I don't, I don't have a base case of a recession this year. But I do think that we'll probably get one in 2023.PART IIWAPNER: Welcome back to ""Overtime."" More of my exclusive conversation with DoubleLine CEO, Jeffrey Gundlach. We've had a lot of big hitters on the network this week Jeffrey, Scott Minerd among them who said, and we've talked a lot today about the 2-year and you mentioned that 30-year but the 10-year he thought maybe the yield was topping out in his words. Two to two and a quarter was the range he saw. You agree with that?GUNDLACH: I think the long end as I referenced in the first segment, I think the long end saw its peak last year. I mean, the long bond was, was up substantially higher than that, at its peak where it is right now. And so I think, broadly, that the long end of the curve is reasonably safe place to be which is a very strange thing for me to say because the valuation of it is so terrible relative to inflation. We have a long bond, you know, below two and a half percent, you got the inflation rate pushing 8%, but basically, it's just because of the economic situation and the uncertainty and the relative comparison to other bonds in the world even though that comparison has gotten less favorable for the United States. But I do think I do think that investors and we we've been talking about this in our, our get togethers Scott for the past few times that as weird as it sounds, I think investors should own long term treasuries as part of their portfolio. I own some long-term treasuries as part of my core strategies and even my flagship fund which is we own the long ones because they will do well during a turnover in the economy and certainly, if the inflation rate is, is rated lower as we move forward in the year, so I think those are okay. In fact, I think bonds broadly are sort of okay in spite of their bad valuation. In fact, one area that I've, have not been very enthusiastic about for quite some time is the corporate bond market. The investment rate corporate bond market, the yields have quietly been going up and going up faster than treasury yields, which means their relative spreads are getting wider. And the balance sheets of corporate America are in great shape. The other thing that now has turned into a potential positive with, with corporate bonds and longer-term treasuries is that duration, interest rate risk isn't, isn't a problem at the present time. So corporate balance sheets are in good shape. Corporate bonds have a very, they have a lot of interest rate risk which hasn't been good, but now it's not been that painful. They have a duration, the LQD ETF at times has a duration of 10 which means it has more interest rate risks than even the 10-year Treasury, but they've gotten cheaper and credit product broadly has gotten cheaper even as yields have gone up. So until such time as there's closer to a recession, in view, I think it's a reasonable time to be moving into some of these areas that have been widening kind of stealthily in the last several months.WAPNER: And this is very interesting.GUNDLACH: Yes, go ahead.WAPNER: I'm sorry, finish finish your thought, my bad. I didn't mean to step on your toes.GUNDLACH: That's all, that's fine. I'm just saying that we've been, we've been actually buying some corporate debt and we had liked a bank loans in the junk bond market relative to regular high yield but our answer on that has really neutralized, and now we're sort of favoring regular high yield more. I think that the investment business is always anticipatory. So, everybody knew that the Fed was going to go on a sequential rate hike thing and so the fact that that was going to happen got priced in the bank loan market. So BKLN, the bank loan ETF held up until very recently far better than JNK, which is the ETF for junk bonds or so called high yield bonds. I call them junk bonds because the yield's not high but I think what's been happening in recent weeks is people are starting to realize that the Fed is priced into the market, the 2-year Treasury has priced in all these rate hikes and the bond market is saying that we're not going to get that much more of a yield increase on the 2-year Treasury. It'll go higher, of course, but I think the 2-year Treasury even could be getting close to its peak for this cycle. The bond market says it's going to peak out around 250. As I said, in the prior segment, I don't even think it's going to get that high. So at 2%, which we kissed today on two-year, what's wrong with a two-year Treasury. I mean it's very low risk, it matures in two years. It's probably good, it's probably a good time to have dry powder sometime in the next two years if you're going into recession, but just shorter duration product in general that has very little interest rate risk, and I've been talking in the past with you Scott of having cash and these days, I think you're better off in the two-year Treasury than you are in cash because it's going to take, take time for cash to get your yield up to that 2% level where the two-year is so a barbell in the bond market is sort of interesting, where you own sort of the short end and the long end because there's really no yield difference. You own that for totally different reasons but both of them have a, have a spot in a portfolio.WAPNER: I love the fact that you're giving our viewers in ""Overtime"" some real actionable advice. But I have to say in listening to you talk for the past several minutes, I don't know what was in your breakfast this morning, you're more positive on a lot of things than I expected you frankly to be. You think stocks can go up until May. You're suggesting that bonds can be a good investment, so bonds and stocks can go up at the same time. You talk fairly favorably about high yield in certain opportunities and you even think inflation is going to come down even albeit slightly that's a much more positive if you want to call it that picture then frankly, Jeffrey, I expected from you.GUNDLACH: Well judge, I'm old school. When you mark down the NASDAQ 20%, I like it better. I don't like buying stuff what's at an all-time high in a massively stretched valuation. I didn't like junk bonds at all, you know, several months ago. I didn't like corporate bonds because their spreads were too tight but when the market reprices, you've got to, you've got to reallocate your thinking in your portfolio so on a really big picture thing, I want to show the viewers two more charts. So what I've been talking about European stocks versus US and here's the chart, when the blue line is going up, that's the S&P 500 outperforming Europe. And when the blue line stops going up, which happened back in 2020 almost two years ago, Europe has performed in line even, even lately, which is sort of shocking given how much exposure Europe has to this to this war that's going on between Ukraine and Russia. And yet, yeah, they underperformed briefly when the invasion started, but they basically snapped back and have been in line with US stocks. So I kind of still think that you have a reason to be longer term and one last slide which is the NASDAQ versus the S&P 500. When the blue line is going up, the NASDAQ is outperforming. This was the .com thing. This is now and we've we've rolled over so I think that the NASDAQ is not the place to be. For the short term, yes because it's oversold. But if you're truly an investor, I'm not talking about between now and May here. I'm talking about looking forward to 2023 and beyond, I think you want to, want to avoid these greatly overvalued momentum stocks. And I also think that investors should potentially think about investing in emerging market equity gradualistically as volatile as all get out. But I think, I think ultimately it's going to be a strong performer for a multiyear horizon and it's cheap.WAPNER: So you said at the Super Bowl when I talked to you about emerging markets that I think you said it almost exactly you hadn't start buying it. You didn't start buying it yet. It's okay to start, you know, averaging into it. Have you started doing that yourself in emerging markets?GUNDLACH: No, I have not. I've not bought emerging market equity. I really, one of the reasons is that for the emerging market trades to really work, you need the dollar to go down and the dollar is, is on a flight to quality bid and it's also bid up because the yield curve flattening is the, one of the best short-term indicators of the direction of the dollar. So, the yield curve flattening leads to a higher dollar and the yield curve steepening tends to lead to a weaker dollar. So, with the yield curve flattening, the dollar has maintained a bid and with the geopolitics. So the trade I'm talking about with emerging markets is one you want to invest for your grandchildren's college education. It's one where you want to buy it systematically. I'm not in any hurry to start doing it but I don't think it's foolish to start doing it. I'm just being more, you know, I watch this stuff like a hawk day in and day out. For somebody that has a real, somebody that has a real job, they might want to put in something systematic. You can't watch it tick by tick. But I will observe that emerging markets have also stopped underperforming in spite of all of this upheaval. Also emerging market debt, ex Russia, has widened out a fair amount stealthily as well. It's about 450 basis points over, over treasuries, and that's why by, by a fair amount, so emerging market debt is something we've been cautious on and thankfully, for various reasons, we were extraordinarily underweight in Ukraine, Russia and the like. So we've managed to sidestep that banana peel, but I do think that a lot of these things that have widened out, I'm expecting some, some stability. As a trader, you want to be increasing risk. As an investor, I mean, investor I mean, two plus year horizon, you actually want to use this this period of strength to reduce risk.WAPNER: Okay, let me ask you finally before I let you run, Bitcoin or gold in this new environment that we're now in. We at least have a little more certainty on where the Fed path looks to be. What would I rather own today if I'm watching this program, Bitcoin or gold or a crypto you can take crypto in general or gold?GUNDLACH: Well, I use Bitcoin. You know, Bitcoin has fallen into a range with the high end being 60,000 and the low end being 40,000. It seems like every time we get together, it's either at 60 or at 40. Last time, it was at 40 so it hasn't moved since then—WAPNER: That's true.GUNDLACH: Time before that, it was at 60. So with the range of 40 to 60 and gold being in a range that sort of, I don't know, let's call it 1750 to 2000, gold is sort of in the middle of its range. Bitcoin is at the low end of its range. So I would take or now through, through the next Fed meeting, I will take Bitcoin over gold.WAPNER: Ah, interesting. Look I appreciate—GUNDLACH: Look, you can't believe all this positive stuff I'm saying.WAPNER: Exactly.GUNDLACH: But it's for the short-term. Again, my long-term view is still that we're in a debt disaster situation and the only way out is to monetize or to default. That's always going to be the case. The mathematics just doesn't work of paying off $168 trillion of unfunded liabilities with a $24 trillion nominal GDP. That's still coming and it's coming in the next recession unfortunately. That's when the dollar goes down so that's what I'm telling investors—WAPNER: You gave us and our viewers a lot. That's for certain. Put the next Fed meeting down on your calendar, we want to have you back in ""Overtime"" to digest and discuss that one too. Jeffrey Gundlach, I appreciate your time today. Thanks so much.GUNDLACH: Alright, thanks judge. Good luck everybody."

The wealthiest Americans got richer, too, as they were able to afford to make higher-risk investments that turned into strong returns. The roaring stock market and crypto gains created more than a million new millionaires in the U.S. last year, according to a new report.The number of Americans with $1 million or more in investible assets surged to a record 14.6 million in 2021, up from 13.3 million in 2020, according to a report from wealth research firm the Spectrem Group.The growth rate of over 10% was the strongest in years, boosted by trillions of dollars in wealth created by the stock market, crypto and other assets.""It was the strongest year ever for millionaire creation in all segments,"" said George Walper, president of Spectrem Group.The wealth surge was strongest at the top. The number of Americans worth $25 million or more surged by 18%. There are now a record 252,000 Americans worth $25 million or more, up from 214,000 in 2020. By contrast, the number of so-called ""mass affluent"" investors — or those with between $100,000 and $1 million — grew by about 2%.The stock market was by far the largest engine of wealth creation for millionaires and the wealthy in 2021. The S&P 500 gained 27% last year, while the Nasdaq was up 21%. The wealthiest 1% of Americans gained over $3 trillion in stock-market wealth in 2021, according to Federal Reserve data.Crypto and other assets — such as NFTs, collectibles and real estate — also gained in value, adding to the wealth of the wealthy. The total market cap of crypto assets, despite wild swings in prices, gained $1.5 trillion last year to over $2.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko.Values of private-equity and venture-capital investments also surged. Since the wealthy can afford to put more of their money in investments, especially those with the highest risks and rewards, ultra-millionaires benefitted more than the mass affluent in 2021.""The wealthy have the greatest exposure to the broadest investments,"" Walper said. ""It wasn't just traditional liquid markets that did well last year. It was also alternative investments, real-estate investments and crypto.""The wealth gains at the top also widened the wealth gap in the U.S. The share of wealth held by the top 1% grew to a record 32% last year, according to the Fed.Wealth experts say it's unlikely that last year's gains will be sustained in 2022, given soaring inflation, rising interest rates and a potential economic slowdown. Stock market declines have already started trimming the paper fortunes of investors. The Nasdaq is down 14.5% for the year, while the S&P is down 8.4%.""Every day changes, so it's hard to predict where the year will wind up,"" Walper said. ""But the first few months of 2022 have already painted a different picture than 2021."""

Ukraine has passed a law that creates a legal framework for the cryptocurrency industry in the country.The bill, which was adopted by Ukraine's parliament last month and signed into law by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, will allow foreign and Ukrainian cryptocurrencies exchanges to operate legally, according to the country's Ministry of Digital Transformation.Banks will be allowed to open accounts for crypto companies.The ""virtual assets"" law determines the legal status, classification and ownership of virtual assets. It also introduces financial monitoring measures for virtual assets.Ukraine's National Securities and Stock Market Commission will regulate the market. The body will be in charge of areas including issuing licenses to crypto businesses and implementing state policy in the industry.Zelenskyy has signed the law as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, underscoring the role that cryptocurrencies have taken on during the conflict. Last month, Ukraine began accepting donations toward its military defense against Russia via digital currencies like bitcoin and ether. It has since expanded the number of cryptocurrencies that it accepts for donations and has raised over $63 million so far, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.Earlier this week, Ukraine's government launched an official website where people around the world can donate via cryptocurrencies. The money will go towards Ukraine's military and humanitarian efforts. Ukraine's cryptocurrency law comes as countries around the world assess how to regulate the industry, often in diverging ways.El Salvador for example has made bitcoin a legal currency and sought to make the country a hub for crypto activity. China, on the other hand, has looked to wipe out trading and cryptocurrency mining.This month, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling on federal agencies to take a unified approach to regulation and oversight of digital assets. The executive order is not a piece of legislation to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.In several countries where there is not a specific cryptocurrency regulation like Ukraine, governments have sought to bring exchanges and other digital assets companies under the purview of financial regulators. For example, in the U.K., cryptocurrency exchanges must register with the Financial Conduct Authority and are subject to existing rules around money laundering.In comparison, Ukraine's approach seeks to build a law specifically tailored to the digital asset industry."

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Emirati property magnate Hussain Sajwani is riding high after a record start to the year for Dubai's property market. ""Dubai is doing very well,"" the veteran real estate developer told CNBC on Wednesday. ""The way Dubai handled Covid was a key factor in booming the market now.""Dubai saw $35 billion worth of property market transactions in 2021, the highest recorded since the global financial crisis, according to real estate firm Savills. A separate report from CBRE said total transaction volumes are now tracking at the highest level ever recorded for the first two months of this year. Sajwani said the United Arab Emirates, which has long been a popular destination for Russian wealth and tourism, would stand to benefit as Russians seek refuge in the UAE and a safe haven for their fortunes amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and unprecedented Western sanctions.""I'm sure a lot of Russians are trying to fix their problems and their issues, but Dubai will benefit ultimately from any crisis,"" he said. It comes after the UAE, which has deepening ties with Russia, decided not to match sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. ""I'll be honest with you, these sanctions… they made a lot of people nervous,"" Sajwani said. ""If anyone brings money through the banking system here legally and professionally, we'll do business with them."" Russians were among the top purchasers of real estate before the war and sanctions, according to a recent Reuters report, which also said Russians were buying property in Dubai and even using crypto as a way of getting their money into the Gulf state. The country's property market has also allegedly been a common channel for money laundering, experts have said, where individuals avoiding sanctions or seeking to park illicitly obtained wealth have been able to funnel their cash.The UAE was put on a financial crime watchdog's ""gray list"" earlier this month over concerns that the Gulf country isn't sufficiently stemming illegal financial activities. Concerns over money laundering and illicit financial flows spurred the Financial Action Task Force, which was set up by the Group of 7 economies, put the UAE on a monitoring list alongside Turkey, Jordan, Pakistan and others.In response to the designation, the UAE said it takes its role in protecting financial integrity ""extremely seriously and will work closely with the FATF to quickly remedy the areas of improvement identified."" Sajwani said progress on the Iran nuclear deal would also be a tailwind. ""If the Iranian-American peace treaty, nuclear treaty, happens and takes place, it will be a big benefit for Dubai,"" he said. ""It will see much more stability and peace in the region,"" he added.Dubai's property market reversed multiple years of price declines last year as the city shunned lockdowns, ramped up vaccinations and enacted new policies to draw in tourists and residents while the pandemic shut down the rest of the world. The long-awaited Dubai Expo 2020, delayed for a year due to the pandemic, also helped pull in interest as the multi-billion dollar project aims to become a new residential and commercial complex after the event ends in April. Whether Expo will become the new thriving city within a city its developers have planned, however, is still yet to be seen.""Dubai's residential market has been the poster child of the rebound in real estate demand in 2021,"" Savills said. ""The city's residential market not just outperformed its past activity levels but was among the best-performing markets globally."" "

Following is a link to video on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/03/18/were-starting-to-take-massive-moves-in-assets-for-granted-says-jim-chanos.html.All references must be sourced to CNBC.PART ISCOTT WAPNER: Now to the investor known for his prowess betting against companies. Jim Chanos the president and founder of Kynikos Associates. He joins me now live. Welcome, Jim to ""Overtime."" It's so good to have you.JIM CHANOS: Thanks, Scott and congrats on the new show.WAPNER: Thank you so much. It's, as I just said to Jim Cramer, Jim Chanos, what a week. It's been from where we were on Monday to where we are now there is it feels like some newfound momentum in the market. Who knows if it lasts, obviously, but what do you make of where we are. Is now the time to cover shorts or to double down because of the kind of move that we've had? What do you think?CHANOS: Well, while he was on, I was looking up the symbol for Joe Blow. It's not one I know. But I think that what we've seen this week is a relief rally. You, you mentioned the bubble stocks, earlier the bubble stocks were leading the way this week. I have shorts that were up 30% and 40% since Tuesday morning, and we've seen the snapback in the Chinese market. And what's really interesting about what happened prior to Tuesday and from Tuesday to today is we are starting to take for granted really massive moves in asset classes and entire markets. I pointed out to people a few days ago that the Chinese market prior to Tuesday was down basically by a third in a straight line over three weeks. And whether it was the US tech listed stocks or the kind of the Chinese SOEs listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong. And to put that in perspective, that was $4 trillion worth of market decline or 5% of global GDP, Scott. 5% of global GDP was exactly what all of the global markets lost in October of 1987 and I'm dating myself here, but but basically caused the world to have a heart attack. And in this case, we just sort of shrugged and said oh Chinese stocks are volatile. And then of course they bounce back. And so whether you see PayPal or or Netflix down $100 billion on news, Alibaba up $100 billion on government, government reassurances, these are becoming commonplace. And I think it's just good to step back and realize a little bit about how uncommon these kinds of moves historically are.WAPNER: Have you covered any of your shorts based on the kind of activity that you've witnessed?CHANOS: No, we haven't really covered a lot but because we have a lot of our positions in the form of put or put spreads, we actually get less invested as as the market goes up in our short only accounts and we've been about market neutral all week in our in our hedge fund.WAPNER: I mean, you have had obviously a long history with China since you mentioned it you've been a bear since '09. I mean, one of certainly the longest bears on Wall Street and there was a history as well with a one-time short, for example of Alibaba which you covered a long time ago, and I was curious as to how you viewed the not only the position of some of those stocks and how dramatically they fell because of the new regulations there, COVID which is by all accounts out of control, and I wanted to ask you what positions you have on now from a short side as it relates to Chinese tech stocks, internet stocks, or any Chinese stocks.CHANOS: So we, we have a couple of Chinese financials that are listed in Hong Kong that have been long term core positions for us that are, we're still on and of course we still have our position in Wynn, which has exposure to Wynn Macau, but the only the only tech stock of note and I think it was up, I think it was up about 70% from the lows this week, is the Chinese internet broker, Futu. And which is had quite a quite a run this year from from the highs earlier in 2021 of near $100 down to 20 and back up to 40. And it's a simple story, trading stocks in the People's Republic of China on Western exchanges, it is illegal and Futu is in the business of basically getting a Chinese citizens among other citizens to to trade stocks through Hong Kong or Singapore in Western markets, which is technically against the law in China. So it's kind of a unique situation.WAPNER: I mention. Yeah, I mentioned in a little bit you're gonna reveal a new short position in a very well-known name. I don't want you to do that yet. I want to continue the conversation about China I mean, in the universe of all of these stocks and you saw the dramatic move higher in Futu, of course, before you just started talking about it, why did this stand out more than some of the others? And are the others just too dangerous and difficult to short because of the kinds of moves which we've witnessed this week alone?CHANOS: Well, really our exposure in China has been in the last few years, has been pretty much as low as it's ever been because the excesses are here in the good old US of A and so that that's number one. Number two, I mean the Chinese market as you alluded to the FXI when we got bearish was was somewhere around $40. I think it's still around 32 or 33 after a big rally after 12 years. You know so this has been a very, very good place to be short as I keep telling people, but it's not the greatest place risk reward to be short now and that with, with some exceptions, obviously. The thing we do warn clients about though repeatedly and it was part of our Alibaba warnings back in 2016 is the VIE structure. You know all kinds of people come on your network and talk about Alibaba being cheap or JD.com being cheap or Baidu being cheap, and it's irrelevant. For Western investors, you do not own the company in the People's Republic of China. I can't stress that enough to people. We own a piece of paper in the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands that says you share the economics somehow. And and the Chinese love the VIE structure. They don't recognize it legally in effect, but they love it because it allows Western capital to come to their companies inside the People's Republic. The problem is the capital never goes back out the other way. And so we just warn people that you know, worst case environment, you have no recourse in the Chinese courts and it's just fraught with all kinds of governance issues that I think that most institutional investors are wise to avoid.PART IIWAPNER: We're back now with legendary investor, Jim Chanos of Kynikos. Jim, I want to get to some names. I want to start with DraftKings. What's your current position in DraftKings because you have had a bit of a feud with Jason Robins, the CEO, who has taken issue with the way that you've described some metrics of that company.CHANOS: Yeah, so, so my BFF Jason got quite upset. Had his lawyer sent me a nasty letter. And we made a mistake on your ""Halftime"" show. We multiplied the holdings of 800 million shares times the market cap. There are 800 million shares outstanding in DraftKings, but 400 million are held by Jason and are uneconomic, they are the super voting shares. So they are worth nothing in the eyes of the marketplace. I actually think they're worth something but that's a separate story. So, the market cap of DraftKings is not, is not at the time was not 20, 23 billion. It was 11 and a half billion and so he got quite upset with that. I would point out the stock from that appearance however, is down about 28% from 28 bucks to around $20. But this is kind of an important theme I want to get across to your viewers, for stocks that have gone down, what I want to point out is that a lot of fundamentals have actually dropped at or worse than actually the stocks have declined in some cases. So for example, if we take my friend Jason's company, the, the 2025 consensus EBITDA estimate in in early December when I was on the air with you, was $360 million. It is now $260 million. Interestingly, that's down about the same 28% that the stock is down. So, in effect DraftKings today is selling at the same 2025 EBITDA multiple as it was in December. And we have lots of stocks in our portfolio where the actual numbers have deteriorated dramatically since the fall and the stocks are down 30%, 40%. But on valuation metrics, they're they're at or above where they were in the fall. And I think that that's why the bubble stocks are so fraught with risk.WAPNER: But to be clear, you're still short. This name, right?CHANOS: Oh, oh, yes. DraftKings is one of my favorite shorts.WAPNER: Is that right?CHANOS: Yeah, they're, they're EBITDA since since since my appearance on your show that he was upset about, the the EBITDA loss for this year, the estimate is gone from 500 million to 900 million. So, things are getting worse. They're not better.WAPNER: Well the other issue that he had he, they pretty much accused you of being dishonest in the way that you've described what their price to sales multiple is. In reality, it's about 12 times you've described it, they've made the argument as 30 times and he took you to task for your math and that was after your last appearance on my show.CHANOS: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, Scott. We got the share count, half the shares are uneconomic. So the company is claiming you cannot count those in the market cap. And they're right.WAPNER: Oh, I got you. Okay. I just wanted to make sure we're talking about apples and apples. So you do admit that you had made a mistake on my program, the ""Halftime Report"" the last time that you were on.CHANOS: Well, I know it's shocking, but I sometimes make errors. They're not in bad faith.WAPNER: Okay, let me ask you this, your new short that you're going to reveal right here is what?CHANOS: Our new short is, is a kind of a one-off interesting situation. It's a little company called Coinbase.WAPNER: Okay, and why is Coinbase, why is Coinbase the one?CHANOS: So Coinbase is what I'm kind of talking about. Coinbase is what we would call one of the bubble stocks. Obviously, it's got a unique market niche as the, pretty much the only public crypto exchange and consequently has the valuation to go with it. So Coinbase is about a $40 billion market cap company. Stock was trading in the fall between $200 and $300, got down to about 150 recently, it's bounced, I think it closed somewhere around 185 today. But Coinbase is is again exactly what I'm referring to. So, in the fall when the stock was trading between 200 and 300, the adjusted EPS estimate for this year was $7. It's now, that same estimate, is now $3. So the so the multiple's actually got up. On a GAAP basis because of course like many tech stocks, they add back share base comp, on a GAAP basis, the estimate for this year has gone from $6 in the fall to a loss. We basically think Coinbase is over earning. If you do the numbers, their revenue base is roughly 3% to 4% of their custodian assets, their customer assets. They have a, over $200 billion of customer assets in their system. And if you look at comparable kinds of exchanges or trading operations, and Coinbase is an amalgam of a lot of these because it has different functions. You know, Charles Schwab has revenues of about 25 basis points of client assets. Trading operations, bank trading operations typically have revenues of 1% to 1.5% of assets. And there you have Coinbase at 3% to 4%. So we think that as competition increases in crypto and this is not a call on, on crypto or Bitcoin prices or anything like that, but we think as as competition increases amongst the exchanges, you're going to see fee compression, and as it is Coinbase will probably not be profitable this year with a $40 billion market cap.WAPNER: Is there a risk though that, look at times Coinbase has tracked Bitcoin that as Bitcoin recovers assuming it does and gets back to its high or even higher highs, does that put your thesis at all at risk?CHANOS: Yeah, that'd be, obviously, if it tracks, if it tracks Bitcoin as a sympathy play, it will do that, but what we're seeing is the economics are starting to diverge. And I think that's, that's kind of the important part and, and, and you can easily hedge out the Bitcoin risk if that's, if you correlate to Bitcoin, you want to take that systematic risk out you can do so.WAPNER: I mean the other thing this just this week, there are a couple positive research notes I wanted to read to you quickly. Oppenheimer says Coinbase has quote, ""Hidden value in the ventures business."" Needham was out today saying the NFT, or this week, said the NFT segment could add more than a billion dollars in revenues. I mean, obviously the street remains fairly optimistic about this one.CHANOS: Yeah, what are their profit estimates on those reports.WAPNER: Well I guess that's the million-dollar, billion-dollar question.CHANOS: Yeah so we're back to look we're back to people trying to get excited about things they got excited about last summer and they certainly have every right and ability to do that. But I think that the problem is, is that this market is so burned people in names that are not profitable, as Jim said at the beginning of your show. We're looking for companies where the the profit forecasts are continuing to decline as the valuations stay up in the stratosphere. There are plenty of companies that are in the new economy that have real growth, real cash flows with real earnings, but there's a lot that are just being sold on stories. And we would argue that Coinbase is one that's being sold on a story.WAPNER: We'll make that the last word, and we'll certainly follow those shares of Coinbase in the weeks ahead, Jim Chanos, thank you for being on in ""Overtime."" We'll see you soon.CHANOS: Congrats Scott on the new show.WAPNER: Appreciate it very much. That's Jim Chanos joining us."
2022-03-21,"Federal prosecutors said they were in plea negotiations with a New York couple recently arrested on charges of trying to launder $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin stolen in a hack.The talks were cited in a request by prosecutors asking a judge to postpone by 40 days a hearing for Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan and Ilya ""Dutch"" Lichtenstein in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.The couple were arrested on Feb. 8 in their Manhattan apartment.Prosecutors allege that the couple illegally tried to hide the source of almost 120,000 bitcoin stolen during the 2016 hack of the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange. Federal prosecutors on Monday said they were in plea negotiations with a New York couple recently arrested on charges of trying to launder $4.5 billion worth of stolen bitcoin cryptocurrency.The talks were cited in a request by prosecutors asking a judge to postpone by 40 days Friday's scheduled status hearing for the couple, Ilya ""Dutch"" Lichtenstein and Heather ""Razzlekhan"" Morgan, in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.Prosecutors said in a court filing that the postponement would ""facilitate ... plea discussions between the parties,"" as well as give them time to assemble and share evidence that could be used against the couple with their attorneys.Morgan, 31, was arrested with the 34-year-old Lichtenstein, on Feb. 8 in their Manhattan apartment. The arrests were on the same day the Justice Department has said it seized more than $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin that was part of the alleged laundering scheme.

Neither of the defendants is charged with the hack itself.At the time of the hack, the stolen bitcoin was worth $70 million. But the value of bitcoin has soared since then.Lawyers for the couple do not oppose the postponement of their hearing until May 4, according to Monday's filing by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.Prosecutors disclosed in court on Feb. 28 that they were discussing a possible ""resolution"" of Morgan's criminal case to avoid a trial.But until Monday, they had not publicly used the words ""plea discussions"" to describe those talks with her lawyers or attorneys for her husband. Attorneys for the couple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing.It is common for prosecutors and defense attorneys to discuss possible plea deals in criminal cases and for those discussions to lead to postponements of court hearings.But the couple's case is unusual for the relatively short time between their arrest and the disclosure of plea talks.Morgan, an aspiring rapper and entrepreneur, is free on a $3 million bond.Lichtenstein has been in jail since his arrest and has been denied bail.Netflix last month announced that a series on the couple will be directed by Chris Smith, who was executive producer of the company's Covid pandemic smash hit ""Tiger King."""

The bank traded a bitcoin-linked instrument called a non-deliverable option with crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, the firms said.The move is seen as a notable step in the development of crypto markets for institutional investors. Compared with the exchange-based CME Group bitcoin products Goldman began trading last year, the bank is taking on greater risk by acting as a principal in the transactions, according to the firms.""This trade represents the first step that banks have taken to offer direct, customizable exposures to the crypto market on behalf of their clients,"" said Galaxy co-President Damien Vanderwilt. Goldman Sachs is pushing further into the nascent market for derivatives tied to digital assets.The firm is the first major U.S. bank to trade crypto over the counter, CNBC was first to report. Goldman traded a bitcoin-linked instrument called a non-deliverable option with crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, the two firms said Monday.The move is seen as a notable step in the development of crypto markets for institutional investors, in part because of the nature of OTC trades. Compared with the exchange-based CME Group bitcoin products Goldman began trading last year, the bank is taking on greater risk by acting as a principal in the transactions, according to the firms.That Goldman, a top player in global markets for traditional assets, is involved is a signal of the increased maturity of the asset class for institutional players such as hedge funds, according to Galaxy co-President Damien Vanderwilt.""This trade represents the first step that banks have taken to offer direct, customizable exposures to the crypto market on behalf of their clients,"" Vanderwilt said in an interview. The options trades are ""much more systematically relevant to markets compared to cleared futures or other exchange-based products,"" Vanderwilt said. ""At a high level, that's because of the implications of the risk banks are taking on; they're implying their trust in crypto's maturity to date.""Hedge funds have been seeking derivative exposure to bitcoin, either to make wagers on its price without directly owning it, or to hedge existing exposure to it, the firms said. The market for these instruments is mostly controlled by crypto-native firms including Galaxy, Genesis and GSR Markets.""We are pleased to have executed our first cash-settled cryptocurrency options trade with Galaxy,"" Max Minton, Goldman's Asia Pacific head of digital assets, said in a statement. ""This is an important development in our digital assets capabilities and for the broader evolution of the asset class.""The bank has seen high demand for options tied to digital assets, Goldman's global head of crypto trading Andrei Kazantsev said in December.""The next big step that we are envisioning is the development of options markets,"" he said."
2022-03-21," About 45% of advisors say they expect to use cryptocurrencies in the future in response to client requests, according to Cerulli Associates.Just 7% of advisors say they are currently using these assets based on their own recommendations.A lack of regulation and other factors still prevent advisors from integrating these alternative assets. But not addressing them could potentially cost them clients, one expert says. Financial advisors have been reluctant to integrate cryptocurrency into client portfolios. They likely won't be able to ignore the alternative asset for much longer.Cerulli Associates, in a study, found that 45% of advisors say they expect to use cryptocurrencies in the future in response to client requests.Meanwhile, just 7% of advisors say they are currently using these assets based on their own recommendations, and 10% are using it because of client requests.Investors are curious about exposure to these assets, with 80% of advisors saying clients of all ages have asked them about cryptocurrencies, according to Cerulli.More from Personal Finance:Americans are pausing investments because of the Russia-Ukraine war46% of taxpayers plan to save their refunds this yearTax return backlog will 'absolutely' clear by end of 2022: IRS commissionerIn comparison, a June 2021 survey from the Financial Planning Association and the Journal of Financial Planning found about 49% of advisors said clients had asked about cryptocurrencies in the preceding six months.One key reason for increased investor interest: The surge in value cryptocurrencies saw last year.Their market capitalization climbed to $3 trillion in 2021, before falling to around $2 trillion this year.The free float market capitalization, which represents the amount of cryptocurrencies available for trading in the market, is around $1.3 trillion. Bitcoin and ethereum comprise much of that.""If advisors aren't including it or at least having some sort of stance on it, then they're placing themselves at a disadvantage and could potentially lose clients over it,"" said Matt Apkarian, senior analyst at Cerulli Associates. Yet financial advisors continue to be more bullish on other alternative assets.Private equity comprised 20.9% of advisors alternative asset distributions in 2021, while other private investments — debt, natural resources, infrastructure and real estate — represented 20.6%. Nontraded real estate investment trusts made up 18.6%.Cryptocurrency accounted for just 2.3% of advisors' alternative distributions.For 2023, advisors expect to boost alternatives exposure to infrastructure, with an anticipated 2.5% increase from their current allocation, as well as other areas like hedge funds and venture capital, with a 1.3% increase expected for each.Cryptocurrency exposure, however, is expected to increase by just 0.2%. There are reasons why financial advisors are reluctant to increase how much they devote to cryptocurrencies, Cerulli found.Some may shy away from it because they do not have the time it takes to understand the cryptocurrency market, while others may worry they could breach their fiduciary duty. Moreover, their platforms may not include cryptocurrencies as investment options.Notably, there is still a lack of regulation of these assets. The approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund may still take a few years, Apkarian said.Independent registered investment advisors may be able to integrate these assets first, due to more flexibility because of their size and management structure. However, large financial firms are also adding to their expertise in this space.In the meantime, individual investors may be able to access cryptocurrencies outside of their advisor relationship through platforms like Robinhood and Coinbase.It is up to advisors to make sure they have a full picture of their clients' exposures to cryptocurrencies, even if they don't have control of those assets, Apkarian said.""They can at least make sure that they have an understanding of what their clients have in outside assets,"" Apkarian said."
2022-03-22,"One of the most influential voices in cryptocurrency is sounding the alarm about the future of the space.Vitalik Buterin, who co-created Ethereum in 2013, said in an interview with Time Magazine published on Friday that he is worried about trends he has observed in the space, telling the publication that ""cypto itself has a lot of dystopian potential if implemented wrong.""One example of these trends is the explosion in the value of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, like the Bored Ape Yacht Club. ""The peril is you have these $3 million monkeys and it becomes a different kind of gambling,"" Buterin said.Lately, Buterin has made a concerted effort to speak out and try to ensure that Ethereum is still used for projects ranging from voting systems to urban planning, Time reported.""If we don't exercise our voice, the only things that get built are the things that are immediately profitable,"" he said. ""And those are often far from what's actually the best for the world.""Buterin came up with Ethereum, the blockchain that powers the cryptocurrency ether, in 2013 at age 19. It is now the second-largest cryptocurrency, with its $360.7 billion market cap second only to bitcoin's $808.8 billion, according to CoinGecko.Unlike bitcoin, which is often seen as a peer-to-peer payment system, Ethereum is capable of powering and building decentralized applications, like financial tools and social media platforms, along with NFTs, CNBC Make It previously reported.Though Buterin is influential in the crypto space, he doesn't have the power to single-handedly ensure his vision for Ethereum comes to fruition. The founder ""fundamentally rejects the idea that anyone should hold unilateral power"" over it, Time reports.It's not the first time that Buterin has gone public with concerns about cryptocurrency. Back in 2018, Buterin warned investors about the volatility of the space, telling people that ""traditional assets"" were still a better place to put their life savings.""Reminder: cryptocurrencies are still a new and hyper-volatile asset class, and could drop to near-zero at any time,"" he said.

LONDON — Over 50 cryptocurrency companies have been sent enforcement notices by the U.K.'s advertising watchdog as part of a regulatory crackdown on promotions in the industry.The Advertising Standards Authority said Tuesday it has told the firms to review their ads and make sure they are in compliance with the rules. It also threatened firms with targeted sanctions if ""problem ads"" persist after May 2.This would include reporting non-compliant advertisers to another regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.In its notice to the companies, the regulator gave guidance stating advertisers must make clear digital assets are unregulated in the U.K. Firms must not urge people to buy bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in their ads, or create the ""fear of missing out"" on an investment, the ASA added.The ASA didn't name the companies it has contacted, but said it has previously banned ads from the likes of crypto platform Coinbase and pizza chain Papa John's over concerns they misled consumers.""This is a 'red alert' priority issue for us and we've recently banned several crypto ads for misleading consumers and for being socially irresponsible,"" the ASA said in a statement Tuesday.It comes as Britain takes a tougher line on the crypto industry. The government in January said it would bring crypto ads under the same rules for financial promotions, a move that would require advertisers in the industry to be authorized by regulators. Regulators have also proposed limiting crypto ads in such a way that consumers may only respond to them if they qualify as high-net-worth individuals or sophisticated investors, a move that has been criticized by industry representatives.A consultation from the Financial Conduct Authority with the industry on regulation of crypto ads is set to expire on Wednesday.Global Digital Finance, an industry body that includes crypto exchanges Coinbase and Bitfinex, said it has sent a letter to U.K. Finance Minister Rishi Sunak expressing some concerns.""Rather than attempting to broaden the scope of existing legislation, stifling the market and attracting unintended consequences, a new bespoke regime should be implemented,"" Lavan Thasarathakumar, Global Digital Finance's director of government and regulatory affairs, said in the letter.""This regime would include obligations for how cryptoasset promotions should be communicated and more generally would provide clarity on how cryptoasset firms should conduct themselves and how regulators should supervise them.""Separately, a deadline for crypto firms to be registered with the FCA is set to elapse on Mar. 13.

2022-03-22,"Crypto investor Katie Haun has raised $1.5 billion for her new firm after a surprise departure from Andreessen Horowitz last year.It's the largest initial fund ever raised by a solo female founding partner, Pitchbook says.""It feels, honestly, like a lot of pressure. But I think that motivates everyone on the team,"" Haun says. ""Web3 is the new era of the internet and it deserves a new era of investors."" Crypto investor Katie Haun has raised $1.5 billion for her new fund after leaving Andreessen Horowitz, and shattered a record in the process.Haun Ventures' kickoff marks the largest debut venture fund ever raised by a solo female founding partner, according to Pitchbook. Former investment banker Mary Meeker held the prior record with a $1.3 billion fund after spinning out from Kleiner Perkins.""It feels, honestly, like a lot of pressure. But I think that motivates everyone on the team,"" Haun told CNBC in her first broadcast interview since leaving Andreessen Horowitz. ""Web3 is the new era of the internet, and it deserves a new era of investors.""The term Web3, or Web 3.0, loosely refers to general computing applications built on the blockchain — the same technology underlying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Examples include NFTs, which are traceable ownership certificates attached to digital files such as art pieces or videos, and decentralized finance applications, in which self-executing ""smart"" contracts can be used to replace middlemen like lawyers and bankers in certain types of transactions. But overall, the space is still in a very early and experimental phase.Haun Ventures will invest in both start-up equity, and in some cases the cryptocurrencies issued by those start-ups, also known as tokens.""That's something I've learned through being involved in deploying three other crypto funds: there's still a ton of potential in crypto and Web3 equity business models, but also token business models,"" she said. ""I don't think that you can really be a crypto investor without holding tokens.""  Haun's fund will be divvied up into two segments: $500 million for early-stage companies and protocols, and $1 billion for ""acceleration,"" or later-stage projects.Haun, a former federal prosecutor, became Andreessen's first female general partner in 2018 where she co-led its multiple cryptocurrency funds alongside Chris Dixon. Andreessen Horowitz will be a limited partner in Haun's newest fund, while Marc Andreessen, the firm's founder, and Dixon all personally contributed to her new endeavor.Her exit caught many in Silicon Valley off guard. While it was a ""dream job,"" Haun said the departure was about taking more of a risk, and ""stepping out of her comfort zone.""""Obviously there's a relationship there, and there are friendships there. We still intend to collaborate closely with Andreessen Horowitz,"" she said. ""One of the unique things about our fund size makes it so that we don't have to lead every deal, we can play well with a lot of other crypto investors -- founders don't want a single investor on their cap table, even in the early rounds.""Haun Ventures' nine-person team includes Chris Lehane, a former Airbnb executive and Clinton administration official, Tomicah Tillemann, a former staffer for President Joe Biden, and Rachael Horwitz, who led communications teams at Twitter, Google, Facebook and Coinbase. Multiple employees left Andreessen Horowitz with Haun for the new fund. She said the smaller team allows the firm to be more ""nimble,"" and act as ""venture contributors"" in addition to venture capitalists.""Gone are the days where founders just want capital,"" she said. ""One of the things that Haun Ventures will do for our founders is really actively contribute to the projects in which we invest.""The launch comes during a bear market for bitcoin. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down roughly 40% from its peak in November, with smaller cryptocurrencies like ether seeing deeper losses. Haun, who has invested through past downturns or ""crypto winters"", said there's still plenty of developer activity and upside.""When I think back to deploying the first two crypto funds, that was during a period of immense volatility -- it was definitely a crypto winter with prices down 70% and projects were still born that during that cycle,"" she said, highlighting Solana and NFT exchange OpenSea. ""One of the things I've learned as an investor with a long term view of the space, is that great products are going to be built and great protocols are going to be built, no matter what the prices are.""Crypto exchange Coinbase, which Haun is on the board of, has seen roughly 58% from drop its high last year. Still, Haun said private start-up valuations aren't being affected, yet.""There's a bit of a lag. We're still seeing very high valuations in crypto projects. Last time this happened, with macro market corrections, it took a while for that to translate over into crypto. I think the same could be true here,"" she said.While cryptocurrencies may be struggling to regain momentum, dollars flowing into private companies is at all-time highs. Blockchain start-ups brought in a record $25 billion in venture capital dollars last year, according to recent data from CB Insights. That figure is up eightfold from a year earlier.That flood of venture dollars has sparked some controversy on Twitter.Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey ⁠— two of the world's best-known tech billionaires ⁠— have been among those questioning ""Web3."" Dorsey argues VCs and their limited partners are the ones who will ultimately end up owning Web3 and it ""will never escape their incentives,"" he tweeted, calling it a ""centralized entity with a different label.""""I look at it as Web3 finally getting some of the critics it deserves in the space,"" Haun said. ""If I could have the choice between Jack Dorsey offering some critiques versus some of the myths that we've heard perpetrated for so long in the space, I would certainly choose the former. So I think that debate is healthy."""
2022-03-23,"The IRS has issued a warning about how to answer the cryptocurrency question on the front page of your tax return.You may respond no if you bought and held cryptocurrency with U.S. dollars, or transferred digital assets between your wallets. However, you'll need to check yes if you sold crypto, exchanged one virtual currency for another, used it for purchases, received it as payment, acquired it through mining or staking and more.   The IRS has issued a warning about how to answer the cryptocurrency question on the front page of your tax return.You'll need to respond to a yes-or-no question about virtual currency, regardless of whether you ""engaged in a transaction"" in 2021, according to the agency.And the wrong response may flag your return, said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Florida. The question reads: ""At any time during 2021, did you receive, sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any virtual currency?""You may respond no if you bought and held cryptocurrency with U.S. dollars, or transferred digital assets between your wallets.However, you'll need to say yes if you sold crypto, exchanged one virtual currency for another, used it for purchases, received it as payment, acquired it through mining or staking and more.""If you check yes, you're flagging yourself, and the IRS is going to be looking for some sort of capital gain or loss on your Schedule D,"" Lucas said, explaining how a mismatch may trigger a manual IRS review.More from Personal Finance:There are 4 weeks until the tax deadline. What filers need to knowIRS sent more than 45 million tax refunds. This is the average paymentTax return backlog will clear by end of 2022, IRS commissioner saysThere may be bigger issues if you have taxable activity and answer no, experts say.""That's where the hammer comes down because they can say that you lied on a government document under penalties of perjury,"" said Ryan Losi, a Richmond, Virginia-based CPA and executive vice president of accounting firm PIASCIK. If you're unclear on reporting, you may seek guidance from a tax professional with crypto expertise. But it may become more challenging as the April 18 deadline approaches. Cryptocurrency may be subject to capital gains when exchanged or sold at a profit. Swapping digital coins, cashing out for U.S. dollars or even making a purchase may be taxable events, Losi explained.The gain or loss is the difference between your purchase price, known as basis, and the value when selling or exchanging, and your tax rates depend on the length of ownership.  If you held digital assets for more than one year, you might qualify for long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your taxable income.However, many crypto investors sell or exchange more frequently, according to a CNBC survey, triggering short-term capital gains, levied at regular income tax rates, up to 37% for top earners.What's worse, figuring out your basis to calculate your crypto tax bill may not be easy with limited reporting from digital currency exchanges.   If you don't report taxable crypto activity and face an IRS audit, you may incur interest, penalties or even criminal charges.It may be considered tax evasion or fraud, said David Canedo, a Milwaukee-based CPA and tax specialist product manager at Accointing, a crypto tracking and tax reporting tool.While the chances of IRS scrutiny are lower due to limited staffing at the agency, officials may pursue larger amounts of money, he said.  For example, there's a big difference between buying bitcoin in 2012 and cashing out millions of dollars in 2021 versus small trades for $100 profit, Canedo said. But you have to disclose everything regardless. ""You're playing with fire if you don't report it,"" he said.Although the IRS has a three-year lookback for errors, there is no statute of limitations for fraud, Canedo said.Another risk is whistleblowers, who can report missing activity to the IRS for a percentage of penalties collected, Losi from PIASCIK said.""The No. 1 way the IRS finds out about tax cheats is a former business partner or former spouse,"" he said."
2022-03-23,"Nearly a quarter of Ukraine's population has been forced from their homes in the last four weeks. Many have turned to cryptocurrency to safeguard their cash, bring their money with them, accept remittances and donations, and to transact with each other for daily necessities. A Ukrainian refugee took a USB stick with him across the border containing 40% of his life savings, or about $2,000 in bitcoin.  On the morning that Russia went to war with Ukraine, Fadey woke up at 9am to a deluge of Telegram messages from friends asking him what was happening on the ground in the western city of Lviv. After a quick scan of the news, he realized his country was under siege. He decided to get out.Fadey is 20 years old and asked to be identified by a pseudonym to protect his privacy, because there is conscription for Ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60. Escaping duty on the frontline meant having to clear the border before officials had the chance to lock it down. To do that, he needed two things fast: A negative Covid test, and money. ""I couldn't withdraw cash at all, because the queues to ATMs were so long, and I couldn't wait that much time,"" Fadey told CNBC.So he turned to bitcoin instead.Fadey tells CNBC that he made a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange with a friend, trading $600 worth of his bitcoin savings for złoty, the Polish national currency, which he then used to pay for a bus across the border, a bed in a hostel for him and his girlfriend, and some food. The speed and ease of that crypto transaction proved instrumental. Within two hours of Fadey's safe passage into Poland, Ukraine closed its borders to all men of fighting age.Fadey also took a USB stick with him across the border containing 40% of his life savings, or about $2,000 in bitcoin. That thumb drive, combined with a unique passcode, became the key to his financial survival. ""I could just write my seed phrase on a piece of paper and take it with me,"" explained Fadey.

As the invasion proceeded, ATMs across the country started to run out of cash, and some people stood in line for hours only to face a $33 limit per transaction. Transferring money out of national bank accounts proved equally fruitless after the central bank suspended electronic cash transfers on the same day that Russia invaded the country.Add in closed borders, a rapidly depreciating currency, and the looming threat of a Russian takeover supplanting the Ukrainian hryvnia with the ruble, and it was a perfect use case for cryptocurrency.""In that part of the world, crypto – despite its volatility, despite the sentiments that the West has towards it – they don't ask, 'Why crypto?' They just ask, 'How?'"" said Brian Mosoff, CEO of Toronto-based crypto investment platform Ether Capital.""That's a very powerful thing for a group of people who don't have financial stability, or political stability right now. To be able to hold their net worth in some type of asset or product that essentially can be stored in a password."" Within hours of Russia's attack on Ukraine, the country's financial system began to show signs of strain.""The country's economy shut down within a matter of hours,"" said Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation, which has been supporting activists in Ukraine since 2009. ""Everything gets frozen. All of a sudden, it's a wartime economy. That happened in a matter of days. We're talking 24 to 48 hours,"" continued Gladstein.Fadey says he is unable to transfer his fiat-based savings to Poland, but crypto has blunted the impact. After his bitcoin holdings, the balance of his net worth is split between his monero stake, which he keeps on cryptocurrency exchange Binance, and his Ukrainian bank account.Alex Hammond, a free trade fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs, tells CNBC it was difficult to pull money out of Ukrainian banks for several weeks preceding the invasion. ""For many weeks prior to the invasion, most of the Ukrainian people I knew were actively trying to move as much money out of their Ukrainian bank accounts as possible, whether that be into UK banks, US banks, or crypto,"" continued Hammond, who spent several months in Ukraine in the last year and is currently in Poland.Maria Chaplia, for example, is a Ukrainian national now living in Poland. She originally got into cryptocurrency when her Ukrainian bank wouldn't let her move out an appreciable amount of money, and the fees that PayPal charged were higher than she wanted to pay. ""With crypto, it was much easier,"" she said.On the other side of the border, trying to access cash via banks yields similar friction. ""How are you going to access your Ukrainian bank account in Poland? Good luck,"" said Gladstein. Even with the laws passed to protect asylum seekers, Gladstein warns that most Ukrainian refugees won't be able to just walk into the Bank of Poland and open a bank account. ""Not everybody has a crypto wallet, but those who do are treating it like a bank account and transacting with it in these times of need,"" said Pablo Villalba, from Kimchi Fund, which invests in a mix of cryptocurrencies. Well before war gave Ukrainians a reason to turn to bitcoin, Ukraine was among the most progressive crypto jurisdictions on the planet. The country ranks fourth globally in terms of digital asset adoption, and earlier this month, it passed a law legalizing cryptocurrencies. Gladstein tells CNBC that Eastern Europe generally is big on digital assets, and Ukraine, in particular, is a known technology hotspot.""There were tons of Ukrainian exchanges, companies, even core developers,"" explained Gladstein. ""They all have phones. This is a highly connected, very IT-driven country. Very computer-literate. Very phone-literate, probably more than your average American.""That technical know-how has been especially helpful as Ukrainians turn to their crypto wallets as their sole on-ramp to banking.In Poland, for example, there are more than 175 bitcoin ATMs, allowing refugees who fled with bitcoin to cash it back out for fiat currency.Recent advancements in payment technology have also made it easier than ever to transact in cryptocurrency. The Lightning Network is a payments platform built on bitcoin's base layer that enables virtually instantaneous transactions.Some Ukrainians use it to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions, while others have found that Lightning is a cheap and fast way to receive donations and remittances from anywhere in the world.The payment process is simple and takes less than 60 seconds. Users can download an app like the Muun wallet, make a four-digit pin, and begin sending and receiving cryptocurrency payments simply by showing an QR code.""Me sitting in California, I can still send you any amount of money instantly to your phone anytime,"" said Gladstein. ""We don't have to worry about the fact that you're a refugee. It doesn't matter that you don't have a Polish passport or a bank account. None of these things matter."" Constantin Kogan is the co-founder of a blockchain-based gaming ecosystem, and he has team members based in both Ukraine and Russia. Kogan tells CNBC that one of his Ukrainian employees stayed put, but sent his wife and children to the border with a crypto wallet.This employee wasn't sure where his family was – or which border they had crossed – but he did have a plan for their financial security: make regular deposits into his wife's crypto wallet. He keeps the bulk sum of his net worth (about 60%) in crypto, mostly stablecoins.Chaplia says that many of her friends in Ukraine are ""very, very deep into crypto,"" but for her, moving some of her cash into bitcoin, ethereum, and tether served like digital gold: A way to store it for safety and forget about it. ""I used to be skeptical of crypto, I have to admit, but because of the war, I had to give it a chance,"" she said."

The deal values Credit Kudos at around $150 million, one of the people said.The news was first reported by crypto-focused media outlet The Block.A spokesperson for Apple said the U.S. tech giant ""buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans."" Credit Kudos was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.Based in London, Credit Kudos develops software that uses consumers' banking data to make more informed credit checks on loan applications. It is a challenger to the big credit reporting agencies, which include Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.The deal could have serious implications for some of Credit Kudos' clients, which include the London-based fintech firms Curve and Fronted. Credit Kudos had been in discussions about a possible sale as early as September, one of the people told CNBC.The company operates in a nascent space in the world of fintech known as ""open banking,"" where third-party firms securely link to people's bank accounts to extract information and make payments on their behalf, provided they've got consent to do so.The trend has gained momentum in Europe in recent years thanks to fintech-friendly rules introduced in 2018 that aim to increase competition in the payments industry. It has ignited huge interest from investors, with Silicon Valley start-up Plaid being valued at $13.4 billion in a funding round last year.Plaid had previously agreed to be bought by Visa, but scrapped those plans following an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. government. Visa subsequently acquired Tink, a Swedish company that competes with Plaid, for $2.1 billion. It's not yet clear what Apple has planned for Credit Kudos. The company has made significant inroads into financial services over the years through its Apple Pay mobile wallet and the Apple Card, a credit card the firm launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs in the U.S.Credit Kudos, which last received venture capital funding in early 2020, has raised a total of £7.8 million to date, according to Crunchbase data. The firm racked up losses of £4.5 million ($5.9 million) in its 2020 financial year, double the £2.2 million it lost in 2019, according to a Companies House filing.- CNBC's Sam Shead contributed to this report"

2022-03-24,"BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the war in Ukraine could accelerate the adoption of digital currencies by central banks in his annual letter to shareholders Thursday.Fink didn’t mention any specific cryptocurrencies but wrote about the potential of central bank digital currencies. Russia's invasion of Ukraine could accelerate the adoption of digital currencies by central banks, according to BlackRock's Larry Fink.The CEO of the $10 trillion-asset money manager called it one of the ""less discussed"" outcomes of the war, which began one month ago, in his annual letter to shareholders Thursday.""The war will prompt countries to re-evaluate their currency dependencies,"" he said. ""Even before the war, several governments were looking to play a more active role in digital currencies and define the regulatory frameworks under which they operate.""Fink cited the U.S. Federal Reserve as an example, which recently published a white paper examining the pros and cons of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency.""A global digital payment system, thoughtfully designed, can enhance the settlement of international transactions while reducing the risk of money laundering and corruption,"" Fink added. ""Digital currencies can also help bring down costs of cross-border payments, for example when expatriate workers send earnings back to their families."" After the war began and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia targeting its central bank, crypto was thrusted into the spotlight. Transactions on centralized bitcoin exchanges in both the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia surged to their highest levels in months after the war began, and stablecoins like Tether showed they can play a more important role as a safe haven asset – or in circumventing sanctions.BlackRock clients have shown ""increasing interest"" in digital currencies, including stablecoins and ""the underlying technologies"" – also known as blockchain – Fink said. The company has been studying the emerging asset class to ""to understand how they can help us serve our clients"" as a result.Fink didn't specify any particular digital currencies the company is studying. Digital currency as a group has broken out into several different emerging asset classes in the past year including bitcoin itself, other alternative cryptocurrencies, smart contracts platforms like Ethereum, decentralized finance tokens, central bank digital currencies, stablecoins and NFTs.The BlackRock CEO has previously spoken with optimism about the future of ""digital currencies"" but has remained cautious about bitcoin and its volatility. In November he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" he's ""not a student of bitcoin and where it's going to go"" but added ""I do believe there is a huge role for a digitized currency."""
2022-03-24,"If some of the internet buzz around NFTs feels shady to you, you're not alone. Internet searches for ""NFT scams"" hit all-time highs in early February, according to Google Trends.You could be forgiven for thinking that nonfungible tokens — which allow internet users to purchase and own internet-based content, such as images and videos — are a scam altogether. A studio audience recently sat in confused silence as Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton compared ""Bored Ape"" NFTs. That the pair of digital monkey images collectively fetched north of half a million dollars of the celebs' money may have you thinking that this whole thing is detached from reality.More from Grow:What are NFTs? Why investors are spending millions on digital artWhy investors are ‘better off buying than bailing’ when markets are choppyInvestors who ignore meme stock risks may ‘pay a price,’ says profBut plenty of investors are seeing the value in NFTs. Some want to own rare digital collectibles. Others are fans of the art they're purchasing. Still others believe that the technology that allows internet users to track the provenance and ownership of things online is the future of the internet. Investing experts caution against investing much more than you're willing to lose in NFTs, since they're speculative investments whose value is determined almost entirely by investor demand.No matter your reason for getting into NFTs, you need to remember one thing: Where there is money to be made, fraudsters abound. ""People come in and think it's like Disney World — no one is bad and everyone is cool,"" says Franck Bossi of NFT Watchdog. ""But there are many scams, and people forget to look at important specifics.""Here's how experts say you can protect yourself. Once you join NFT communities, be prepared to hear from a lot of folks looking to hype their projects, says NFT Club cofounder Adam Morris. ""NFT guys will typically hype NFTs on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and Reddit,"" he says.This is where scammers lurk as well, he adds. ""They will often join Discord servers and mass-message their members, DM people on Twitter, or make connections on apps like Bumble Bizz,"" he says. ""They will do their best to sell their scam as the next big marketing opportunity.""The scam messages you'll receive will take a few common forms, says Morris. You may be offered an NFT in exchange for sending cryptocurrency to a particular online wallet, and never receive it.Or you may be asked for help in marketing an ""up-and-coming"" collection or to work alongside an exciting new creator. When you send crypto to help ""mint"" the new collection of NFTs, the project will disappear completely.Morris says that once you join NFT communities on Discord, for example, you will likely receive dozens of messages a day about potential NFT opportunities. ""While some may be legitimate, it is generally a good idea to avoid all direct messages,"" he says. Video by Ian Wolsten So if the general advice is to avoid jumping at opportunities being pitched in your DMs, where do you shop for NFTs? A good place to start, experts say, is on trusted online NFT marketplaces, such as LooksRare and OpenSea. ""Neither will take custody of either the NFT or the cryptocurrency used to trade,"" says Morris. ""The platforms exist to create a safe place for people to buy and sell their assets.""From there, however, you still need to take some precautions. Be careful navigating to either site: Both messages from scammers and sponsored ads atop your google search results may contain lookalike links. You're better off navigating directly to their websites.And even when you're on a legitimate site, scammers may try to trick you with copycat versions of prominent projects. Look for blue checkmarks next to projects, which indicate that they're verified on the NFT platforms. Even if an NFT project isn't an outright scam, its creators may be looking to make a quick buck at your expense, says Bossi. While some projects seek to create long-term value for investors, others aim to rapidly onboard buyers to pump up the price of the NFTs before selling for a quick profit. If you're still holding at that point, the value of your NFT could shrink to nothing.The ""check under the hood"" of an NFT project is to look at its ""roadmap"" — a document that outlines the goals and spending priorities of the NFT's creators. The roadmap behind any NFT you buy should be transparent about who is behind the project and what they intend to do with your money. ""An NFT may have great art, but would you spend money on a painting if you didn't know who the artist was?"" says Bossi. Video by Mariam AbdallahAnother red flag: Major portions of the project's budget are earmarked for marketing and giveaways. ""If they're trying to get a lot of people to buy because one of them is going to win $200,000 in Ethereum, we know something is fishy,"" he says. ""We know that people are just here for the money.""Bossi acknowledges that even legitimate projects may serve as poor investments. ""99% of NFT projects out there are probably going to fail,"" he says. But to have a chance at earning long-term value from your investment, avoiding the projects that will seek to pull the proverbial rug out from under you is key. ""The ones that will create real value are the ones with a business plan,"" he says. ""There's no guarantee it will work, but at least they'll have a chance to create something that will produce value for investors later on.""Investing involves risk, including the loss of principal. The products and websites referenced above are not an endorsement of their services and do not ensure profit or guarantee against loss.

""We don't see that happening at this point.""Asked about the role cryptocurrencies are playing in the Russian-Ukraine war, Yellen said she continues to view crypto through her duty to safeguard American consumers. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday said she does not believe the U.S. should impose sanctions on China because of its ties to Russia.""I don't think that that's necessary or appropriate,"" the Treasury secretary said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" of potential penalties on Beijing. ""Senior administration officials are talking privately and quietly with China to make sure that they understand our position.""""We would be very concerned if they were to supply weapons to Russia, or to try to evade the sanctions that we've put in place on the Russian financial system and the central bank,"" she said. ""We don't see that happening at this point.""The Treasury secretary's remarks come as NATO leaders step up their efforts to warn China against enabling Russia's assault on Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies have for weeks warned Beijing that it would face severe consequences if it would aid Moscow by providing arms, offering alternative trade routes or creating disinformation campaigns.China has not fully denounced Russia's unprovoked attack on its neighbor, and like Russian President Vladimir Putin, has complained about NATO's expansion. U.S. officials have also said that Russia has asked China for military and economic assistance, a charge both countries deny.President Joe Biden last week threatened Chinese leader Xi Jinping with unspecified consequences if Beijing supports Moscow as it works to capture the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.While it is unclear how the White House would penalize China, it would likely call on the Treasury Department to expand its economic sanctions.In the interview, Yellen also touched on how both Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic have emphasized the importance of securing U.S. supply chains.""Maybe American businesses have focused on efficiency and organizing supply chains in ways that lower costs but impair resilience,"" she said. ""And resiliency in supply chains is a high priority of the administration.""

2022-03-25," Experts say you should have at least six months' worth of expenses set aside in an emergency fund.If you don't have that much cash, you're not alone. Surveys show many people would have a hard time covering an unexpected emergency expense with savings.You may not have to make more money just to set more aside.Try these tips that can help make the most of your income. Having an emergency savings fund should be a top goal in order to be able to cushion an unexpected financial blow without going broke, according to experts.Still, many people are falling short.A Bankrate study found just 44% of people are prepared to pay for an unexpected $1,000 expense with cash. More than one-third of people would need to borrow the funds.The ideal number to shoot for is at least three months to six months' worth of living expenses, according to certified financial planner Ted Jenkin, CEO at Atlanta-based Oxygen Financial. If you're more financially conservative, you may want to put a year's worth away.

Here's whyDemand may push advisors to turn to cryptocurrencies Finding that extra income may sound like a high hurdle, especially in an uncertain economy and amid high inflation.The good news is you may be able to set more cash aside just by changing how you handle the resources you already have. Chances are, big savings can be found by reassessing your day-to-day expenses.Jenkin, who co-wrote a book called ""The 21-Day Budget Cleanse,"" recommends people take a detox approach to their household budgets.Look at the 21 largest bills you have — if you have that many — and try to shop around or change them. Take your bundled internet, phone and cable bill, for example. Ask your provider if there is an opportunity for a better package or rate. Also investigate the other options available through other companies.""Most people really haven't taken the time to see where they're overspending and size up what the difference is,"" Jenkin said. Credit card balances can cost you north of 20%, if you're not careful.The truth is you do not need more than two credit cards, unless you're a business owner, Jenkin said.As such, Jenkin recommends starting with what he calls ""plastic surgery"" — cutting up your cards until there are just two left.Then, reassess any rewards you've accumulated to see how you can turn them into extra funds.That could include an Amazon gift card or points to help whittle down your credit card bill. Many people have unused perks that they have not tapped into during the coronavirus.""I don't think people are looking at it,"" Jenkin said. ""It's found money."" Even with interest rates still at record lows, a savings account at an online or local community bank remains the best place to make sure you'll be able to access the money when you need it, Jenkin said.If you lose your job or start a business, you're going to want quick access to your cash.""You can't afford to put it into crypto or the stock market,"" Jenkin said. ""Doing that over three or six months is gambling."" If you haven't used something in a year — aside from family heirlooms or holiday decorations — it's time to sell it, Jenkin said.If you haven't worn a shirt in a year, for example, you can unload it on a website such as Poshmark. Electronics you're not using can be sold on sites such as Decluttr or Facebook, Jenkin said. ""There's many, many apps and websites to basically sell your stuff,"" Jenkin said.If you're not ready to part with an item forever — such as an extra car, for example — you may want to consider renting it out instead on a website like Turo. Generating more money doesn't have to stop at selling your things; you can also sell your skills, Jenkin said.Websites like Fiverr will let you list your services so you can generate extra money.""If you have a hustle, skill or talent, try to earn that extra income to build up a cash reserve,"" Jenkin said."

2022-03-26,"ExxonMobil has been working with Denver-based Crusoe Energy Systems to mine bitcoin in North Dakota for over a year, according to people with knowledge of the project.The pilot program, which is operating in the Bakken region, launched in late January 2021 and had begun expanding by July.ConocoPhillips is pursuing similar work in the same area. ExxonMobil, the top oil and gas producer in the U.S., is piloting a project to mine bitcoin in North Dakota, according to people with knowledge of the matter.For over a year, Exxon has been working with Crusoe Energy Systems, a company based in Denver, said the people who asked not to be named because details of the project are confidential. Crusoe's technology helps oil companies turn wasted energy, or flare gas, into a useful resource.Similar to ConocoPhillips' mining scheme in North Dakota's Bakken region, Exxon is diverting natural gas that would otherwise be burned off into generators, which convert the gas into electricity used to power shipping containers full of thousands of bitcoin miners. Exxon launched the pilot in late January 2021 and expanded its buildout in July.While Exxon hasn't talked publicly about its work in the space, Eric Obrock, a 10-year veteran at the company, said on his LinkedIn profile that from February 2019 to January 2022, he ""proposed and led the first successful commercial and technical demonstration of using Bitcoin Proof-of-Work mining as a viable alternative to natural gas flaring in the oil patch.""Obrock's title on his profile is NGL industry outlook advisor, referring to the natural gas liquids market. Obrock told CNBC through a LinkedIn message that he's been advised that he can't speak to the media on this topic. Exxon didn't respond to a request for comment.Exxon's bitcoin project isn't really about making money from the cryptocurrency. Rather, the company has pledged to reduce emissions as part of an industrywide effort to meet higher environmental demands. In early March, Exxon joined other oil companies in committing to the World Bank's ""Zero Routine Flaring by 2030"" initiative introduced in 2015.The type of crypto mining arrangement it's pursuing with Crusoe reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared with continued flaring.Exxon's bitcoin mining work in North Dakota was first reported by Bloomberg, which said the company is also considering similar pilots in Alaska, the Qua Iboe Terminal in Nigeria, Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field, Guyana and Germany. The problem Exxon and Conoco are addressing has existed for years: What happens when drillers accidentally hit a natural gas formation?Unlike oil, which can be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is close to a pipeline, producers can sell it right away. But if the pipe is full or if the gas is 20 miles away, drillers often burn it off. That's why you typically see flames rising from oil fields.In addition to the environmental hazards, drillers are also burning cash.Enter bitcoin mining, which only requires an internet connection and can be done from anywhere. And because miners' primary variable cost is energy, they're incentivized to find the cheapest sources of power. ""This is just a great way to bring that demand to the wasted energy and solve two problems at once,"" said Cully Cavness, president of Crusoe, whose backers include Valor Equity Partners, one of Tesla's largest investors. ""Solve the energy appetite of bitcoin and solve the stranded energy, flare gas problem for the energy industry.""Cavness said Crusoe has 150 employees and works with Norway's Equinor ASA, Canadian oil producer Enerplus and Devon Energy, based in Oklahoma City. Permits from North Dakota's Division of Air Quality show Crusoe can run 20 portable engines, with 11 currently in use at well sites across the state. Two of the engines are operational at wells run by XTO Energy, Exxon's oil and gas fracking subsidiary, at the Jorgenson Deep Creek Site. Cavness said most of Crusoe's 80-plus data centers are deployed in the Bakken.""We're really moving the needle on flared volumes,"" Cavness said. ""More than 10 million cubic feet of gas per day that would be flared is not flared because we've deployed our systems.""The World Bank, in its most recent Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership report, recognized Crusoe as offering an innovative solution to flaring. The Bakken formation became an important source of new oil production in the U.S. in the last couple decades with the boom in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Craig Thorstenson has been working at the permitting program at North Dakota's Division of Air Quality since 1989. He says North Dakota has always been an oil state to some extent, but growth in the Bakken lifted the state to second in the country, before it slipped to third last year.Thorstenson, who was born and raised in Bismarck, the state capital, said the change ""was quite a shock for us."" Residential housing couldn't keep up with demand.""We were having a population boom,"" Thorstenson said. ""People coming in, wanting to get jobs. People living in the Walmart parking lots.""More drilling meant more wasted gas, which affected the entire Williston Basin that spreads across part of Montana, the Dakotas and into Canada. That's a big reason why Crusoe invested heavily in the area.""At points in not-that-distant history, the basin was flaring almost up to a fifth of the gas that was being produced there,"" said Cavness.Thorstenson said the amount of wasted natural gas is finally trending lower. In a March report, North Dakota's Department of Natural Resources estimated that currently 93% to 94% of natural gas is being captured. In 2014, the commission had a capture goal of 74%.Drillers have historically chosen flaring as a way to dispose of excess gas because it's less damaging to the environment than venting, which releases methane directly into the air and produces greenhouse effects that have proven to be 84 to 86 times as powerful as CO2 over a 20-year period.Even with flaring, some methane does escape due to wind and other factors. On-site bitcoin mining can be especially impactful, because 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Adam Ortolf, who runs business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities. ""Nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,"" Ortolf said. ""So unless it's economically sustainable, producers won't internally combust the gas.""Crusoe's systems are built to make the process financially viable for drillers. The company brings its equipment onto the oil pad, allowing it to convert otherwise wasted natural gas into electricity, which then powers computing at the well site.""When we put it through our generator, we get up to 99.9% combustion of that methane,"" Cavness said. ""Not only are we using the otherwise wasted energy, we're also significantly reducing methane emissions.""Cavness said his main takeaway from the United Nations' latest global climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, was that methane is the low-hanging fruit.""That's the thing we want to solve as an energy industry,"" he said.WATCH: Texas crypto miners power down to ease grid pressure"

The IRS is backlogged and still sifting through tens of millions of pending returns, including many of last year's filings. If your 2020 return is part of the pileup, there's a special step for your 2021 electronic filing.The agency processed more than 61.9 million returns as of March 11, with the majority filed digitally and roughly half self-prepared, the IRS reported.When you self-prepare electronically, the IRS validates your filing with the previous year's adjusted gross income. However, there's a different process for the millions of filers with a pending 2020 return.More from Personal Finance:There's a tricky cryptocurrency question on your tax returnAs states consider gas tax holidays, don't expect big savingsThere are 4 weeks until the tax deadline. What filers need to knowIf last year's return is still in limbo, you'll need to enter $0 for your 2020 AGI when filing online, said National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins in a hearing with the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee.""That way you can file electronically, and you don't have to file a paper return,"" she said. ""We need to get that message out to taxpayers.""While these directions only apply to digital filers, the agency urges everyone to file electronically with direct deposit to avoid delays.Nearly 94.3% of individual tax returns were filed electronically during the fiscal year 2020, according to the IRS.And there are similar instructions for non-filers, who typically include certain Social Security recipients or those with yearly income below the standard deductions. If you used the non-filer tool in 2021 to collect the advance child tax credit payments or your stimulus check, the IRS says to put $1 for last year's AGI.  ""I would think hardly anybody knows about that one,"" said certified financial planner Larry Harris, director of tax services at Parsec Financial in Asheville, North Carolina.If you don't follow these instructions, the IRS may not accept your electronic return, said Tommy Lucas, a CFP and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Florida.""We've seen that from individuals trying to file themselves,"" he said, explaining how AGI conflicts may trigger a confusing rejection email from their tax-filing software.   Your return may also be pending if you received a CP80 notice about a missing 2020 return.If you got this notice and it still hasn't been accepted, you should enter $0 for your 2020 AGI when filing this season, said Lucas.""They're going to show $0 in their system, so that's what I would start with,"" he said. But if the IRS rejects your return with a 2020 AGI of $0, they may have processed last year's return after sending the notice, Lucas said, meaning you can refile your 2021 return with your actual 2020 AGI.While it may be difficult to reach the IRS by phone, you can double-check the status of your 2020 tax return by downloading a free IRS transcript from your online account."
2022-03-26,"Winning an Academy Award is often considered the most prestigious honor you can receive in Hollywood.Earning an Oscar can instantly allow actors to command as much as 20% more money on their next project. But although taking home the top prize in one of the top acting categories can be career-changing, the trophy itself is worth less than a cup of coffee.That's because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which gives out the Oscars, has strict rules in place to prevent winners from profiting off of the sale of their trophies.In fact, according to the Academy's official regulations, winners are not allowed to ""sell or otherwise dispose of the Oscar statuette ... without first offering to sell it to the Academy for the sum of $1.""And if an Oscar winner dies and passes their award down to their children, those heirs must also abide to the same rules and cannot sell or give away the statuette.These rules were first introduced in 1951, and are in place to ""preserve the integrity of the Oscar symbol,"" the Academy says in its materials.Oscars that were awarded prior to the introduction of the rule are technically fair game for collectors. In 1999, Michael Jackson paid $1.54 million for the best picture Oscar awarded to ""Gone With the Wind"" in 1940. And in 2011, the 1942 Oscar that ""Citizen Kane"" was awarded for its screenplay sold at auction for $861,542.In addition to restricting what winners can do with their trophies, the Academy has also ""carefully limited reproductions of the Oscar statuette."" The Los Angeles Times reported in 2016 that the Academy has sued candy shops for making chocolate replicas of Oscar statuettes and gone after awards websites that use ""Oscar"" in their names.The 94th Academy Awards will be held Sunday, March 27.

LONDON — The U.K. government will soon reveal plans to regulate the cryptocurrency market, focusing on a fast-growing type of token known as stablecoins, according to four industry sources familiar with the matter.British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to make an announcement in the coming weeks about a new regulatory regime for crypto, the sources told CNBC, preferring to remain anonymous as the information hasn't yet been made public.The Treasury declined to comment when asked about the plans by CNBC.Details of the plans are still being finalized, however sources who spoke to CNBC say they are likely to be favorable to the industry, providing legal clarity for a sector that has so far been mostly lacking in regulation.According to the sources, Treasury officials have shown a willingness to understand the complexities of the crypto market and so-called stablecoins, digital assets that derive their value from existing currencies like the U.S. dollar.The department has been in discussions with a number of firms and trade groups. That includes the Winklevoss brothers' crypto exchange Gemini, one of the sources said. Gemini issues its own stablecoin called the Gemini dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.

Tether, the world's largest stablecoin, now has a total circulating supply of more than $80 billion — up from about $4 billion two years ago.But those tokens have also caused concern for regulators, who worry they may not be fully backed by an equivalent amount of reserves, and are being used for money laundering and other illicit activities.Meanwhile, regulators are worried about possible exposure of the financial system to bitcoin and other digital currencies, as well as their potential use for evading sanctions imposed on Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. The Bank of England on Thursday called for policymakers to expand regulatory frameworks to limit the risks posed by crypto to financial stability.BOE Deputy Governor Sam Woods wrote a letter to several bank CEOs saying there has been ""increased interest"" from banks and investment firms in ""entering various crypto markets.""The Treasury's move is being viewed as a response to President Joe Biden's executive order calling for coordination from different U.S. federal agencies on regulating crypto, the sources said. Several industry insiders have bemoaned the lack of similar action from the U.K. A number of companies, including Revolut, Blockchain.com and Copper could be forced to wind down their crypto operations in the U.K. this week if they fail to make it onto the Financial Conduct Authority's cryptoasset register in time for a Mar. 31 deadline.The FCA said a ""high number"" of crypto businesses aren't meeting the required anti-money laundering standards.

2022-03-27,"This has been CNBC's live blog covering the 94th annual Academy Awards. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was hoping that moviegoers would be riveted by surprises at Sunday's Oscars ceremony. But they probably didn't bank on a physical confrontation between two superstars.The academy was hoping that movie lovers would unite and spark an uptick in ratings for the 94th Academy Awards. Late into the ceremony, however, comedian Chris Rock told a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's hair, which prompted her spouse, Will Smith, to march up to the stage and smack Rock while he was about to present the best documentary award. ABC cut out the mics just as the two started shouting at each other, but uncensored international feeds picked up the two stars yelling profanities at each other. Moments later, Smith won the Oscar for Best Actor and apologized to the academy and his fellow nominees.

It last traded 6.7% higher at $47,914.35, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day it traded above $48,000, for the first time since Dec. 31.The digital currency has been rising since Friday, gaining nearly 7% in that time.""Throughout the last six months, crypto has shown its resilience and relevancy, even as strong macroeconomic headwinds have disrupted traditional markets by remaining within range. Now, crypto is center stage with its biggest opportunity to shine,"" said Chris Kline, chief operating officer and co-founder of Bitcoin IRA, told CNBC's ""Crypto World.""""Crypto is not trading in a vacuum,"" he added. ""Geopolitical uncertainty, inflation, and a serious potential for a recession are giving both retail and institutional investors a reason to build a defensive strategy. Crypto is playing an integral role in that plan.""While there isn't one particular catalyst for the moves, there have been several bullish developments for bitcoin in the past week alone showing evidence of institutional demand for more exposure to the digital asset.

It has been buying more bitcoin for it each day, including more than $100 million in bitcoin on Monday.Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank, noted that the bitcoin futures market was accumulating short positions when the price fluctuated below $40,000, which resulted in about $71 million in liquidations on Sunday.""From a technical perspective, bitcoin has broken out of an ascending triangle, which signals an upward trend, and likely will continue to rally in the short term,"" he said.He added the market should proceed with caution ahead of the Personal Consumption Expenditures report and jobs report later this week, noting that the results could lead to a 50 basis point rate hike at the next FOMC meeting.

PALM BEACH, Fla. – The NFL's annual meetings kicked off Sunday, and they are already generating some big announcements.The league said Monday that its 2024 draft would be held in Detroit, and teams are primed to start seeking blockchain sponsorship deals this week.NFL sponsorship revenue reached nearly $2 billion for the 2021 season, and blockchain deals should increase that figure next season. Last week, the league said it would loosen its rules against teams making deals with companies that work with blockchain, the ledger technology that undergirds cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.Teams are still banned from cryptocurrency sponsorships, however.""This is a little bit what we can learn from the marketplace versus us going out and acting like we know everything,"" NFL Chief Revenue Officer Rennie Anderson said.

Anderson asked.MLB became the latest U.S. pro league to include the asset, which could bring baseball clubs $11 million per year. The NBA installed patches in 2017 and generated roughly more than $150 million. And the NHL is further rolling out its patch program in 2023.""It's great that the other leagues do that because they can test it out for us,"" she added. ""But I can't imagine (Los Angeles Rams quarterback) Matthew Stafford hoisting the (Vince) Lombardi Trophy with a third-party brand on his chest. The need isn't there."" The league plans to roll out its newest asset to potential partners this week, Anderson told CNBC.Last week, the league announced NFL clubs are permitted to seek blockchain sponsorships with platforms like Coinbase and FTX. Anderson said the assets could lure multiple partners to hold rights, including the NFL's ""official digital wallet"" and ""official blockchain"" partners. She called the category an ""endless opportunity"" but added the NFL is still learning about the technology.In addition to its cryptocurrency applications, blockchain tech effectively gives virtual collectibles like nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, unique and nonhackable certificates of authenticity.""I think we'll learn a lot about the use cases about how it can transform our future,"" Anderson said.When it comes to cryptocurrency, though, Anderson echoed other NFL executives about its future. Though leagues like the NBA appear all-in on crypto, Anderson said the NFL would ""protect the business"" and ease into the sector. That could come as government officials figure out regulations around crypto.""We don't have to be the first,"" said Anderson. ""But when we do something, we've got to get it right."" The league announced Monday that NFL draft would be held in April 24 at the Campus Martius Park in downtown Detroit.Detroit was a finalist for the event in 2022 NFL Draft, which will be located in Las Vegas. The 2023 draft will be held in Kansas City.Last year, the NFL Draft was held in Cleveland and generated had an economic impact for the region of roughly $42 million, according to the Cleveland Sports Commission. That's down from the 2019 NFL Draft held in Nashville, which generated more than $200 million. The 2020 NFL Draft was virtual due to the pandemic.Asked to project the economic impact of the 2024 event, Lions CEO Rod Wood didn't reveal specific figures but said ""it'll be significant.""The franchise was also selected as the featured team for the 2022 ""Hard Knocks"" documentary series on HBO. The season premieres on Aug. 9."
2022-03-28,"With the April 18 deadline coming up for most tax filers, there are a few ways to get your refund as soon possible, including filing electronically and avoiding errors in your return, such as typos or incorrectly reporting your income.If you file electronically, most refunds will be delivered within 21 days. But if you mail a paper return to the IRS, it can take up to eight weeks to process. Aside from the way you file, you'll also want to make sure that what you file is done correctly. With that in mind, here are six common errors to avoid, from tax experts and the IRS itself. Taxpayers choose between five filing statuses: single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household and qualifying widow or widower with dependent children. Your filing status can affect how much you pay, and while multiple different statuses may be allowed for your situation, one could result in a higher tax burden. Use this tool to determine the filing status that results ""in the lowest amount of tax,"" according to the IRS. A dependent can be either a qualifying child or a qualifying relative, and comes with tax breaks that can lower how much you owe. But it can be confusing to know whether you can claim certain people as dependents.For example, divorced parents may both try to claim their child, even though two people cannot claim the same dependent. In that case, ""there's going to be a problem,"" says Riley Adams, a certified public accountant who runs Young and the Invested, a website focused on financial literacy.Before claiming a dependent, make sure that they actually qualify for that tax status and that no one else in the household is claiming them. If you're not sure if someone in your household qualifies as a dependent, this questionnaire-based IRS tool can help you figure it out. Near the top of your Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR, you'll see this question about virtual currencies: ""At any time during 2021, did you receive, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in any virtual currency?""The language of this question has confused taxpayers in the past, Adams says. But what it's asking is simple: You should check ""yes"" on the form if you sold cryptocurrencies, exchanged one cryptocurrency for another, used crypto to buy something or received it as payment, says Adams.""If you didn't sell it or exchange it, or if you transfer it to your digital wallet, you don't have to click 'yes' on this,"" he adds. Underreporting income may lead to penalties and interest, so it's best to get the amount right before you file. Don't forget to include income from freelance work, not just the amount on the W-2 form provided by your main employer. Employers will typically send freelancers a Form 1099 that includes the amount they were paid.Keep in mind that employers aren't legally obligated to report your earnings to the IRS unless the amount paid exceeds $600, but they sometimes still do, says Adams. For that reason, you should report all your freelance income, no matter how small. Unfortunately, many people are surprised to learn that their unemployment benefits are taxed as ordinary income. A special law exempted some of this tax in 2020, but that was for a limited time and does not apply to 2021 tax returns. You should report any unemployment compensation that you received in 2021 on your tax return under ""Additional Income."" If you're using tax software, you'll be asked about your unemployment income and that information will be added for you. This one is obvious, but a simple typo can hold up your tax return for weeks. Make sure you've correctly entered crucial identifying information like your Social Security number, date of birth and routing numbers if you're using direct deposit to receive your refund.""The beauty of the electronic filing is if you've got a misspelling of your name or an incorrect Social Security number, the IRS will kick that back to you pretty quickly, letting you know there's an error,"" says Adams.If your adjusted gross income is $73,000 or less, you can use IRS Free File, which gives you access to commercial tax prep software at no charge. It uses a question-and-answer format that's easy to follow, and can flag errors.Once you file your return, you can check your refund status with the ""Where's My Refund?"" online tool or through the IRS2Go app.Check out:These are the top 15 cities where college students want to live post-graduation, a new survey saysHaving a pet could help you stay sharper as you age, according to a new study — here's howSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"
2022-03-29,"Axie Infinity's Ronin Network said in a blog post Tuesday morning that it lost around $615 million in USDC (a U.S. dollar pegged stablecoin) and ethereum.That surpasses the $611 million hack of the DeFi protocol Poly Network in August 2021.The security breach was confirmed by Axie Infinity's official Discord and Twitter accounts, as well as by Ronin Network. The popular blockchain game Axie Infinity, which lets users earn money as they play, is connected to what could be the largest decentralized finance, or DeFi, hack in history.Axie Infinity's Ronin Network said in a blog post on Tuesday that it lost around $615 million in USDC (a U.S. dollar pegged stablecoin) and ethereum, surpassing the $611 million hack of the DeFi protocol Poly Network in August 2021.The security breach was confirmed by Axie Infinity's official Discord and Twitter accounts, and by Ronin Network, which underpins the game. DeFi networks aim to recreate traditional financial systems like banks, but with cryptocurrency. They mostly run on the ethereum blockchain.The incident was discovered Tuesday after a user was unable to withdraw 5,000 ether. But the attack took place on Mar. 23, when exploiters used hacked private keys to forge fake withdrawals, the blog post said, adding that other key validator nodes were compromised.Ronin said the breach resulted in 173,600 ethereum and 25.5 million USDC being drained from the Ronin bridge in two transactions, which can be viewed on Etherscan. The project lost around $615 million at current prices.Crypto holders often do not operate exclusively within one blockchain ecosystem, so developers have built cross-chain bridges to let users send cryptocurrency from one chain to another. In this case, the Ronin bridge connects Axie Infinity to other blockchains such as ethereum.Using the bridge, players could deposit ethereum or USDC to Ronin and use that to purchase non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or in-game currency. They could then sell their in-game assets and withdraw the money.Analysts at Blockchain Intelligence Group said the stolen money is on the move. Thus far, close to $17 million in ethereum has already been transferred to exchanges, including FTX and Huobi, the firm said. ""Bridges are very hard to get right and the attack surface is significantly greater than in normal DeFi projects,"" said Adrian Hetman of Immunefi, a bug bounty and security services platform for the web3 industry, in an email. Hetman said bridges are ""still an area of development"" and the industry hasn't yet established best practices for their use. Vitalik Buterin, the creator of ethereum, previously made the case that bridges won't be around much longer in crypto, in part because there are ""fundamental limits to the security of bridges that hop across multiple 'zones of sovereignty.'""Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based game that lets users collect and breed digital creatures called ""Axies."" In contrast to traditional pay-to-play games, Axie Infinity also allows players to earn money by selling their Axie NFTs to other users.Axie Infinity creator Sky Mavis said it's committed to ensuring that all of the drained funds are recovered or reimbursed. For now, users are unable to withdraw or deposit funds.  Ronin said it's ""working with law enforcement officials, forensic cryptographers, and our investors to make sure there is no loss of user funds.""WATCH: Crypto shows signs of decoupling from stocks in latest rally"

His comments come shortly after the G-7 major economies pledged to ensure the Russian state, elites, proxies and oligarchs would not be able to leverage digital assets to sidestep the impact of international sanctions.The G-7 group is comprised of the U.K., U.S., Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy.Digital currencies have proven useful in boosting Ukraine's defenses, with the government raising millions of dollars in crypto donations from the public.

2022-03-30,"A select few firms, including Revolut and Copper, will be allowed to continue trading after a temporary register closes Friday, the FCA said. The temporary register has shrunk considerably in recent weeks, with B2C2 and Wirex among those withdrawing their applications.The deadline extension comes as British officials are set to announce a new regulatory regime for crypto as soon as next week. The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority said Wednesday it is giving some crypto companies more time to register with the regulator beyond an original Mar. 31 deadline.A select few firms, including the fintech company Revolut and crypto start-up Copper, will be allowed to continue trading after a temporary registration regime closes, the FCA said in an update on its website.Copper counts the former U.K. finance minister, Philip Hammond, as an advisor.The temporary register closes on Friday ""for all but for a small number of firms where it is strictly necessary to continue to have temporary registration,"" the FCA said.""This is necessary where a firm may be pursuing an appeal or may have particular winding-down circumstances.""Crypto firms operating in the U.K. are required to be registered with the FCA under money laundering regulations. But several companies have yet to make the cut. The FCA set up a temporary register to allow firms to continue trading while they sought full authorization.The list of firms on the temporary register has shrunk considerably in recent weeks, with market maker B2C2 and trading app Wirex among the firms withdrawing their applications.B2C2 is shifting its spot trading operations to a U.S. entity, while Wirex plans to offer crypto services to Brits from a Croatian subsidiary.

A Massachusetts judge on Wednesday dealt state securities regulators a major setback in their enforcement action against online brokerage Robinhood by declaring the state's new fiduciary duty rule that underlies the case invalid.Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Michael Ricciuti in Boston concluded that Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin lacked the authority to adopt a rule in March 2020 that raised the investment-advice standard for brokers.Galvin in December 2020 accused the app-based service of using strategies that treated trading like a game to lure young, inexperienced customers, including by having confetti rain down on the user's screen for each trade made on its app.Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, through an administrative case, has sought to revoke Robinhood's broker-dealer license in the state. Parts of the case were based on alleged violations of the fiduciary duty rule.That rule went beyond a standard the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted in 2019 by requiring broker-dealers have a fiduciary obligation to provide investment without regard to the interests of anyone but their customers.But Ricciuti said the rule overrode state law and that nothing in the state's securities statute suggests the legislature intended to give Galvin the authority to do so through rule making.He put his decision on hold to allow Galvin, a Democrat, time to pursue an appeal. A spokesperson for Galvin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Dan Gallagher, Robinhood's chief legal office, in a statement welcomed the ruling, saying Galvin has ""consistently mischaracterized and disparaged Robinhood's platform and customers without any legal basis."""

One in five Americans has invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, a new NBC News poll found, another sign that digital assets continue to get more popular even as lawmakers warn of market risks and work to regulate the industry.Half of men between the ages of 18 and 49 said they have dabbled in crypto, the highest share of all demographic groups.Forty percent of Black Americans said they have traded or used crypto, while 42% all people between the ages of 18 and 34 years said the same.The fact that 21% of the 1,000 Americans polled said they have at least once used or invested in crypto shows how much the relatively young industry has taken off in recent years.

2022-03-31,"The April 18 tax deadline is just weeks away, and for many Americans it will be the first time they answer questions about cryptocurrencies on their tax returns.Crypto traders and NFT buyers and sellers will need to report their gains to the Internal Revenue Service so that they can be properly taxed. But it can be confusing to know if you owe taxes on your bitcoin, dogecoin, ether and other currencies, especially with the tricky cryptocurrency question that's included on every tax return.For the second straight year, the first item taxpayers will encounter on their 1040 forms after filling out their contact information is a question asking if ""at any time during 2021, did [they] receive, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in any virtual currency.""It's a question that is easy to answer if you understand what the IRS is trying to find out, says Austin Woodward, a certified public accountant and CEO of crypto accounting platform TaxBit.""If you just bought it and didn't sell anything, you can actually answer 'no' to that question because you do not have any taxable gains or losses to report,"" he says.But if you bought and sold cryptocurrency, or otherwise spent your crypto or exchanged it for other digital tokens, you must respond ""yes"" to the question.That's because under U.S. tax law, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are classified as property and subject to capital gains taxes, meaning that you owe taxes on the increase in value of your property from when you first bought it. But you only owe taxes when those gains are realized.""Any time you sell a cryptocurrency or trade it for another form of property, or if you're using it for a means of payment, you are incurring a taxable event,"" Woodward says.The amount you will owe depends on how long you held your cryptocurrency, and whether you sold or exchanged it for a profit or a loss. If you owned your crypto for under a year, the taxes you pay on any gains will be the same as your normal income tax rate.If you owned your crypto for more than a year, you will pay a long-term capital gains tax rate, which is determined by your income. For single filers, the capital gains tax rate is 0% if you earn up to $40,400 per year, 15% if you earn up to $445,850 and 20% if you make more than that. This IRS worksheet can help you do the math.Investors who sold or exchanged their crypto at a loss — for example, buying bitcoin at $60,000 and selling it at $30,000 — can use their losses to lower their taxable income by a maximum of $3,000. Any additional losses can be carried over to future years.Woodward encourages anyone who has incurred losses to be proactive about reporting them to the IRS, no matter how small. Failing to do so, he warns, could result in an IRS audit.""They have a lot of infrastructure and teams in place to go after known cryptocurrency users that don't report,"" he says. ""There might be some costs associated with navigating an audit that you would otherwise not want to go through if you had just reported your losses.""Whatever you do, make sure you don't fail to report any crypto transactions to the IRS, Woodward says. Tax returns are signed under the penalty of perjury, and it is possible that you can be caught lying to the IRS.""I think one of the misconceptions of crypto is that it's anonymous and there's not a record of who's using it and what's happening,"" he says. ""You should report under the assumption that the IRS knows about it anyway.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Get your tax refund faster by avoiding these 6 commonly overlooked mistakes"
2022-03-31,"Both resignations and job openings were near record highs in February, and the layoff rate was near a historic low.Employer demand for workers remains high and is fueling the trend known as the Great Resignation.However, demand may cool in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and if the war in Ukraine weighs on the U.S. economy. The pandemic-era trend known as the ""Great Resignation"" remains a prominent feature of the labor market, as favorable conditions lead workers to quit their jobs at near-record levels in search of better (and ample) opportunities elsewhere.Nearly 4.4 million Americans quit their jobs in February, the U.S. Department of Labor said Tuesday.That's about 100,000 more people than quit in January, and just shy of the 4.5 million record set in November. ""These quits are still extremely high, and that shows the Great Resignation is still in full swing,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at the career site Glassdoor.The high demand for workers shows little sign of abating but may have plateaued, he added.""It wouldn't be a surprise to see that cool down in 2022,"" Zhao said. ""But that's not to say we should expect the Great Resignation to disappear overnight."" Resignations, or ""quits"" — which are generally voluntary separations initiated by workers — serve as a measure of employees' willingness or ability to leave jobs, according to the Labor Department.Job openings, like resignations, have also lingered near record highs, helping fuel workers' confidence in finding new gigs elsewhere.There were 11.3 million job openings in February — essentially unchanged from January and down slightly from December's record of more than 11.4 million.Job openings reflect employer demand for workers and tend to move up and down with resignations, Zhao said.The layoff rate — a measure of layoffs relative to the overall level of employment — also remains near historic lows, at 0.9% in February.

It hadn't previously touched 1% since record keeping started in 2000.Meanwhile, 202,000 people filed a new claim for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That trend is below the historical average, said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.8% in February, its lowest level since February 2020. The Labor Department is issuing its March jobs report on Friday. These data points — ""quits,"" job openings, layoffs and benefits — reflect a job market that's been strong for workers.Employer demand for labor picked up steam in the spring and early summer 2021, as Covid-19 vaccines started rolling out broadly in the U.S. and the economy began emerging from its pandemic hibernation.That high demand has outpaced the ready supply of workers, and businesses have raised wages at their fastest clip in years to compete for talent. Others have expanded their hiring pool.  ""There is a brutal battle for lower-skilled employees occurring,"" Ron Hetrick, senior economist at Emsi Burning Glass, a job market analytics firm, said. ""Companies that usually require college degrees are starting to drop those requirements, meaning they're now entering into the fray to find the same worker that other companies have trouble hiring.""Most people who quit are switching jobs rather than leaving the labor force altogether, according to Nick Bunker, an economist at job site Indeed. The number of people hired in February exceeded resignations by about 2.3 million people, the Labor Department said. However, there are signs the Great Resignation trend may have topped out at the end of 2021. Resignations and job openings seem to be plateauing, a sign that employer demand may wane throughout 2022, Zhao said.The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, started raising its benchmark interest rate in March (which will raise borrowing costs for companies and households). The Fed is aiming to cool off the economy and rein in inflation, which is running at a 40-year high. The war in Ukraine may also have dampening effect on the economy.""It's possible that with the benefit of hindsight, we'll say December 2021 was the peak of employer demand in this cycle, before rate hikes, geopolitical uncertainty and other risk factors slowed the economy,"" Zhao said.""[But] as long as employer demand remains high, I fully expect the Great Resignation to continue,"" he added."
2022-04-01,"Major banks are building out teams dedicated to cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology.Start-ups are looking to compete for talent by offering faster-paced environments, equity and less red tape, courting talent from Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and others.""You're taking brand risk — Goldman is one of the storied institutions of Wall Street,"" said Justin Schmidt, former head of digital asset markets at Goldman Sachs. Wall Street has been beefing up hiring for digital asset teams. But some employees are walking away from name-brand institutions in search of more risk, and potentially, more reward.JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are among the firms with dedicated groups for cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. JPMorgan has one of the largest crypto teams, with more than 200 employees working in its Onyx division. The JPM Coin digital currency is being used commercially to send payments around the world.Umar Farooq, the CEO of Onyx by JPMorgan, said the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank's brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start-up. But when products are launched, they reach ""a scale that a fintech can only dream of.""""There aren't many places where you can roll out a new platform and that platform can go from literally nothing to transacting a billion dollars of trade a day in a few months,"" Farooq told CNBC. ""That sort of scale can only be possible when you operate at a company like JPMorgan Chase. The upside of that scale is way more important than whatever downsides might exist by virtue of more regulations or controls.""When it comes to hiring, Farooq said it's a mix of current JPMorgan employees and competing for talent with start-ups and bigger tech companies. From first-year analysts to senior management and managing directors, there's a greater interest in making the move to crypto, he said. Financial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015, according to recent data from LinkedIn. In the first half of 2021, that pace jumped by 40%. Banks on a crypto hiring spree included Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Capital One, Barclays, Credit Suisse, UBS, Bank of America and BNY Mellon.The crypto boom on Wall Street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start-up world. Crypto and blockchain companies raised a record $25 billion last year, an eightfold increase from a year earlier, according to CB Insights data.Farooq said that even with the start-up boom, JPMorgan has seen ""limited attrition."" Those leaving have been people ""wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar.""However, JPMorgan did lose one of its highest-profile crypto deputies last year. Christine Moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at Onyx. She has yet to announce her next move.""After over a half-decade laying the foundations for blockchain-based infrastructure across financial markets and cross-border payments, creating new businesses that have already scaled into the $USD billions at J.P. Morgan, I am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the Web3/crypto ecosystem from a new angle,"" Moy told CNBC in an email. Other top crypto executives who left Wall Street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution.Mary Catherine Lader, chief operating officer at Uniswap Labs, left her job as a managing director at BlackRock last year. Her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company.""It certainly wasn't my primary job,"" Lader said. ""It was kind of a hobby, as it is for so many people on Wall Street, and it definitely wasn't something that at the time I was thinking about, because it was early stages of adoption."" At Uniswap, Lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. She said she couldn't pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation.""This technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn't feel like a risk at all,"" Lader said. ""I was sad to leave the people I had loved working with for many years. I have tremendous respect for the firm, but it didn't feel like a risk. That's a great thing about where we are in Web3.""Justin Schmidt, former head of digital asset markets at Goldman Sachs, made a similar career change last year. He joined institutional crypto trading platform Talos and described the risk in a similar way, calling the decision ""multidimensional.""""Inherently, you're taking a brand risk — Goldman is one of the storied institutions of Wall Street,"" Schmidt said. ""You are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional, and I very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there's a generational opportunity here.""Cryptocurrency start-ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent. Many are looking beyond top candidates with MBAs, and instead considering those with less conventional resumes. Lader and Schmidt said some of their best crypto hires have been self-taught engineers or crypto influencers they first interacted with on Twitter.""I constantly am meeting people who are 23 years old, who are as smart about markets as people I worked with on Wall Street for years,"" Lader said. ""People who frankly had no interest in financial services, who would never really explore or consider working on Wall Street, are excited to work at UniSwap Labs and companies like us."""
2022-04-01,"To achieve financial success, knowledge is key.Yet many Americans lack financial literacy. That can impact everything from the amount of money saved to debt owed.The situation is dire for more than a few. More than half of Americans can't cover a $1,000 emergency expense with savings, a January survey from Bankrate found. Meanwhile, about 20% of employees run out of money before their next paycheck, according to Salary Finance. That's up from 15% last year.Meanwhile, U.S. adults correctly answered only 50% of the questions on the TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index in 2021, a noted measure of financial literacy. That's 2 percentage points lower than the previous year.More from Invest in You:Florida mandates personal finance education in high schoolHow to raise financially healthy kids and mistakes to avoidCollege Money 101: From student loans to setting up a budget""Financial literacy can help Americans feel confident about the decisions they make on a daily basis,"" said NFL linebacker Brandon Copeland, who teaches a personal finance class at his alma mater, University of Pennsylvania.""To expect success in anything I do, I must first understand the rules and guidelines of that game,"" he added. ""The same applies to understanding money and how it operates."" These days, Americans are still grappling with the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing inflation, which is costing the average U.S. household an additional $296 per month, a Moody's Analytics analysis found.Yet there is always going to be something that may disrupt your life, said Nan Morrison, president and CEO of the Council for Economic Education.""There are a lot of things that may impact your income or the world around us, but making a decision in the moment isn't actually going to be that helpful,"" she said. ""Having built the good habits that you need early in life.... will help to get through all those changes.""Those behaviors include understanding where you stand financially, building a budget and saving for emergencies. Knowledge is also power when it comes to investing. While trading meme stocks and cryptocurrency has become popular, it's important to remember that saving for the long-term is vital to your financial health, said certified financial planner Cathy Curtis, founder and CEO of Curtis Financial Planning in Oakland, California.It was something she recently counseled her new hairdresser on, after he confided his anxiety around money and concern about providing financial stability for his family. The stylist, in his mid-40s, was invested in a fintech company stock and in crypto through a popular trading app, but had no retirement savings or life insurance.""If my hairstylist knew the basics about Roth [individual retirement accounts], for example, starting many years ago, he would be so far ahead,"" Curtis said.""Without basic financial education about the power of compounding interest, what types of savings accounts and retirement accounts are available, and how important it is to start saving early, the financial future of many Americans is grim."" Couples may have different thoughts about money. When there is mismanagement of finances or a difference of opinion about how to use money, that can create conflicts.""Many couples struggle to talk about money and if there is a lack of financial literacy in the couple, there could be many financial missteps,"" said licensed marriage and family therapist Dr. George James, chief innovation officer and senior staff therapist at the non-profit Council for Relationships.""Having a greater understanding of financial literacy can help relationships to build a future and be on the same page,"" he added. ""It can also reduce the amount of conflict."" Advocates believe its important to start learning good financial habits at a young age, and there's no better place than in school.Twenty-five states require high-school students to take personal finance coursework, either in a standalone class or integrated into another course, according to the Council for Economic Education. Last week, Florida became the latest to sign a bill into law mandating a course for graduation.In addition, there are 46 personal finance bills currently pending in 21 states, according to Next Gen Personal Finance's bill tracker.The impact of that education can be seen in several studies, advocates argue. It has been shown to reduce the likelihood of using payday loans among young adults and is positively correlated with asset accumulation by age 25. Another study that compared three states that mandated personal finance coursework to three states that didn't found that credit outcomes improved in the mandate states. Three years after education was implemented in Georgia, Idaho and Texas, all three states saw a reduction in severe delinquency rates and credit scores rise.""Schools are the great equalizer,"" said Yanely Espinal, director of educational outreach at Next Gen Personal Finance.""This is the opportunity for us to create access for all students regardless of their zip code, regardless of their parents' knowledge level or income level, regardless of whether their families know this information or not.""SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

2022-04-02,"Alex Iskold, a tech entrepreneur and start-up investor, revived the 1K Project to provide direct relief to Ukrainian families impacted by the war.The project has raised more than $3.5 million and helped 3,500 Ukrainian families in less than a month.With more than 70,000 families already waiting for support and more applications coming in by the hour, the project needs more individual and corporate sponsors. A little over a month into Russia's assault on Ukraine, Alex Iskold is trying to reckon with the reality in his homeland while lending a hand the best way he knows how.Iskold, who immigrated to the U.S. from Ukraine at age 19, is a venture capitalist and managing director of 2048 Ventures in New York. He's also a tech entrepreneur and co-founder of the 1K Project, a nonprofit that allows anyone to donate $1,000 directly to a Ukrainian family.So far, the project has raised more than $3.5 million and helped 3,500 families. But Iskold, now 49, knows the crisis ahead for Ukraine, a country of 44 million people, is poised to deepen no matter when the fighting ends.More than 4 million Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries, with more than half entering Poland, as the Russian military has pounded population centers. Millions more are certain to lack basic necessities far into the future, and will need money for food, medicine, clothing and transportation.""There's a lot of ways you can donate, but when you donate direct relief, you know one family is better off because you helped them,"" Iskold said in an interview.For a family of three to four, $1,000 lasts only about a month, he said. With more than 70,000 families already waiting for support and more applications coming in by the hour, the project needs individual and corporate sponsors to keep contributing.""This is a strong call to action, because companies could make a significant difference, and we're confident we're the right vessel for delivering the aid,"" he said. ""Hopefully companies can step up and help us get to more families.""The concept behind the 1K Project is simple: An individual donates $1,000, which gets sent directly to a Ukrainian family. Iskold launched the 1K Project for a different purpose. He and Chrysi Philalithes, a fellow entrepreneur and start-up investor, created it in 2020 to assist Ukrainian families during the Covid-19 pandemic. Iskold revived it when Russia invaded Ukraine.""For me, the 1K Project is an outlet, a coping mechanism,"" said Iskold, who left Ukraine in the early 1990s to escape antisemitic persecution. ""I could be sitting on the couch watching television for hours, or I could help in a different way.""The 1K Project team consists of more than 50 volunteers, many working 10 hours a week, from across the U.S. as well as in Latvia, Ukraine, France and Kazakhstan. The operations team, responsible for reviewing family applications and responding to sponsors, includes some high school students and Iskold's own children. Engineers come from such companies as Techstars, Yahoo, Mozilla, Venmo and Citigroup. ""We have the best engineering talent I've ever seen,"" Iskold said. ""They're moving at the speed of light.""The group needs it because ""the engineering challenge is immense,"" Iskold said, adding that his experience with distributed systems helped him to build out the technology. The team, meanwhile, collaborates using software such as AirTable, Slack, Notion and Front.""It's just this incredible combination of code and people we use to get the job done,"" he said.To apply for aid, families fill out a single form. They need a bank card that accepts the local currency in order to receive aid. Of the applicants, roughly 40% are still in their hometown in Ukraine, 20% are refugees outside the country and 40% are displaced.Once a volunteer reviews an application, that information gets passed to a sponsor, who then sends the money through Wise, a multicurrency money transfer service. The money is directly deposited into the family's bank account so the funds are accessible even if they're on the move.  ""We willed the system into existence and constantly wrote code as we are funding families,"" Iskold said. ""We are close to 100% automated wherever possible, including checking of applications for basic errors. Still, support emails and SMS for families and sponsors keep us busy."" Cryptocurrencies can also be donated. When that happens, they're sold for cash, which is sent to the families using Wise and converted into the Ukrainian currency, hryvnia. A partner organization called Open Collective accepts donations over $1,000, whether through cash, stocks or cryptocurrency.People have taken advantage of the crypto option in creative ways, Iskold said. Meta Angels, a community of people working on digital art in the form of non-fungible tokens, created a set of unique NFTs and sold close to $50,000 worth for the 1K Project.Iskold said there's widespread sense of responsibility that people feel toward helping Ukrainians. Many are watching the war unfold and seeking ways to help.Ukrainian officials have pushed for a cease-fire agreement and a resolution to the humanitarian crisis sparked by the Kremlin's invasion. At peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, Russia claimed it would reduce its attacks on Ukraine, but military forces have continued to carry out strikes around the capital city, Kyiv.Iskold's efforts can't keep up with the devastation, but for some families it may be all they have.""The 1K Project is a bridge until affected families can get back on their feet,"" he said. WATCH: Russia claims reduction in military action near Kyiv"
2022-04-02," The average fixed rate on a traditional 30-year mortgage is 4.67%, up from below 3% in November and the highest it's been since late 2018.By comparison, the initial rate on a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage is 3.5%.While an ARM can make sense for some homebuyers, it's worth assessing whether it works best for your situation. As interest rates tick upward, it may be tempting for homebuyers to explore adjustable rate mortgages.The appeal of an ARM, as it's called, can be the lower initial interest rate compared with a traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. However, that rate can change down the road — and not necessarily in your favor.""There is a lot of variability in the specific terms as to how much the rates can go up and how quickly,"" said certified financial planner David Mendels, director of planning at Creative Financial Concepts in New York. ""No one can predict what rates will do, but one thing is clear — there is a whole lot more room on the upside than there is on the downside.""

Here's whyDemand may push advisors to turn to cryptocurrencies Interest rates remain low from a historical perspective but have been rising amid a housing market that already is posing affordability challenges for buyers. The median list price of a home in the U.S. is $405,000, up 14% from a year ago, according to Realtor.com.The average fixed rate on a 30-year mortgage is 4.67%, up from below 3% in November and the highest it's been since late 2018, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. By comparison, the average introductory rate on one popular ARM is at 3.5%.With these mortgages, the initial interest rate is fixed for a set amount of time.   After that, the rate could go up or down, or remain unchanged. That uncertainty makes an ARM a riskier proposition than a fixed-rate mortgage. This holds true whether you use an ARM to purchase a home or to refinance a loan on a home you already own.If you're exploring an ARM, there are a few things to know.For starters, consider the name of the ARM. For a so-called 5/1 ARM, for instance, the introductory rate lasts five years (the ""5"") and after that the rate can change once a year (the ""1″). Some lenders also offer ARMs with the introductory rate lasting three years (a 3/1 ARM), seven years (a 7/1 ARM) and 10 years (a 10/1 ARM).Aside from knowing when the interest rate could begin to change and how often, you need to know how much that adjustment could be and what the maximum rate charged could be.""Don't just think in terms of a 1% or 2% increase,"" Mendels said. ""Could you cope with a maximum increase?""Mortgage lenders employ an index and add an agreed-upon percentage point (called the margin) to arrive at the total rate you pay. Commonly used benchmarks include the one-year Libor, which stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate, or the weekly yield on the one-year Treasury bill. So if the index used by the lender is at 1% and your margin is 2.75%, you'll pay 3.75%. After five years with a 5/1 ARM, if the index is at, say, 2%, your total would be 4.75%. But if the index is at, say, 5% after five years? Whether your interest rate could jump that much depends on the terms of your contract.An ARM generally comes with caps on the annual adjustment and over the life of the loan. However, they can vary among lenders, which makes it important to fully understand the terms of your loan.Initial adjustment cap. This cap says how much the interest rate can increase the first time it adjusts after the fixed-rate period expires. It's common for this cap to be 2% — meaning that at the first rate change, the new rate can't be more than 2 percentage points higher than the initial rate during the fixed-rate period.Subsequent adjustment cap. This clause shows how much the interest rate can increase in the adjustment periods that follow. This number is commonly 2%, meaning that the new rate can't be more than 2 percentage points higher than the previous rate.Lifetime adjustment cap. This term means how much the interest rate can increase in total over the life of the loan. This cap is often 5%, meaning that the rate can never be 5 percentage points higher than the initial rate. However, some lenders may have a higher cap.An ARM may make sense for buyers who anticipate moving before the initial rate period expires. However, because life happens and it's impossible to predict future economic conditions, it's wise to consider the possibility that you won't be able to move or sell. ""I'd also be concerned if you do an ARM with a low down payment,"" said Stephen Rinaldi, president and founder of Rinaldi Group, a mortgage broker. ""If the market corrects for whatever reason and home values drop, you could be underwater on the house and unable to get out of the ARM.""Rinaldi said ARMs tend to make the most sense for more expensive homes because the amount saved with the initial rate can be thousands of dollars a year.""The difference between 3.5% and 5% can be $400 a month,"" Rinaldi said. ""On a 7/1 ARM that could mean saving $5,000 a year or $35,000 altogether, so I can see the logic in that.""For a mortgage under about $200,000, the savings are less and may not be worth choosing an ARM over a fixed rate, he said.""I don't think it's worth the risk to save $100 or so a month,"" Rinaldi said."
2022-04-02,"Human trafficking generates about $150 billion a year globally in illegal profits, according to the International Labour Organization, and poses a complicated challenge for major hotel chains. In 2020 there were more than 10,000 reported cases of human trafficking in the U.S., with 72% of those related to sex trafficking, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. Hotels and motels are among the most common venues for sex trafficking due to easy access, willingness to accept cash, and lack of facility maintenance.The Covid-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the issue, as criminals abuse new hotel technology like contactless check-in, which makes it more difficult to spot signs of trafficking. Meanwhile, sex trafficking lawsuits continue to pile up against hotel chains.A law passed in 2000 to criminalize trafficking penalizes private entities that enable or are complicit with the illegal act. Since then, major hotel brands as well as smaller motels have been sued for negligence, profiting from and promoting sex trafficking.Hotels such as Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt have implemented their own human trafficking training requirements for employees. Hotel staff are asked to look for warnings signs including paying with cash, toting few personal items and refusing cleaning service for multiple days. Most hotels and motels agree they have a responsibility to detect, monitor and report potential trafficking. Watch the video to learn more."
2022-04-03,"DUBAI – ""Are we ready for the new world order?""The provocative title of the panel that lead off the ambitiously named World Government Summit here last week was framed to suggest that a new global order is emerging — and the world is not ready for it.There has been a proliferation of writing about who will shape the future world order since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the most murderous Europe has suffered since 1939.The tempting conclusion: Should Ukraine survive as an independent, sovereign, and democratic country, the U.S.- and Europe-backed forces will regain momentum against the previously ascendant Russian-Chinese forces of authoritarianism, oppression and (at least in Putin's case) evil. That sounds like good news, but there is a downside.""The Russian invasion of Ukraine and a series of COVID-related shutdowns in China do not, on the surface, appear to have much in common,"" writes Atlantic Council fellow Michael Schuman in The Atlantic (a publication not related to the Council). ""Yet both are accelerating a shift that is taking the world in a dangerous direction, splitting it into two spheres, one centered on Washington, D.C., the other on Beijing.""My conversations in Dubai — at the World Government Summit and at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Forum — show little enthusiasm or conviction for this bifurcated vision of the future. The Middle Eastern participants have no interest in abandoning relations with China, the leading trading partner for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, or breaking with Russia, which established itself as a force to be reckoned with when it saved Syrian President Bashar al-Assad through its military intervention in his war.Beyond that, our Mideast partners have lost confidence in America's commitment to global leadership or competence for it following last year's botched Afghanistan withdrawal. They are also experiencing whiplash from a Trump administration that trashed the nuclear deal with Iran to a Biden administration they feel is pursuing it without sufficiently factoring in Tehran's regional aggression.  In all my many travels to the Mideast over the years, I have never heard this level of frustration from Mideast government officials with American policymakers.That said, they are watching Ukraine with fascination, because a Ukrainian victory — with a strong, united West behind it — would force a rethink about U.S. commitment and competence and shift the trajectory of declining transatlantic influence and relevance. Conversely, a Putin victory — even at a huge cost to Russians and Ukrainians alike — would accelerate Western decline as an effective global actor.My own answer to the panel question on our preparedness for ""the new world order"" was to quote Henry Kissinger (who else?) in questioning the premise. ""No truly 'global' world order' has ever existed,"" Kissinger wrote in his book ""World Order."" ""What passes for order in our time was devised in Western Europe nearly four centuries ago, at a peace conference in the German region of Westphalia, conducted without the involvement or even the awareness of most other continents or civilizations."" Over the following centuries, its influence spread.With that as context, the question is not what the new world order would be, but rather if the U.S. and its allies can through Ukraine reverse the erosion of the past century's gains as a first step toward establishing the first truly ""global"" world order.Former U.S. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley tells me the effort was the fourth attempt toward international order in the past century.The first effort after World War I, through the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations, tragically failed. Instead, the world got European fascism, U.S. isolationism, a global economic crisis, and millions dead from the Holocaust and World War II.Following World War II, the U.S. and its partners were dramatically more successful, building what came to be called ""the liberal international order,"" through the Marshall Plan and new multilateral institutions like the United Nations, the World Bank and IMF, NATO, the European Union, and others.The third effort came following the West's Cold War triumph. European democracies emerged or were restored, NATO was enlarged, the European Union expanded, and it seemed for a time that the rules, practices, and institutions developed in the West after World War II and during the Cold War period could absorb and steer an expanded international order. China profited from and embraced this order for a time.What has been eroding now for some years is U.S. leaders' commitment to defend, uphold and advance that expanded international order — what Kissinger called ""an inexorably expanding cooperative order of states observing common rules and norms, embracing liberal economic systems, forswearing territorial conquest, respecting national sovereignty, and adopting participatory and democratic systems of government.""      American foreign policy leadership has rarely been consistent, but it was remarkably so after World War II and through the end of the Cold War. Since then, the inconsistencies have grown, underscored by former President Barack Obama's ""leading from behind"" and former President Donald Trump's ""America First.""Both, in their own ways, were a retreat from former President Harry Truman, and the post-World War II architecture and U.S. global leadership he established and embraced.In the Middle East, countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE that were once our closest allies now are hedging their bets. Beyond the Iran disagreements, the failure of former President Trump to accept his own electoral defeat raises doubts among our friends about the durability of the American political system and the consistency of U.S. foreign policy.Beyond that, our Mideast friends resent the Biden administration's characterization of the emerging global contest as one pitting democracy versus authoritarianism.""Every democratic attempt in the Arab world has turned ideological or tribal, so I'm not sure it is something we can work out successfully,"" Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE President, told the World Government Summit. He sees the issues between democracy and authoritarianism as not binary, but ones of governance and the solution being ""something in the middle of both.""   President Joe Biden's decision to release on Thursday an ""unprecedented"" 180 million barrels of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve was an acknowledgment that America's traditional oil-producing partners were not prepared to help him. The decision came hours after OPEC ignored calls from western politicians to pump oil more quickly – and to resist any suggestion they should remove Russia from the organization.Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited New Delhi this week to thank India for its refusal to join sanctions against Russia, an approach shared by Brazil, Mexico, Israel, and the UAE.  Said Lavrov, ""We will be ready to supply to India any goods which India wants to buy.""To shape the future world order, the U.S. and Europe first need to reverse the trajectory of Western and democratic decline in Ukraine.The rest will need to follow.—Frederick Kempe is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Atlantic Council."
2022-04-03,"On the drought-stricken land where Pinal County farmers have irrigated crops for thousands of years, Nancy Caywood stopped her pickup truck along an empty canal and pointed to a field of dead alfalfa.""It's heart wrenching,"" said Caywood, a third-generation farmer who manages 247 acres an hour outside of Phoenix.An intensifying drought and declining reservoir levels across the Western U.S. prompted the first-ever cuts to Arizona farmers' water supply from the Colorado River. CASA GRANDE, Ariz. — On the drought-stricken land where Pinal County farmers have irrigated crops for thousands of years, Nancy Caywood stopped her pickup truck along an empty canal and pointed to a field of dead alfalfa.""It's heart wrenching,"" said Caywood, a third-generation farmer who manages 247 acres of property an hour outside of Phoenix. ""My mom and dad toiled the land for so many years, and now we might have to give it up.""Farming in the desert has always been a challenge for Arizona's farmers, who grow water-intensive crops like cotton, alfalfa and corn for cows. But this year is different. An intensifying drought and declining reservoir levels across the Western U.S. prompted the first-ever cuts to their water supply from the Colorado River.The canals that would normally bring water from an eastern Arizona reservoir to Caywood's family farm have mostly dried up. The farm will soon be operating at less than half of its usual production. And Caywood is grappling with a recent 33% price hike for water she's not receiving.""We're not making one dime off this farm right now,"" Caywood said. ""But we're trying to hang on because this is what we love.""More than 40 million people in the West rely on the Colorado River, which flows along Arizona's western edge. The farmers hit the hardest this year are in Pinal County, a rural stretch of land where agriculture is receding and slowly getting replaced by solar panels and housing developments. Driving through Casa Grande, a city of 55,000 people that's about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson, you'll see miles of unplanted land, dead cotton fields and dry canals.Farmers here fear additional water restrictions in the coming weeks as a warming climate continues to reduce the amount of water that typically fills the Colorado River from rainfall and melting snow.The Bureau of Reclamation in August declared a water shortage at Lake Mead, one of the river's primary reservoirs, after water levels fell to historic lows. More than one-third of Arizona's water flows up the Colorado River to Lake Mead.The government's declaration triggered Tier 1 water reductions, which slashed the state's river water supply by nearly 20%, or 512,000 acre-feet. One acre-foot of water supplies about two households each year.Arizona farmers use nearly three-quarters of the available water supply to irrigate their crops. As supply runs low, some farmers in Pinal County couldn't afford to operate any longer and sold their land to solar developers. Others have left fields empty to cut down on water use, or have experimented with drought-resistant plants. Then there are those who started pumping more groundwater, which raises additional concerns since Arizona's groundwater supplies are already overused.When Caywood's grandfather signed the land in 1930, he was drawn in by cheap prices and technological developments that allowed for water to be transported from canals connected to the San Carlos reservoir more than 100 miles away.Last year, the San Carlos reservoir plummeted to zero acre-feet.""There's always a chance of rainwater, or some snow in the East,"" Caywood said. ""We have to have hope. Or we throw our hands up and say, 'We're done.'"" Arizona's climate doesn't have enough rain to grow most crops. Still, for thousands of years, the rivers and aquifers that hold groundwater have supported the state's now $23 billion agriculture industry.Climate change and dwindling water supplies have wreaked havoc on the once prosperous farms that could endure the arid conditions. The U.S. West is now experiencing a megadrought that's generated the two driest decades in the region in at least 1,200 years. Scientists say 42% of the drought's severity can be attributed to human-caused climate change, and warn that conditions could persist for years.The consequences are far-reaching. A prolonged drought will not just reduce local farm income in Arizona, but create tighter supply and increased food prices for consumers across the country.Despite the brutal conditions, Caywood wants to continue the farming legacy of her parents, both of whom died last year. In an attempt to salvage her property, Nancy frequently conducts farm tours to educate people about the water crisis. Her son, Travis Hartman, has leased plots in other irrigation districts that currently have access to Colorado River water. Caywood continues to plant as much as possible, but watches with unease as neighboring farmland is converted into solar panel developments. She estimates that her farm could shutter in three years as expenses mount and property taxes remain.""You got costs for leveling the land, pairing the fields, buying seed, fertilizing — everything that goes into the crop,"" Caywood said. ""Then, the question is, can we pay for the water and taxes? Probably not. Will we make ends meet? We don't know. It's very stressful.""One major concern is whether the Tier 1 water restrictions are enough to sustain reservoir levels as less water flows into the river. Reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin dropped to their lowest levels on record last year following 22 consecutive years of drought. In just five years, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the river's two largest reservoirs, have lost 50% of their capacity.Bradley Udall, a water and climate scientist at Colorado State University's Colorado Water Institute, is not shocked by the drop. After all, he said, scientists have been warning about declining reservoir levels in the West for at least four decades.""The drop in reservoir contents is stunning, but it feels inevitable that we reached this point,"" Udall said. ""It's super uncomfortable to say, 'We told you so,' but man — there's been a lot of science about this problem for a long time."" A half-hour away from the Caywood property, fourth-generation farmer Will Thelander is operating part of his family's 6,000 acres in Pinal County.Thelander, who farms crops like corn, wheat, and alfalfa, lost half his water supply this year and is fallowing nearly half the land. He's stopped growing cotton, a particularly water-intensive crop, and has instead focused on crops that are less demanding. He doesn't expect the water shortage problem to improve, and warns that farmers will only be able to pump groundwater for so long until it runs out entirely.Anticipating more water cuts, Thelander has placed all his hope in guayule, a drought-tolerant plant that can be harvested and used in rubber production. His farm, Tempe Farming Co., is participating in research for the tire company Bridgestone, which helped Thelander plant 25 acres of the crop in 2019.Guayule uses half as much water as alfalfa and is harvested every two years. At a larger scale, it could conserve a lot of water. According to preliminary estimates, converting roughly 100,000 acres to guayule production in the area may conserve 150,000 acre-feet of water each year, representing 15% of Pinal County's agricultural water consumption.""There's no way to make more water,"" Thelander said. ""The only thing farmers can do is pivot, try new crops — do whatever they can.""""But not a lot of things like the desert,"" he added. Thelander's farm experienced a 20% revenue loss this year, a smaller number than expected due to skyrocketing prices of supplies such as hay. While hopeful about guayule, which could potentially make up for his farm's revenue loss by 2026, Thelander is skeptical about the future of farming in Arizona.""I tell people who want to farm to pick a different career,"" he said. ""I hope everyone here can make it. But it's just not going to happen.""Arizona has turned to several options to access other water sources. The state is looking to import groundwater to Phoenix and Tucson from various parts of the state, and lease more water from Indian tribes with higher priority water rights.Another state proposal involves producing fresh water by desalinating water from the Sea of Cortez, located roughly 50 miles across Mexico from Arizona's southern border. Some critics have condemned that plan as evading the need for water conservation.Meanwhile, water leaders in Arizona, Nevada and California signed an agreement in December to slash their usage of Colorado River water in hopes to delay more cuts in the upcoming years. The plan, which is still being negotiated, requires states to cut 500,000 acre-feet in 2022 and 2023 and help fund water conservation projects. Phoenix, one of the hottest and driest regions of the country, draws a large amount of its water from the Colorado River. The city is set to voluntarily lose some river water under that plan.Cynthia Campbell, Phoenix's water resource management adviser, said the department is discussing issues ""we've never had to contemplate before"" as reservoir levels decline.""The American West is a canary in the coal mine for climate change,"" Campbell said, in a meeting at Phoenix City Hall. ""These problems will start happening in other places too.""For Caywood, a major hope is that new infrastructure funding will go to updating aging wells and canals on her property.President Joe Biden in November signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that includes several billion dollars that could help Arizona farmers cope with the water crisis. The legislation has funding for western water projects that would improve infrastructure like watersheds and underground aquifers.""We need to protect American farms. If we don't, we'll find ourselves cut off from food supply,"" Caywood said. ""We all need water and we all need food. That's why we're fighting to stay in the game."""
2022-04-03,"""Resilience"" has emerged as one of the most popular buzzwords since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, a catch-all for coping with the turbulence of the past two years. It appears in headlines applauding front-line workers pulling double shifts and presidential speeches rallying people to steel themselves for future crises. But what does it mean to be truly resilient? ""People need to understand that being resilient means you are experiencing something at a high stress level, and we are not meant to function at such a level for an extended period of time,"" Dr. Jessica Jackson, a psychologist and global clinical diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging manager at Modern Health, tells CNBC Make It. She continues: ""When we think about building resiliency, we have to acknowledge that resiliency doesn't always mean being hard – resilience can also be rest, it can be vulnerability and processing emotions, so it's easier to navigate a stressful situation."" There are a few habits you can adopt to build your mental strength and resilience. Here are four recommendations from Dr. Jackson and psychiatrist Dr. Samantha Boardman. We're quick to ask others ""How are you?"" – but when's the last time you asked yourself the same question? It's easy to block out emotions and operate on autopilot until you're on the verge of burning out. ""Think about a car: You might not notice the oil leaking because it's always moving, but when it's parked for a while, and you move it, suddenly you realize there's a puddle of oil underneath,"" Jackson says. ""It's the same thing with our mental health.""Set a timer for five minutes each morning and take note of how you're feeling. Dr. Jackson suggests starting with the following questions: How do I feel?What do I need today?How do I want today to go?Sitting in silence and thinking through these questions can help you process negative emotions and figure out any adjustments you need to make in your schedule to stave off stress, whether it's going for a run, ordering takeout or a different self-care activity.  Our brains are hard-wired to look for danger, giving weight to negative emotions over positive ones. The antidote for this bad habit is what Boardman calls ""micro-moments"" of positivity: seeking out the people or things that bring you joy. ""A meaningful connection or an uplifting activity enhances our resilience by acting as a buffer between us and the stress we'll inevitably encounter in our lives,"" she says.Think about how you can incorporate these moments – calling a friend or listening to your favorite music, for example – into your routine. Boardman suggests setting reminders on your phone for such activities so you don't let your ""well-spring of vitality run dry."" Social media has been widely linked to anxiety and depression in both teenagers and adults, undermining our well-being and emotional resilience. While it's not feasible to quit the internet cold turkey, Boardman recommends evaluating your tech habits to see if there are any pages, or people, you should reduce or eliminate from your consumption. ""Channel [tidying expert] Marie Kondo: If something doesn't spark joy on some level, if it makes you feel bad, mute it, or limit the time you're spending on it,"" she says, adding that we should aim to spend ""less than two hours"" online outside of work.  Setting boundaries is a critical skill for becoming resilient as it helps you choose what you allow inside your life. ""Resilience is often confused with independence, like, 'let me shrink as much as I can to support others,'"" Jackson says. ""But resilience should be more about prioritizing your needs."" She continues: ""If you have dinner plans with a friend, for example, but you need to stay home and rest, you shouldn't feel bad about rescheduling – or if you need additional support at work because your brain is scattered, ask a manager or teammate for that."" Discussing your boundaries might feel intimidating or uncomfortable at first, but gradually sharing your feelings and saying ""no"" without guilt can mean that you're not wasting your ""finite energy"" on things that are bad for your mental health, Jackson says. ""Life feels pretty stressful for most people right now,"" she adds. ""It's important to know your threshold, know your boundaries and honor those before you burn out.""Check out:Is the news cycle stressing you out?

2022-04-04,"U.K. Finance Minister Rishi Sunak has asked the Royal Mint to create and issue the NFT ""by the summer,"" a government minister said Monday.City Minister John Glen announced a number of steps the U.K. will take to bring digital assets under more regulatory scrutiny.He says the government wants Britain to ""lead the way"" in crypto. LONDON — The U.K. government on Monday announced plans to mint its own non-fungible token, as part of a push toward becoming a ""world leader"" in the cryptocurrency space.Finance Minister Rishi Sunak has asked the Royal Mint — the government-owned company responsible for minting coins for the U.K. — to create and issue the NFT ""by the summer,"" City Minister John Glen said at a fintech event in London. ""There will be more details available very soon,"" he added.NFTs are digital assets that represent ownership of a virtual item like an artwork or video game avatar using blockchain, the technology that underpins many cryptocurrencies. They've gained a lot of traction over the past year thanks to increased adoption from celebrities and large corporations.The U.K.'s NFT initiative is part of a broader effort by the government to ""lead the way"" in crypto, according to Glen. The minister announced a number of steps the U.K. will take to bring digital assets under more regulatory scrutiny, including plans to:Bring stablecoins within the U.K.'s existing regulations on electronic payments.Consult on a ""world-leading regime"" for regulating trade in other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.Ask the Law Commission to consider the legal status of blockchain-based communities known as decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs.Examine the tax treatment of decentralized finance (DeFi) loans and ""staking,"" which gives crypto users the ability to earn interest on their savings.Establish a Cryptoasset Engagement Group that will be chaired by ministers and host members from U.K. regulators and crypto businesses.Explore the application of blockchain technology in issuing debt instruments.""We shouldn't be thinking of regulation as a static, rigid thing,"" Glen said. ""Instead, we should be thinking in terms of regulatory 'code' — like computer code — which we refine and rewrite when we need to.""CNBC previously reported on the government's plans to unveil a regulatory framework for cryptoassets and stablecoins. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that derive their value from sovereign currencies like the U.S dollar, are a fast-growing but controversial phenomena in the crypto world. Tether, the world's biggest stablecoin, has a circulating supply of more than $80 billion. But it's attracted criticism over a lack of transparency around the reserves that back the token. The government is now set to bring stablecoins into the U.K. regulatory system.Glen said the government was also ""widening"" its gaze to look at other aspects of crypto, including so-called Web3, a movement that proposes a more decentralized version of the internet built on blockchain technology.""No one knows for sure yet how Web3 is going to look,"" Glen said. ""But there's every chance that blockchain is going to be integral to its development.""""We want this country to be there leading from the front, seeking out the greatest economic opportunities.""Mauricio Magaldi, global strategy director for crypto at the fintech consultancy 11:FS, took a skeptical view on the government's NFT plans. The decision ""seems to be nothing more than a strategic PR-play,"" he said in an emailed comment. But ""talk of the U.K. becoming a 'crypto hub' seems to hold much more promise,"" he added. Industry insiders have been calling for clarity about the U.K.'s position on crypto as policymakers around the world begin taking a closer look at the $2 trillion market. Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order urging government-wide coordination when it comes to regulating crypto. The move was seen as broadly positive for the sector.Meanwhile, European Union lawmakers recently voted against measures that would have put the future of crypto mining at risk. However, they also passed new rules cracking down on anonymous crypto transfers.Back in the U.K., British regulators have taken a harsh tone on digital assets.The Financial Conduct Authority has shunned a vast majority of crypto firms applying to be registered with the watchdog, warning it's worried too many ""financial crime red flags"" are going unnoticed.Last week, the FCA extended a crucial deadline for crypto businesses on a temporary register — which includes Revolut and Copper — to obtain full authorization. Philip Hammond, the former U.K. finance minister, is an advisor to Copper.Several companies have been forced to wind down their U.K. crypto operations and move offshore after failing to make it onto the final register, including Blockchain.com, B2C2 and Wirex. Just 33 firms have been approved by the FCA."
2022-04-04,"SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Monday announced several initiatives to expand investor protections in the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market.Gensler said the agency plans to register and regulate crypto platforms, and will look into separating out asset custody.The financial regulator will partner with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to address platforms trading crypto-based security tokens and commodity tokens. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said on Monday that his agency is aiming to exercise greater regulatory oversight of the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market to protect investors from an onslaught of scams.In a speech delivered virtually, Gensler said the SEC plans to register and regulate crypto platforms, including working to separate out the custody of assets to minimize risk.""These crypto platforms play roles similar to those of traditional regulated exchanges,"" Gensler said, at the Penn Law Capital Markets Association's annual conference. ""Thus, investors should be protected in the same way.""Gensler is providing details about his plans to address the crypto market almost a month after President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. Last year, crypto assets worth more than $14 billion were stolen through a host of scams as well as cyberattacks.The SEC, Gensler said, will partner with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to address platforms that trade both crypto-based security tokens and commodity tokens, as the SEC currently only oversees those that trade securities.Gensler compared crypto-asset platforms to alternative trading systems, which are used in equity and fixed income markets. The critical difference, he said, is that the latter is used primarily by institutional investors while crypto platforms ""have millions and sometimes tens of millions of retail customers directly buying and selling on the platform without going through a broker.""He said the SEC will look into whether crypto platforms should be treated by his agency more like retail exchanges.Gensler also addressed what the SEC can do in the areas of stablecoins and crypto tokens.Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to be less volatile than cryptocurrencies by pegging their market value to an outside asset like the U.S. dollar. Gensler said the $183 billion stablecoin market presents concerns, such as the potential use in illegal activity. Crypto-to-crypto transactions, he said, allow users to skirt the traditional banking system, making it harder to track money laundering, taxes and compliance.Stablecoins are also often owned by crypto platforms, creating potential ""conflicts of interest and market integrity questions that would benefit from more oversight,"" Gensler said.With respect to crypto tokens, the SEC chief said most of them involve entrepreneurs raising money from outside investors with the hope of creating a profitable business. Traditional companies raising capital from the public in such a fashion have to take the added step of filing significant disclosures with the SEC.Gensler reiterated comments made by his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who said ""most crypto tokens are investment contracts under the Howey Test."" He was referring to a 1946 Supreme Court ruling that a transaction is an investment contract when people are putting money into a ""common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others,"" Gensler explained.He added that regulators have long had effective ways to regulate financial markets, and the emergence of new technologies doesn't mean we throw out the playbook.""We ought to apply these same protections in the crypto markets,"" Gensler said. ""Let's not risk undermining 90 years of securities laws and create some regulatory arbitrage or loopholes.""WATCH: How fast-moving crypto start-ups lured top talent from Wall Street"

2022-04-05,"Blockchain start-up Lightning Labs announced Tuesday that it is launching the Taro protocol, a technology that will route fiat-pegged stablecoins and other digital assets through the bitcoin monetary network.Taro uses Lightning – a payments platform built on top of bitcoin's base layer that enables global, high volume, virtually instantaneous, and low-fee transactions using the security of the bitcoin blockchain. There's a new and low-cost way to quickly send U.S. digital dollars around the world without a bank. And it's built on bitcoin.Blockchain start-up Lightning Labs announced Tuesday that it's launching the Taro protocol, a technology that will route fiat-pegged stablecoins and other digital assets through the bitcoin monetary network. The project is still in development mode.Taro uses Lightning, a payments platform built on top of bitcoin's base layer that enables global, high volume, virtually instantaneous, and low-fee transactions using the security of the bitcoin blockchain.""It's one of those things where people don't really know how the credit card system works – and it just works,"" Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark told CNBC.Typically, this 'layer two' payments platform is all about making bitcoin easier to spend and receive – but Lightning Labs has decided to extend the use case of this tech to other types of virtual cash.""With this technology, you could route all the world's currencies through bitcoin,"" said Stark.""People will be able to seamlessly go between bitcoin and say, a USD stablecoin, or peso, euro, yen, etc. And they can send those globally, instantly and with extremely low fees,"" she said. There is bitcoin, the asset class, and then there's the global interoperable bitcoin monetary network. Lightning Labs is piggybacking off the latter.You can think of Taro's payment workflow as enabling bitcoin to serve as a hybrid of the SWIFT financial messaging system (the communication layer) and correspondent banking (routing component).Typically, all nodes must agree to confirm a transaction on the bitcoin network, verifying every transaction on the blockchain. The process highlights one of bitcoin's greatest strengths: its high degree of network decentralization, which is a big part of what ensures its security. But it is also relatively slow, averaging five transactions per second on bitcoin's base layer, and can be expensive.On the Lightning Network, not all participants in the network need to agree. Instead, nodes only verify transactions with which they are directly interacting.That difference is key. Stark tells CNBC that it's possible to execute hundreds of thousands of transactions per second on Lightning.And then there's the cost.""Lightning transactions can be fractions of a penny...while a bitcoin transaction at the core protocol layer can be much more expensive than that,"" said Alyse Killeen, founder and managing partner of bitcoin-focused venture firm Stillmark.Twitter integrated Lightning tipping in 2021 and the technology is already deployed around the world in places like El Salvador, which made bitcoin legal tender in Sept. 2021.But Lightning Labs says that the Taro protocol marks a major step in Lightning's capacity to serve as the underlying value transfer protocol of the internet.""From our standpoint, we're particularly interested in the fiat and stablecoin aspects, because we're really big into emerging markets,"" explained Stark. ""That's something near and dear to our hearts. We've seen a lot of adoption there, and there's a big demand for that.""The ultimate goal is to create a frictionless on-ramp to the global economy requiring only a mobile phone, in order to include as many people as possible in the process.Lightning Labs – which also announced it raised $70 million in Series B funding led by early Tesla and SpaceX backer Valor Equity Partners – says it is releasing the technical spec for the Taro protocol, so that it can incorporate feedback from developers as it continues to build the protocol."

2022-04-06,"In a space filled with venture investors and traders, a blockchain fund run by value managers thinks it can give investors greater returns than bitcoin itself.Bitcoin has been called the best performing asset of the decade by some. Off the Chain Capital, a fund that deploys a traditional value investing strategy – using fundamental analysis to find undervalued assets – says its fund has outperformed bitcoin in each of the last five years.The fund has averaged 133% per year since its inception in 2016, compared to about 108% per year on average for bitcoin, according to Off the Chain. The firm used the compound annual growth rate for both the fund and bitcoin using a beginning date of Dec. 31, 2016 and ending Feb. 28, 2022.""We've outperformed bitcoin five out of five years, and we've done it with 80% less volatility than bitcoin,"" said Brian Estes, the fund's CEO and chief investment officer. ""That's what I'm really proud of, because I built this so endowments, foundations and other conservative investors could gain exposure to blockchain assets and get that downside protection.""It also said it has outperformed the S&P 500 by 3,653% in the same period, and is 99.99% uncorrelated to the broad market index, meaning the two do not move up and down in tandem. The fund's strategy is to find mispriced assets in the blockchain space.It aims to buy one dollar's worth of blockchain assets for 50 cents and make returns on the purchase of the assets, rather than buying them at fair market value and letting them rise. This way it can apply a value approach while capturing the growth of the still-young industry.For example, Off the Chain was a big buyer of shares of Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital two years ago, which went for about 70 cents then, Estes said. The stock closed Tuesday at $15.79 a share.Silvergate Bank is another company being mispriced, according to Estes. The crypto-friendly bank went public two years ago and was valued as a bank, when it operates like a crypto company.""It was being valued at eight times earnings, and three times book value and what people didn't understand is that Silvergate is not a bank, it's a crypto company that basically has a monopoly on most of the crypto companies.""As a result, its earnings are growing at more than 100% a year, he added.Private equity accounts for about half of the portfolio. The firm also looks for mispriced digital assets, including bitcoin. Off the Chain is one of the largest buyers of Mt. Gox bankruptcy claims. Mt. Gox was once the largest custodian of bitcoin until a Russian hacker stole nearly all of it — about 740,000 bitcoins then worth $460 million.The fund buys those claims from people at an average discount of about 80%, Estes said.""It is our view that bitcoin is the winner of the store of value and is a major diversification instrument for portfolio allocators. If you can't outperform bitcoin as a fund, you might as well just own bitcoin and not pay fees to manage,"" Purcell said.It also sees both Binance and its utility token, BNB, as undervalued assets.""It is currently valued the same as Coinbase, but it trades about 4.2 times the volume of Coinbase,"" Purcell said of the exchange. ""They've also developed the Binance Smart Chain, which is taking developers away from other communities such as Ethereum, and we believe that is a value play.""The fund currently has about 200 limited partners and $399 million under management. It mainly targets institutions, endowments, family offices and other high net worth individuals for about a $1 million minimum.Estes said the fund currently has capacity for another $200 million to come into the fund. It's also ""very likely to be opening a bitcoin artificial intelligent algorithmic trading fund over the next six months."""

However, exchanging assets after less than one year creates short-term capital gains, with regular income tax rates, up to 37% for top earners.This tax season, filers must respond to a yes-or-no question about ""virtual currency"" on the front page of their tax return. You may answer no if you bought and held cryptocurrency with U.S. dollars or transferred coins between your wallets.However, you'll have to say yes if you sold cryptocurrency, exchanged one virtual coin for another, used it to make a purchase, received it as payment, acquired it through mining or staking and more.   With cryptocurrency exchanges still not required to send Form 1099-B, covering profits and losses from yearly transactions, it may be challenging to calculate your tax bill, particularly with a large volume of activity.""My advice would be to take your time and get it right,"" Metras said. If you need help, you won't likely find a crypto tax professional before the deadline. However, filing an extension ""buys you more time,"" he added, to gather information and schedule an appointment.Crypto tax software may help reconcile transactions, but it may not be 100% accurate, Metras warned. ""Make sure you're reviewing the stuff that's coming out of it.""If your capital losses exceed capital gains, there's an opportunity to write off up to $3,000 per year to offset regular income, Chandrasekera said, and if losses exceed $3,000, you can carry it forward into future years. "
2022-04-06,"Jack Dorsey says he has regrets about the social media giant he co-founded.Dorsey, who announced plans to leave Twitter in November, recently tweeted that he feels guilty about the role the company has played in creating a centralized internet, where a small handful of companies and platforms claim an outsized proportion of users and their data. With 217 million daily users, Twitter certainly qualifies as one of those platforms, along with other tech giants like Meta, Alphabet and Amazon.""I realize I'm partially to blame, and regret it,"" Dorsey wrote in his April 2 tweet.The rueful admission comes amid Dorsey's attempts to extricate himself from Twitter: He stepped down as the company's CEO last year, and will leave its board of directors next month.In his tweet, Dorsey referenced a few nostalgic elements from the early days of the internet, including online public bulletin board and discussion network Usenet, text-based chat platform Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and email encrypted with the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) software program.Dorsey called those types of features ""amazing"" and lamented that ""centralizing discovery and identity into corporations really damaged the internet."" Twitter is one example of internet centralization: It's a popular source of information and news at least partially because hundreds of millions of users already have accounts.Similarly, Alphabet-owned Google captures more than 90% of the online search market, according to StatCounter. Research from eMarketer shows that roughly 64% of all digital ad spending going to Amazon, Facebook and Google. Dorsey has said before that he regretted not having a plan for how Twitter's growth could affect the way people use the internet and share information online. The company was founded, in part, as a way to ""decentralize"" information sources online by allowing a wider range of people to connect and share posts, Dorsey noted in 2019.A year later, Dorsey told The New York Times that a lack of foresight by Twitter's founders, including himself, meant they weren't prepared for the effects of seemingly small decisions — like including ""like"" counters on tweets, which he said incentivized ""the most salacious or controversial tweets.""Dorsey, who ran Twitter from 2006 to 2008 and again from 2015 to 2021, has also argued that the platform should be more transparent about how it displays and promotes tweets by publishing its algorithms. Such a move could be gaining popularity inside the company: Last month, billionaire and new Twitter board member Elon Musk tweeted that Twitter's algorithms should be ""open source.""Publishing Twitter's algorithms could have a side-effect that Dorsey might like: People would be able to create their own versions of Twitter, and communicate across all of them, potentially encouraging a less centralized internet. It's even possible that such a result is the primary goal for Dorsey, who launched a team at Twitter called Bluesky in 2019 to research long-term decentralized standards for social media.Bluesky's leader was none other than Parag Agrawal, who was then Twitter's CTO and is now the company's CEO. And with Musk now getting included in Bluesky's direction, according to Reuters, Dorsey's vision of decentralized social media is unlikely to diminish once he leaves Twitter's board — potentially helping ease some of those regrets about the internet landscape he helped create.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Here's how much power Elon Musk actually has at Twitter now — and what he might do with itTwitter's new 37-year-old CEO went from Twitter engineer to CEO in just 10 years"
2022-04-07,"This is an excerpt from the CNBC Make It newsletter. Subscribe here.The April 18 tax deadline is less than two weeks away. For many Americans, it will be the first time they will need to report cryptocurrency transactions to the Internal Revenue Service.  It's a process that can be tricky, especially if you aren't familiar with the rules. In particular, there are two misconceptions that commonly trip up crypto investors come tax time, says Austin Woodward, a certified public accountant and CEO of crypto accounting platform TaxBit. Woodward often has to clear up the belief that cryptocurrencies are ""anonymous,"" he says. Many people think that if they bought only $250 worth of crypto and sold it at $350, the $100 profit is small enough that they can get away with not reporting it.But failing to report crypto gains could result in a lengthy IRS audit and possible fines, Woodward says. The IRS has ""a lot of infrastructure and teams in place to go after known cryptocurrency users that don't report,"" he says. Investors need to be diligent and transparent about their crypto holdings, no matter how small.   Crypto investors also commonly think that if they never exchanged their crypto for fiat currency, then they don't need to mention it on their tax return, Woodward says.However, there are a number of other taxable scenarios that need to be reported. Here are a few examples:You exchanged one cryptocurrency for another (e.g. you traded your bitcoin for ether)You received interest on your holdings if you have a crypto savings accountYou received any amount of cryptocurrency as a giftYou used crypto to make a purchaseThe first item taxpayers will encounter on their 1040 forms after filling out their contact information is a question asking if ""at any time during 2021, did [they] receive, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in any virtual currency.""""If you just bought it and didn't sell anything, you can actually answer 'no' to that question because you do not have any taxable gains or losses to report,"" Woodward says.But if you bought and sold cryptocurrency, or otherwise spent your crypto or exchanged it for other digital tokens, you must respond ""yes.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Take advantage of these 6 perks to make the most of your Amazon Prime membership"
2022-04-07,"At a bitcoin conference in Miami, venture investor Peter Thiel presented a slideshow that included criticisms of financial opinion leaders who he says are trying to stop the cryptocurrency.Thiel called Warren Buffett a ""sociopathic grandpa from Omaha.""He also took aim at JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and BlackRock's Larry Fink. At a bitcoin conference Thursday, billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel said Warren Buffett tops an ""enemies list"" of people who are trying to stop the cryptocurrency.""Enemy No. 1,"" Thiel said to a booing Miami crowd, is ""the sociopathic grandpa from Omaha."" Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is based in Omaha, Nebraska.Thiel, who by 2018 had reportedly amassed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin through venture firm Founders Fund, also called out JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Thiel presented large graphics with images of the two financial executives and their bearish comments about bitcoin.The images all contained the word ""gerontocracy.” About Dimon, Thiel said his views are part of ""the New York City banker bias.""  Thiel held up a headshot of Buffett with the words ""rat poison"" on it, referring to the time the Berkshire CEO dismissed bitcoin using that phrase. Another quote from Buffett read, ""I don't own any and I never will."" Earlier this year, Berkshire invested $1 billion in Brazil's Nubank, an online bank that's popular among crypto investors.The Miami tirade is Thiel’s latest and boldest public attack on the people he sees as standing in the way of bitcoin's progress.“This is what we have to fight for bitcoin to go 10x or 100x from here,” Thiel said. Stock picks and investing trends from CNBC Pro:The Fed could enact a 'substitute' interest rate hike at its June meetingBuy this resilient regional bank trading at a 50% discount, Bank of America saysWhat to buy after the Fed stops hiking rates, according to Bank of America The Fed could enact a 'substitute' interest rate hike at its June meetingBuy this resilient regional bank trading at a 50% discount, Bank of America saysWhat to buy after the Fed stops hiking rates, according to Bank of America He added that those investors are fine touting blockchain, the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency, but feel the need to take down bitcoin and its legitimacy.""When they choose not to allocate to bitcoin, that’s a deeply political choice,"" said Thiel, a prominent backer of Republican politicians, most notably former President Donald Trump. Buffett, Thiel said, invests in a ""list of woke companies.""At one point, Thiel presented a colorful photo of Miami next to the word “youth.”""We need to say, you know, you have to get on board with this,"" he said.A representative from Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, and a JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment for this story.A BlackRock spokesperson pointed CNBC to comments Fink made in his letter to shareholders last month. He wrote that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could accelerate adoption of digital currencies and said ""a global digital payment system, thoughtfully designed, can enhance the settlement of international transactions while reducing the risk of money laundering and corruption."""
2022-04-07,"EToro is launching a fund to support new digital art in a first step toward broader expansion of NFT investment services.Pushing into NFTs will allow the company to expand and diversify its investor base and business partnerships, according to U.S. Managing Director Guy Hirsch.Hirsch said the processes for valuing and appraising digital art need to become more sophisticated, but they're on their way. Trading platform eToro unveiled a $20 million fund to purchase NFTs and bolster creators. The firm announced the launch at The Bass, a contemporary art museum in Miami, Thursday.The trading platform's fund is part of a new initiative called eToro.art, which aims to support NFT creators and brands.Guy Hirsch, eToro's U.S. managing director, said the new fund marked the beginning of a greater NFT strategy for the company, which will eventually offer a multitude of services to allow investors to participate in the emerging economy.NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, are digital assets that represent real-world objects — such as art, music, real estate and beyond — and can't be replicated.""Before, with bitcoin and ether, you had only the likes of Goldman Sachs or similar traditional financial players participating or looking at expanding into crypto,"" Hirsch told CNBC. ""NFTs are essentially making any and every potential brand a participant in this market.""As part of its new initiative, eToro showcased its digital art collection, which includes well-known projects, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks and World of Women. Further, eToro plans to commit $10 million to support emerging creators and brands in bringing their new NFT projects to market this year.Digital art is just one use case for NFTs. Hirsch said eToro plans to add capabilities that will give customers exposure to use cases beyond digital art.In the past few months alone big brands from every industry, including Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Nike, Gucci, the National Football League and more, have brought NFTs into their marketing initiatives.""Any brand can hone in on this and create some sort of an NFT that represents an ownership stake in part of the brand,"" Hirsch added.Valuing digital art Investors have struggled to see value in digital art and are perplexed by big sales, such as Beeple's piece, which sold at Christie's for $69 million.Price discovery in digital art and knowing what to buy are still big question marks, but the industry is working on it, Hirsch said. Today, investors typically use the floor price, or the minimum amount of money you can spend to buy an item from a collection.""It needs to be more sophisticated than that,"" Hirsch said. ""We see new services emerging that will be akin to the appraisal process of traditional art. Within a year or two we'll have third-party services that will appraise individual pieces and give you an approximate price on what you're about to buy or what you own in a way that would be agreed on by market participants.""Art has been a strong asset class for decades, but only for the super rich, Hirsch noted. EToro is looking to bring both new artists and new investors together to help both build their wealth in this new way.NFTs from some of the ""blue-chip"" projects in eToro's collection already go for a minimum of hundreds of thousands of dollars on OpenSea, the largest marketplace for NFTs. That's hardly accessible to smaller investors, but the company expects that many of the lesser-known digital artists whose work it'll help bring to market won't be priced like a Bored Ape — a popular collection that's lured celebrity buyers.""When these artists create a collection or NFT drop, the price on those would be quite low,"" Hirsch said. ""People would be able to participate, and if the community is strong and if the art is promising, it will appreciate in value, but the entry point would still be accessible to the everyday investor.""""Some of them will, hopefully, reach the point of Bored Ape status,"" he added. ""Eventually, like the Bored Apes, that will create a lot of new millionaires, a lot of new wealth for people who didn't have it before."""
2022-04-08,"Wood said the amount of interest investors are showing in or decentralized finance could threaten the traditional banking world Cryptocurrency was initially created to sidestep old institutions – and banks may finally be feeling themselves get disrupted, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said.Known for her high risk high reward strategy, Wood told CNBC's ""Crypto World"" Thursday that the amount of interest investors are showing in DeFi, or decentralized finance, applications could threaten the traditional banking world. There's been a ""share shift"" when it comes to loans in DeFi, she said.""Banks have a big problem,"" Wood said from the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami. ""They're losing talent to crypto, so they're having to raise wages to attract talent, and they're losing business to DeFi. Lending and saving – a lot of it is taking place in DeFi right now.""Decentralized finance is an umbrella term for the various financial products and services that are peer-to-peer, built on blockchains, and eliminate the need for the traditional institutions that have historically provided access to those services. Political institutions are another part of the establishment is starting to respond to crypto in a more positive way, Wood said.""What we're seeing is 180 degrees different today than it was a year ago,"" she said.She noted the shift in stance from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who had previously expressed concern on crypto, averse to its potential environmental problems and risk of illicit activity.""I remember I was asked at the time and I basically said she hasn't studied the technology and she hasn't studied the instruments of the new asset class. Well, it seems like she's been boning up,"" Wood said.Ark was the first public asset manager to gain exposure to bitcoin, in September 2015.

2022-04-08,"Blockstream and Jack Dorsey's Block, formerly Square, are breaking ground on a solar- and battery-powered bitcoin mine in Texas using solar and storage technology from Tesla.Tesla's 3.8 megawatt solar PV array and 12 megawatt-hour Megapack will power the facility. MIAMI — Blockstream and Jack Dorsey's Block, formerly Square, are breaking ground on a solar- and battery-powered bitcoin mine in Texas that uses solar and storage technology from Tesla.Tesla's 3.8 megawatt solar PV array and 12 megawatt-hour Megapack will power the facility.Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back, a British cryptographer and a member of the ""cypherpunk"" crew, told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami that the mining facility is designed to be a proof of concept for 100% renewable energy bitcoin mining at scale.""People like to debate about the different factors to do with bitcoin mining. We figured, let's just prove it. Have an open dashboard so people can play along, maybe it can inform other players to participate,"" Back said.The dashboard will be publicly accessible and show real-time metrics of the project's performance, including power output and total bitcoin mined. The company said a later version of the dashboard will also include solar and storage performance data points.""This is a step to proving our thesis that bitcoin mining can fund zero-emission power infrastructure and build economic growth for the future,"" Back said. West Texas is a mecca of renewable energy in the United States. ""You get this perfect overlap with both sun quality and wind speed in West Texas,"" said Shaun Connell, executive vice president of power at Houston-based tech company Lancium. But a lot of that wind and solar power is concentrated in remote parts of the state. With no financial incentive, there's little reason to build out renewable infrastructure to harness this energy.Enter bitcoin miners. When these energy buyers co-locate with renewables, it creates a financial incentive for buildout and improves the core economics of renewable power production, which has been fraught with volatility.Miners provide demand to these semi-stranded assets and make renewables in Texas economically viable, according to Castle Island Venture's Nic Carter.The constraint is that West Texas has roughly 34 gigawatts of power, five gigawatts of demand, and only 12 gigawatts of transmission. You can think of bitcoin miners as temporary buyers who keep the energy assets operational until the grid is able to fully absorb them.Back said the off-grid mine, expected to be completed later this year, highlights another key tenet of the bitcoin network: Miners are location agnostic and can ""do it from anywhere without local infrastructure.""Should the project prove profitable in its pilot stage, Back said, the companies would add wind power to the mix and scale the entire project.""You're making a sort of calculation of the optimal economic mix between solar and battery,"" Back said. ""There's 3.8 megawatts of solar and one megawatt of mining, so you can see you have to overprovision, because the peak solar input varies during the day and, of course, it's not there at night.""Adding wind to the mix, however, would reduce overall costs and help to balance out the downtime with solar.Ultimately, Blockstream said, a key goal is to strengthen the bitcoin network by diversifying the cryptocurrency's energy sources.""By collaborating on this full-stack, 100% solar-powered bitcoin mining project with Blockstream, using solar and storage technology from Tesla, we aim to further accelerate bitcoin's synergy with renewables,"" said Neil Jorgensen, global ESG lead at Block and project lead for Block's Bitcoin Clean Energy Initiative."
2022-04-08,"My first experience with one of the men Peter Thiel called a ""sociopathic grandpa from Omaha"" was in the early 1990s.Joe Kernen and I were winding up a ""stocks to watch"" segment and discussing Berkshire Hathaway's earnings. As part of that discussion, we chatted about our favorite companies within Warren Buffett's portfolio.Mine was See's Candy, having spent 17 years of my life in Southern California, where See's was sold. Joe's was NetJets.Suffice to say, less than 24 hours later, there were two large boxes on my desk in which were 10 pounds of See's candy and a note, ""Thanks for the mention. Warren.""I had never met Buffett before so I gave him a call, thanked for the candy, assured him I had no intention of sharing it with my colleagues.He laughed and told me to tell Joe not to expect a jet. Since then, we have had a cordial professional and personal relationship. As I also have had with Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink, both of whom on Thursday joined Buffett as being identified by libertarian investor Thiel as part of a ""finance gerontocracy."" The group is holding back the further development of Bitcoin to protect its own financial interests, Thiel said.It's a bit of the pot calling the kettle black, since Thiel is using that criticism to defend and tout his holdings of bitcoin.Further, I have never in my dealings with any of these gentlemen found them to be sociopathic, backward-looking or unwilling to accept new ideas, or technologies, if they could profit from their use in mainstream finance.Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest single investor of our lifetime, Dimon, our most savvy bank CEO, and Fink, whose $10 trillion-plus investment company pioneered more accessible ways for the public to invest, is the builder of the biggest asset manager in the world.This does not mean that these aging titans of business are infallible, nor are they entirely without blemish nor missed opportunities.They are, however, students of money and market history, astute investors and wealthy, especially Buffett, beyond our wildest dreams.In fact, you would need to total the net worth of all the world's crypto billionaires to surpass Buffett's wealth.Some will accuse me of pandering to these men. I am well beyond the point of pandering, either in my life and or in my career. In point of fact, I never pandered at all. Never needed to.What I have found among Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts, or supporters, though, is that they try far too hard to convince the world that a new global currency is necessary to democratize finance and offer assistance to those with little access to banking, payment systems or investible assets.You can simply achieve that by giving everyone in the world a smart phone and links to simple financial apps. Bitcoin remains a solution in search of a problem.Payment systems are evolving rapidly, giving many benefits to consumers from reduced transaction costs, to secure payments to smart contracts and to speedier processing and clearing, all of which are happening even as Bitcoin's value stalls.Blockchain and Ethereum are largely responsible for that payment systems revolution while other systems are emerging even more rapidly that will create increasing efficiencies from which consumers will benefit, with or without bitcoin or the 12,000 other crypto currencies minted thus far.Thiel's highly personal attack on Buffett, Dimon and Fink does nothing to make the case for bitcoin.On its own, bitcoin is far too volatile to stand as a unit of account, a medium of exchange or, arguably, a store of value — in short, it has none of the properties that define a currency, or money, at all.I have been horribly wrong on the price of Bitcoin. But not so much on its use case.It still represents a small fraction of the world's currency system. Its $820 billion market value (whatever that means for a ""currency"") is small when compared to dollars in circulation globally and pales in comparison to the $13 trillion value of the world's outstanding stash of gold, the hard currency of choice for most of the planet.Thiel believes that wealthy, powerful men like Buffett, Dimon and Fink are suppressing what he describes as a ""revolutionary youth movement.""Perhaps.Perhaps the other explanation is that maybe, like many of us approaching, or exceeding, retirement age, we've witnessed so many investment cycles, so many fads, manias and bubbles that we can more readily and easily identify flights of financial fancy that we remain more naturally dubious.And we would prefer to warn the public of their inherent risks that trade them for personal reward. If this be sociopathy, then let's make the most of it!"

The firm said the move is an initial step toward becoming a ""fully-regulated virtual asset service provider"" in the city.It's the second city Binance has secured approval from — the company received a crypto license in Dubai last month. The move also comes after Binance was authorized in Bahrain by the country's central bank. Binance has been pushing into the Middle East market after getting a frosty reception elsewhere.In the U.K., regulators placed restrictions on the firm, barring it from undertaking any regulated activity. In Singapore, it limited its service after the country's central bank warned it may be in violation of local payment laws.In response to a tweet from CNBC, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the company is ""not shunned elsewhere"" and that there's ""more to come.""Previously, Binance was notorious for its tendency to operate independently of local regulations. The company's chief up until recently took pride in having no official headquarters. However, in response to pressure from global regulators, Binance has changed tack, saying it wants to become a regulated business. The firm is currently evaluating where to establish its main office.Several crypto companies, including Crypto.com and FTX, are looking to Gulf states like the UAE as a destination to set up shop. But the region is opening its doors to the loosely regulated world of crypto at an awkward time — the UAE was recently placed on a ""gray list"" by the Financial Action Task Force, a global money laundering watchdog."
2022-04-11,"The price of bitcoin stumbled on Monday as investors assessed the risks from rising rates and the potential for more tightening by the Federal Reserve.Bitcoin last fell 7% to $40,009.78, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day it fell to $39,785.68, falling below the key $40,000 support level for the first time since Mar. 16.The decline came after the 10-year Treasury yield hit a three-year high of 2.78% Monday. Riskier assets tend to fall when yields rise. On Monday the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down by more than 1%.

2022-04-11,"Exchange, the biggest ETF conference in the world, starts Monday in Miami Beach. It's both good times, and difficult times for the exchange-traded fund financial advice industry. Good times, because this is the first time the ETF industry and ETF-centric advisors have been together in over two years. But investors are throwing money at ETFs, mostly in the form of passive (indexed) funds, but also a smattering of actively managed funds. Assets under management have gone from $5 trillion to $7 trillion in less than two years. Difficult times, because the markets are in turmoil: There is a lot of money moving around, and advisors attending the event are looking for answers on what to tell their baffled clients about what is going on when they return home. The hot topics: Geopolitical risk takes a back seat to inflation worries.  A survey of thousands of financial advisors in the past two weeks by ETF Trends, one of the conference organizers, indicated that the No. 1 concern was rising interest rates: Which of the following concerns you the most about the markets right now?Rising interest rates/inflation      43%Geopolitical risk                             34%Prolonged economic slowdown  13%Market volatility                                8%Dividend sustainability                    2%Source: ETF Trends There's tons of money moving around. ""There's more money in motion than we've seen in a decade,"" conference organizer Tom Lydon from ETF Trends tells me. ""Investors and advisors are more concerned about the threat of rising rates and inflation on their fixed income assets than their equity assets."" Indeed, there are ample signs advisors are moving away from the traditional asset allocation of 60%/40% stocks to bonds. ""70/30 is the new 60/40,"" Lydon said. Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities are particularly under pressure, with many bond ETFs at or near new lows. Large-cap ETF Bond Funds: new lowsVanguard Total Bond (BND)Pimco Active Bond (BOND)iShares Core US Aggregate (AGG)iShares Investment Grade Corporate (LQD)iShares Muni Bond (MUB) At the same time, there are record levels in money market funds ($5 trillion) and short-duration bond ETFs. Equities:  Still inflows.  Even with the S&P 500 down 5% year to date, large, indexed equity ETFs continue to attract huge inflows, likely at the expense of their higher-cost mutual fund competitors. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has attracted $26 billion in inflows year to date, its competitor iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) $13 billion. Other megacap equity ETF funds like SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and Invesco QQQ (QQQ) have also seen inflows. Not doing well:  International, value and small-cap ETFs were off to a good start in January, but when Russia/Ukraine tension escalated, demand tapered off. Commodities: They're hot of course. The Invesco Optimum Yield Commodities ETF (PDBC), which is composed of futures contracts on 14 commodities, has been the leader this year, with $8 billion in assets. What's all this movement mean? ""It means investors are nervous,"" Dave Nadig, financial futurist at ETF Trends and another one of the conference organizers, tolde me. ""There is not a clear signal from the flows, but it's clear people are reallocating their portfolio. We are living in an extreme level of uncertainty. There's not one clear story. Some are worried about inflation. Some are worried about retirement income. Some are worried about Ukraine."" The crypto industry pushes back on the SEC.  A pure-play bitcoin ETF would be the biggest boost for the crypto community in years, but the SEC has denied applications year after year, opting instead to approve bitcoin futures ETFs.  But the industry wants a pure-play bitcoin ETF, and this may be the year the industry pushes back.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is awaiting a decision from the SEC on its application to convert to a bitcoin ETF, which is due by early July. Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale's CEO, has hinted he may sue the SEC if it turns him down. What are the legal grounds for a lawsuit? Sonnenshein is speaking Tuesday morning; we'll ask him on ETF Edge on Monday at 1 p.m. Active management: there are still firms jumping on the bandwagon. This year, Capital Group, which manages the American Funds, jumped into the active management ETF game. Neuberger Berman is also coming in. ""The floodgates are opening, and everyone is going to go into the active space,"" Nadig said. ""There's a whole generation that prefers ETFs. Every asset manager is going to have an ETF product.

2022-04-12,"There's no denying that with the Great Resignation, workers are more empowered to seek what they want from their jobs.Other than flexibility and better benefits, a new workplace perk is gaining popularity — the option of being paid in digital currency. According to a global poll by financial consultancy deVere Group, cryptocurrencies could become more commonplace in salary negotiations with younger workers. More than a third of millennials (those aged between 26 and 42) and half of Generation Z (25 and below) would be happy to receive half their salary in bitcoin or other forms of cryptocurrencies, revealed the study.A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that utilizes computer code and blockchain technology to operate somewhat on its own, without the need for a central party to manage the system. Another survey, by SoFi at Work and Workplace Intelligence of 800 U.S. employees, showed that 42% of them would like to receive non-fungible tokens as performance rewards.Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are unique assets that are verified and stored using blockchain technology — a digital ledger similar to the networks that underpin cryptocurrencies.Getting paid in digital currency is no doubt ""trendy,"" said Tony Jarvis, director of enterprise security in Asia-Pacific and Japan at cybersecurity start-up Darktrace.""Offering to pay your employees with Bitcoin can be a way to attract what we might call 'future-thinking workers', especially if you're in certain industries, like FinTech,"" he added. Indeed, SharpRank is one of the companies offering to pay in cryptocurrency in a bid to lure younger workers. It is an independent ratings agency that works with college students, who act as brand ambassadors.Chris Adams, its founder and CEO, likened the appeal of a crypto salary among the young to ""when Starbucks first became popular it was important to be seen with a Starbucks cup.""""It's very similar with respect to being able to have some sort of cryptocurrency because that's what all their friends are talking about.""  While offering cryptocurrency as salary has enabled companies to draw young talent, it comes with both rewards and risks for employees. CNBC Make It takes a look at both. Forget the waiting times, exchange fees and additional costs that come with traditional bank transactions — receiving payment in cryptocurrency can be really fast, and that gives employees a level of certainty, said Jarvis.""When your employer makes a payment to you using [digital currency], as soon as your employer makes that payment, the next second, it is in your account. You don't have to wait until the following day."" Given the growing interest in cryptocurrency among younger investors, it is ""no surprise"" that they would prefer getting paid in that way, said Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of CoinDCX, a cryptocurrency exchange platform.""They would immediately have access to and hold crypto in their portfolios, without having to convert from fiat, which factors in an additional transaction fee."" Fiat money refers to physical money backed by a government. When it comes to cryptocurrency tax laws, the country you're working in matters. Some countries are ""very lenient"" in that regard, said Jarvis.For instance, Portugal is known as a crypto tax haven for its 0% tax on bitcoin.""When you consider how much these assets are increasing over time, they are significant gains to be made if you're saving on that tax side of the equation,"" Jarvis added. However, more countries may tighten their reins over digital assets in the near future ""in a bid to enhance consumer trust and safety,"" said Gupta.Later this month, from April 18, individuals in United States will need to report cryptocurrency transactions to the Internal Revenue Service. Gupta added that similar measures have been implemented in India, where a 30% tax is imposed on income from cryptocurrency.""It is important for employees who are paid in crypto to be aware of how such changes affect owning and using crypto assets … staying constantly in the know of policy changes can allow users to react quickly to developments,"" he said. It's no secret that the crypto market is volatile.Even bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, is not immune from wild price fluctuations — it has fallen sharply since November, tumbling more than 40% from a record high of about $69,000.However, the growth of bitcoin's value over the past decade cannot be overlooked, given that its worth started off as ""a couple of dollars,"" said Jarvis.""If you're getting your salary payments by week or month, it goes in as a certain dollar value today and it grows automatically over time … there are some serious returns."" As for SharpRank's Adams, navigating the ups and downs of digital currency ""can be a very positive experience.""""We see that a number of kids go through cycles like that … let's say overnight, I wake up and [cryptocurrency] has devalued by 500%. The first thing I'm going to do is ask why and then I'm going figure out ways to make sure that may not happen again,"" added Adams.""I think that's an applicable skill in asset allocation and investing."" Even so, owning or getting paid in cryptocurrency may not be for the faint-hearted.""We found that the younger demographic, who might have a higher risk appetites, tend to see risk-reward through a different lens than somebody who has really only ever known being paid in cash,"" said Adams. Though cybersecurity threats aren't unique to cryptocurrency, industry experts CNBC Make It spoke to said breaches will ""persist as long as crypto remains popular.""""A lot of scammers and attackers are targeting crypto wallets — they're using social engineering in the exact same way we get phishing emails,"" said Jarvis.""And if you're not a security expert, knowing exactly how to secure those assets can be really, really hard. You're storing assets on a third party platform, so there's a risk there."" It's therefore important to choose a cryptocurrency platform that ""prioritizes safety and security,"" said Gupta.""Finding platforms that offer insurance of assets and barriers against money laundering will mitigate risk exposure when using digital finance.""Don't miss: Don’t make these 2 crypto mistakes on your taxesLike this story? Subscribe to CNBC Make It on YouTube!Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Chris Adams."

LONDON — Financial technology firm Plaid has hired Ripsy Bandourian, a long-time Booking.com executive, to head up its European operations.Bandourian joined Plaid last week and is working out of its Dutch offices in Amsterdam. She'll be tasked with leading the San Francisco-based start-up's expansion in continental Europe. Keith Grose, formerly Plaid's head of international, now focuses largely on running the U.K. business.The Armenian-born businesswoman brings a mix of experience to the world of fintech. She originally studied molecular biology at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, before moving to New York to take on a quantitative analyst job at Goldman Sachs. After a consulting stint with McKinsey, she moved to London to work at Apple's European division.Bandourian joined Booking.com in 2014, working for the online travel platform for more than eight years in a variety of roles focusing on product and marketing. She was most recently vice president of global accommodation partnerships, overseeing Booking.com's relationships with hotel partners.Bandourian told CNBC her reasons for joining Plaid were ""personal"" just as much as they were professional.""I've lived my life on three different continents,"" Bandourian said. ""And there is absolutely no way for me to take my financial history with me. There are no tools, there are no ways to make it easier. And this is a use case.""Plaid's technology allows fintech companies like Venmo and Robinhood to connect to customers' bank accounts so that users can log in and share their financial data securely. It's part of a fast-growing trend known as ""open banking.""The company, which also offers payment tools in some markets, says it's planning an ""aggressive"" expansion in Europe this year. Its services are currently available in seven European countries, including the U.K., Germany and France. Plaid also plans to roll out to other markets including Poland, Belgium and the Nordics soon.""The plans are quite aggressive,"" Bandourian said. ""The investment that Plaid is making in Europe speaks to the opportunity that the company sees itself, and how deeply and how fast we're evolving.""Among Plaid's plans for Europe is growing its headcount — the firm currently employs around 80 people in the region — and hiring individual country managers for France and Germany. Plaid's clients in Europe include crypto exchange Kraken and dating app Bumble.The open banking trend has gained significant traction in Europe over the years. That's thanks in part to fintech-friendly regulations introduced in 2018 requiring banks to share user data with third parties at the request of consumers.The number of open banking users in the continent reached 12.2 million in 2020, according to Statista data, a number that's expected to rise to 63.8 million by 2024.Big businesses and investors are taking note. Apple last month acquired Credit Kudos, a London-based fintech that uses consumers' banking data to make more informed credit checks. Meanwhile, Visa bought Tink, a European competitor to Plaid, for over $2 billion.Plaid was last privately valued at $13.4 billion after a $5.3 billion deal to be taken over by Visa fell apart."

2022-04-13,"As millions of Ukrainians evacuate en masse, among the many challenges they face is gaining access to their cash from abroad.Bitcoin's Lightning Network slashes the cost of transactions to virtually zero, cuts out middlemen like banks from the transfer, and enables nearly instantaneous cash payments around the planet. CNBC tested out an international transfer of cash with a Ukrainian staying in Poland via bitcoin's Lightning Network. Alena Vorobiova hadn't thought much about bitcoin before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Fast forward to border closures and shelling on her hometown, cash shortages at ATMs across the country, and the central bank suspending electronic cash transfers — and she decided to give bitcoin a try.Whereas money providers often charge transfer fees of 10% or more when you send $100 from the U.S. to Ukraine, bitcoin's Lightning Network, which is a payments platform built on bitcoin's base layer, slashes the cost of transactions to virtually zero.Vorobiova and CNBC decided to put Lightning payments to the test — with the expertise and translation skills of bitcoin developer Gleb Naumenko, who is currently hiding out in the western part of Ukraine as the war rages on.The bottom line? It really does work as well as bitcoin boosters say it does.The process of downloading a crypto wallet onto Vorobiova's phone, transferring bitcoin over the Lightning Network from the U.S. to Poland, and withdrawing the equivalent in Polish currency from a bitcoin ATM from the southwest city of Wrocław took less than three minutes. Last August on a road trip from Houston to Dallas, Peter McCormack — founder and host of the popular What Bitcoin Did' podcast — taught CNBC how to use the Lightning Network to make instant payments to anyone in the world.The tutorial took less than 60 seconds and involved four basic steps: We downloaded the Blue Wallet app and generated a one-time invoice in the form of a QR code. McCormack scanned that QR code using a similar app on his own phone, and then transferred 100,000 satoshis, or sats (the smallest denomination of bitcoin, about 0.00000001 BTC) from his account to ours. The total transfer was equivalent to about $50.Eight months later, from a hotel room in Miami on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference, CNBC decided to pay that knowledge — and some of those sats — forward.

Here's why the experts like itHere are Cowen's top chip picks for an EV and autonomous-auto future Goldman Sachs loves Uber, Meta and Amazon — and ranks them in order of preferenceBroadcom bolsters stock with new Apple deal. Here's why the experts like itHere are Cowen's top chip picks for an EV and autonomous-auto future On a three-way video call with Naumenko in Western Ukraine, Vorobiova in Southwest Poland, and CNBC in Miami, we followed a very similar sequence of events.With the guidance of Naumenko, Vorobiova downloaded the Muun wallet app, a different type of self-custodial wallet for bitcoin and Lightning, made a four-digit pin, and generated an invoice as a QR code. CNBC then captured that QR code using the scan mode in the Blue Wallet and transferred over 50,000 of sats from McCormack. The fees amounted to fractions of a penny. (For purposes of the experiment, Naumenko transferred another 50,000 because the bitcoin ATM had a minimum withdrawal amount.)Bitcoin developer Jeff Czyz tells CNBC that Lightning wallets are compatible because they all have to implement the Basis of Lightning Technology, or BOLT, specification, which defines a layer-2 protocol for sending payments across the Lightning Network.""A Lightning wallet app is akin to a bank, in that sending money between banks requires them to speak the same language,"" said Czyz, a developer with Jack Dorsey's team known as Spiral (formerly Square Crypto). That common language is the BOLT specification.""The Lightning Network consists of nodes connected by payment channels, which are used to forward payments across the network without the need to trust intermediaries,"" continued Czyz. Just like the tutorial in the car, the process of transferring sats from Miami to Wrocław also took about a minute.From there, Vorobiova — who followed her sister and niece to the Polish city of Wrocław to help them get settled — went to one of the fifteen bitcoin ATMs in Wrocław and requested a withdrawal.She accomplished this by using a QR code that the ATM spit out. She scanned the QR code into her phone using the Muun app, transferred her bitcoin into the ATM's account, and the ATM in turn issued the money. She ended up with 170 zloty, the Polish currency, worth about 100,000 sats or $40. The ATM company took a fee of 10 zloty, or about 5.5% of the total transaction.""That's the same flow as making a payment for a good or service using Lightning,"" explained Czyz.For Vorobiova, this was more of a fun experiment. She is able to go back and forth from Ukraine to Poland, and she tells CNBC that she is following the guidance of Ukrainian regulators to just use credit cards for the time being.But the process illustrates how refugees with no cash and no way of accessing their belongings can use crypto wallets for banking.Some Ukrainians use it to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions, while others have found that Lightning is a cheap and fast way to receive donations and remittances from anywhere in the world. In Poland, for example, there are more than 175 bitcoin ATMs, allowing refugees who fled with bitcoin to cash it back out for fiat currency.""Me sitting in California, I can still send you any amount of money instantly to your phone anytime,"" said Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation, which has been supporting activists in Ukraine since 2009. ""We don't have to worry about the fact that you're a refugee. It doesn't matter that you don't have a Polish passport or a bank account. None of these things matter,"" continued Gladstein."
2022-04-13,"Tether plans to reduce its holdings of commercial debt in its reserves, Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino told CNBC.Tether holds short-term corporate debt but does not disclose from which companies, which has raised transparency concerns.But Ardoino said Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, will cut its holdings of commercial paper further than the current 30% of total reserves. PARIS — Crypto firm Tether is planning to reduce its holdings of commercial debt in its reserves, as the issuer of the world's most-used ""stablecoin"" continues to face questions about what its digital currency is actually backed by.Last year, Tether revealed that it held some cash but also bought a large amount of commercial paper, which is short-term corporate debt. This raised concerns given that Tether does not disclose exactly which companies it holds commercial paper from, and where those entities are based.But the company has been reducing the amount of commercial paper in its reserves. In the fourth quarter of 2021, commercial paper made up just over 30% of Tether's total reserves, down from more than 44% in the third quarter.""Over time we will keep reducing the commercial paper, we aren't finished yet with the reduction,"" Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Tether and affiliated cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, told CNBC on Wednesday at the Paris Blockchain Week Summit.Ardoino said Tether has moved the money from this commercial paper to U.S. Treasurys. A stablecoin is a type of digital currency designed to be pegged to a real world asset such as the U.S. dollar. Their value is not supposed to fluctuate that much, unlike the wild swings seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.Tether issues the USDT token and its market capitalization sits at more than $82 billion. Crypto traders use USDT to trade in an out of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin rather than swapping their money into the fiat version of the U.S. dollar. But there has been controversy over claims made by Tether and its reserves. Last year, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined Tether $41 million for ""making untrue or misleading statements"" that its USDT token was backed 100% by corresponding fiat currencies.Last year, as part of a settlement with the New York Attorney General over a separate case, Tether agreed to provide a breakdown of the assets backing its digital currency.But it has not disclosed the companies whose commercial paper it owns. Tether does disclose the quality ratings of the debt it owns, however.Ardoino pledged further transparency but did not specify what else the company may disclose.""Our journey towards increased transparency is not finished yet,"" Ardoino said."
2022-04-14,"Jack Dorsey's first-ever tweet, which sold as an NFT, or nonfungible token, last year for over $2.9 million, is now only worth thousands of dollars.In March 2021, Jack Dorsey, then-CEO of Twitter, auctioned his first tweet as an NFT on the ""Valuables"" platform run by Cent, a blockchain-powered social media network.The 15 year-old anodyne tweet — ""just setting up my twttr"" — was purchased by crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi for 1,630.58 ether, which was worth an estimated $2.9 million at that time.Last Wednesday, Estavi announced on Twitter that he was selling the NFT on OpenSea, a NFT trading platform, and planning to donate 50% of its proceeds to charity. However, as of the time this story was published, the highest bid for the tweet was worth $9,968, a $2,905,867 drop in value.Estavi, who is the chief executive of blockchain company Bridge Oracle, said on Thursday that he ""may never sell"" the tweet unless he receives a ""high bid"" of an unspecified amount, according to the BBC.  Estavi appears to be taking the drop in value in stride, however. He retweeted a tweet suggesting that ""maybe Elon will buy it"" — a reference to Elon Musk's takeover bid for Twitter, which was announced Thursday morning.Using blockchain technology, NFTs are cryptographic tokens of digital media sold by artists, musicians, celebrities, sports entities and others that can be traded or sold on a decentralized network of computers around the world.The lack of high bids for such a high-profile NFT suggests there are some limits to the NFT market, which exploded in value over the last two years. Trading in nonfungible tokens totaled $17.6 billion last year, an increase of 21,000% from 2020, according to a report from NFT data company Nonfungible.com.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Use this calculator to see how compound interest can help your money grow over time"

PARIS — Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is confident the company will come out well as its lengthy court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nears a conclusion.The San Francisco-based start-up is fighting the SEC over allegations that Ripple, Garlinghouse and executive chairman Chris Larsen engaged in an illegal securities offering through sales of XRP, a cryptocurrency the company both uses commercially and is closely associated with.Ripple has disputed the SEC's findings, arguing XRP should be treated as a virtual currency rather than an investment contract like a stock.""The lawsuit has gone exceedingly well, and much better than I could have hoped when it began about 15 months ago,"" Garlinghouse said at a CNBC-hosted fireside chat at the Paris Blockchain Week Summit Thursday. ""But the wheels of justice move slowly.""The SEC was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.Earlier this week, a judge ruled the SEC cannot edit the contents of emails purporting to show there were conflicts of interest regarding how the watchdog dealt with XRP and other tokens, like ether. Ripple is ""already operating in the worst case scenario,"" having  sold ""zero"" enterprise contracts to financial institutions in the U.S last year. ""We're having record growth,"" he said. ""It's just outside the United States.""Founded in 2012, Ripple touts itself as a blockchain-based alternative to SWIFT, the global interbank messaging system that enables trillions of dollars in payments every day. The company sells its software to banks and fintech companies.Ripple also uses XRP, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market value, to facilitate cross-border transactions. The company owns a majority of the 100 billion XRP tokens in circulation, which it periodically releases from an escrow account to keep prices stable. Garlinghouse said there's a lot at stake if his company does not win the lawsuit.""This case is important, not just for Ripple; it's important for the entire crypto industry in the United States,"" he said. ""It would really be negative for crypto in the United States.""If Ripple loses, most tokens trading on platforms in the U.S. would be deemed securities, Garlinghouse said, meaning those platforms would have to register with the SEC as broker dealers.

PARIS — The crypto world may have turned a corner when it comes to regulation.The bosses of several major crypto companies told CNBC regulators are beginning to take a more positive approach to digital currencies, following a numerous crackdowns targeting the space.Whereas China has banned crypto outright, countries like the U.S. and Britain have announced moves to bring regulatory oversight to the nascent market.""The tide is definitely turning,"" Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, CEO of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, told CNBC on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week Summit.Last year, U.K. regulators barred Binance from undertaking any regulated activity in the country, while in Singapore, Binance limited its services after the central bank warned it may be in violation of local regulation.In a speech kicking off the event Wednesday, Zhao said regulatory discussions around crypto have shifted from ""negative"" to ""positive.""Before Zhao was introduced, the MC for the event referenced the crypto slang term ""wagmi,"" which stands for ""we're all gonna make it.""""To be honest, I feel we kind of did make it,"" he said, adding crypto serves as a lifeline for some in Ukraine amid Russia's invasion.But the crypto world still has some way to go before reaching widespread acceptance. And the fate of the industry largely hinges on the approaches that will be taken by different global regulators. ""The regulatory landscape around the world is coming up to speed quickly,"" Nicolas Cary, co-founder of crypto wallet maker Blockchain.com, told CNBC. The U.K. government last week announced it would bring stablecoins — digital assets that track the prices of existing currencies like the U.S. dollar — into the local payments regime.British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak has also asked the Royal Mint, which is responsible for producing the country's coins, to create a non-fungible token, or NFT, the crypto world's answer to rare collectible items.""The U.K. could be a dark horse in this whole situation,"" Cary told CNBC.""Post-Brexit, they sort of have a policy decision to make and a strategy decision to make,"" he added. ""Do they rebuild Brussels in London, or do they become the Singapore of the West, invite all this innovation, all this technology and all this wealth generation and really own the future of the Web?""Governments want to foster innovation around financial markets and the next possible generation of the internet, known as ""Web3,"" crypto execs told CNBC.But they're also cautious about the dark side of the industry, including money laundering and other illegal transactions, and the impact of energy-intensive bitcoin mining on the environment.In the U.S., President Joe Biden recently signed an executive order urging government-wide coordination on digital assets. A key concern for Western regulators, industry insiders say, is the use of digital assets for Russian sanctions evasion.""I think they're starting to take it seriously [but] I don't think they're getting a warm and fuzzy feeling about it,"" Arthur Breitman, a co-founder of Tezos, a blockchain protocol rivalling Ethereum, told CNBC. ""Naturally, they are going to have a conservative bias,"" Breitman said. However, only a ""tiny fraction"" of crypto payments is related to criminal activity, he added.Illegal activity accounted for less than 0.2% of digital currency transactions in 2021, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. France is ""very progressive and very welcoming towards cryptocurrencies,"" Binance's Zhao told CNBC. ""They are far more advanced in their understanding.""Binance turned on the charm in Paris this week, announcing a ""Web3 and crypto"" start-up accelerator program in partnership with the business incubator Station F.It comes as the company, which has previously boasted about having no official headquarters, is now on the hunt for a global main office.""We will definitely have our regional headquarters for Europe in Paris,"" Zhao said. ""We will establish a number of regional headquarters first before going global."" Binance now has licenses in Bahrain and Dubai, and provisional approval in Abu Dhabi. In Europe, it is supervised by Lithuanian anti-money laundering regulators and is seeking registration with Sweden's financial services watchdog. Not all regulators are on board with the rapid growth of crypto, according to Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of blockchain firm Ripple.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has taken Ripple, Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen to court over allegations they illegally sold over $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency XRP.The SEC contends XRP should be considered a security, a claim that Ripple disputes.""When I give advice to entrepreneurs that are thinking about building a crypto or blockchain company, I tell them do not incorporate in the United States,"" Garlinghouse said. ""The lack of clarity and a lack of certainty means that you are at risk for the exact kind of lawsuit the SEC brought against us.""Ripple is even considering moving its headquarters abroad, with London and Singapore among the potential candidates.""Ripple will hire north of 300 people this year, and more than half of them will be outside the United States,"" Garlinghouse said."

Bridges are an increasingly popular tool in the rapidly-growing world of ""decentralized finance,"" or DeFi.The newly announced sanctions prohibit U.S. individuals and entities from making transactions with the identified ethereum account to make sure the hackers can't ""cash out"" any funds they may hold with American crypto exchanges, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said in a blog post.Chainalysis, another crypto research group, said the attribution to Lazarus highlights the importance of ""how DPRK-affiliated threat actors exploit crypto, and better security for DeFi protocols.""Lazarus, which is believed to be operated by the North Korean state, has been associated with several major cyberattacks over the years, including a 2014 hack on Sony Pictures and the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks.North Korea has attempted to use crypto as a way to evade U.S. sanctions on numerous occasions, according to cybersecurity experts, raising concerns about the possible use of digital assets for Russian sanctions evasion amid the Ukraine war.Earlier this week, Virgil Griffith, a 39-year-old American crypto expert, was sentenced to five years in prison for helping North Korea use virtual currencies to evade sanctions.Proponents of cryptocurrencies say they are an ineffective tool in laundering ill-gotten gains, since activity is recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain.However, criminals have a number of techniques at their disposal to launder crypto, according to Elliptic. The company said internal analysis suggests the Ronin attacks ""managed to launder 18% of their stolen funds"" as of Thursday.Hackers initially swapped stolen USDC tokens for ether through unregulated decentralized exchanges to prevent it from being seized, but then laundered almost $17 million of the proceeds through centralized exchanges like FTX and Huobi.They subsequently used what's known as a ""mixer,"" a service that aims to obscure the trail of funds by mixing streams of potentially identifiable crypto transactions with others. More than $80 million has been sent through this mixing service, called Tornado Cash, according to Elliptic."

2022-04-17,"Crypto experts are hopeful a spot bitcoin ETF could arrive as soon as this year.The optimism comes on the heels of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving an application for the Teucrium Bitcoin Futures ETF earlier this month. The fund was filed under the Securities Act of 1933, instead of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which other future bitcoin funds like Grayscale's Bitcoin Futures ETF have used.""From the SEC standpoint, there were several protections that 40 Act products have that 33 products don't have, but never ever did those protections address the SEC's concern over the underlying bitcoin market and the potential for fraud or manipulation,"" Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" last week.""So the fact that they've now evolved their thinking and approved a 33 Act product with Teucrium really invalidates that argument and talks to the linkage between the bitcoin futures and the underlying bitcoin spot markets that give the futures contracts their value.""Some of the protections include an independent board, accounting and custody rules, he added.""It really is, in our opinion, a matter of when and not if"" there is a bitcoin spot ETF, Sonnenshein said. ""If the SEC can't look at two like issues, the futures ETF and the spot ETF, through the same lens, then it is, in fact, potentially grounds for an Administrative Procedure Act violation.""Grayscale is waiting to hear back from the SEC in early July on a decision that would convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a bitcoin ETF. If they are turned down, Sonnenshein has hinted at suing the agency.While the Grayscale CEO has been one of the loudest SEC's critics, he is not alone.The SEC is objecting on the grounds of manipulation concerns, but its specific request was to demonstrate that regulated CME markets are of significant size, Bitwise Asset Management's Matt Hougan said in the same interview.""Bitcoin is now an institutional market. It's a market with institutional service providers, institutional investors, a large and robust regulated futures market,"" added Hougan, the firm's chief information officer.""We've gotten the bitcoin futures ETF under the 40 Act. We've gotten the bitcoin futures ETF on under the 33 Act.

The demand has also increased for bitcoin products investors can purchase on traditional brokerage platforms, Lydon said in the same panel. Right now, there's not many choices, so it's not going backward, he added.The SEC declined to comment.Disclaimer"
2022-04-17,"For a sense of the economic scale on China's latest Covid lockdowns, look at the numbers on Shanghai.In terms of U.S. states, Shanghai's population is between that of Florida (pop. 21.8 million) and Texas (pop. 29.5 million).Shanghai is home to the world's busiest port, followed by Singapore, according to Bernstein. China's latest wave of Covid restrictions has forced millions of people — roughly three times as many as live in New York City — to stay home and undergo mass virus testing in the metropolis of Shanghai.As Covid cases began to spike in late February, Shanghai tried to control the outbreak with targeted, neighborhood lockdowns. But the city, a center for global transport, manufacturing, finance and trade, decided in late March to implement a two-stage lockdown that soon applied to all districts, generally forcing people not to leave their apartments.Most people outside China know that Shanghai is big, but few realize just how big economically. The following numbers indicate the scale of Shanghai as an economic center — and may hint at the cost of the lockdown. Shanghai's official permanent resident population in 2020 was 24.9 million.That's slightly less than Australia's population of 25.7 million, per the World Bank.But it's only 1.8% of China's 1.41 billion people.In terms of U.S. states, Shanghai is between the size of Florida (pop. 21.8 million) and Texas (pop. 29.5 million).In terms of U.S. cities, Shanghai is three times the size of New York City (pop. 8.3 million) — the largest city in the United States.That means the 280,120 Covid contacts Shanghai has reported as of Thursday for the latest outbreak represent only 1.1% of the city's population. Shanghai's GDP grew by 8.1% in 2021 to 4.32 trillion yuan ($680.31 billion).That GDP is slightly more than Sweden's ($660.92 billion) and less than Poland ($720.35 billion), according to the IMF.But Shanghai's GDP was only 3.8% of China's national GDP of 114.37 trillion yuan in 2021, according to official figures. Shanghai sits at the mouth of the Yangtze River, one of the two main rivers in China.According to Bernstein:Shanghai is home to the world's busiest port, followed by Singapore.Shanghai's Pudong airport is the world's third-busiest cargo airport, behind Memphis, Tennessee, and Hong Kong.In all, Shanghai accounted for 7.3% of China's exports and 14.4% of imports in 2021, according to Citi. According to Citi, Shanghai is China's:Most important semiconductor manufacturing center, home to SMIC, Hua Hong and Universal Scientific Industrial.Home to many auto producers: SAIC Motor, SAIC's joint companies with Volkswagen and GM, Nio, Tesla and Ford.Headquarters or a major center for multinational corporations' China operations: Apple, L'Oreal, Samsung Electronics, P&G, L'Oreal, LVMH, Nike, Panasonic, Philips, Johnson & Johnson and General Electric, among others.Base for ship producers: Jiangnan , Zhonghua and Waigaoqiao shipbuilding. The Shanghai Stock Exchange is the world's third-largest by market capitalization, behind the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq as of the end of 2020, according to World Federation of Exchanges data cited by the exchange.U.S. mutual fund giant Vanguard announced in 2020 a plan to move its Asia headquarters to Shanghai from Hong Kong.Fidelity's China finance business is based in Shanghai, as is American billionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater China operations. In Shanghai, official figures for 2021 show:Average disposable income of 78,027 yuan ($12,288) — more than double the nationwide average of 35,128 yuan ($5,531).Average consumer spending of 48,879 yuan — also double the national average of 24,100 yuan.U.S. wholesale chain Costco chose Shanghai for its first mainland China store in 2019.And as of last year, Shanghai was home to the most coffee shops in the country, with nearly 3 shops per 10,000 people, versus a ratio of about 2 for Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing, according to Meituan.

The southern province of Guangdong is now home to the most foreigners in China, at more than 400,000.The overall number of foreigners in the country rose during those 10 years by about 40% to 1.4 million people — or about 0.1% of China's population."
2022-04-17,"There's real money on the line for the investing club at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey.This year, the Gray Bee Investors club — made up of about 15 high school students — is helping make investing decisions for the Grossman Family Student Investment Fund, which was established through a $100,000 gift to the school from the Grossman Family Foundation.Grossman decided to give the school the money to bolster the personal finance education offered.""Everybody spends money, has checkbooks, debit cards and credit cards but most people don't understand the nuances of saving and investing and having a budget,"" said Steven Grossman, a philanthropist and founder of the Grossman Family Foundation. ""It starts with giving them a very basic education about personal finances and then they can get more into the details of investing.""More from Invest in You:When to up your home-buying budget or stick to your original priceWhy you should start paying off debt now — and how to get startedInflation is costing U.S. households nearly $300 more a monthThe money is currently invested in a broad-based S&P 500 Index fund. The students in the club decide what they'd like to invest in and after a vote, sell off part of the money to buy the assets they suggested.""It's more serious than before, but it's still fun to be learning,"" said Guitze Rodriguez, 17, a senior at St. Benedict's and the chairman of the investing club.Connecting students with alumni working in financeGray Bee Investors was established in 2020 by Mike Scanlan, the dean of administration at St. Benedict's.In the club's first year, during the height of the pandemic, the group met on video calls twice a week to learn the basics of personal finance and investing and meet with a range of alumni volunteers. They also played a stock market game together.Connecting current students with alumni working in finance was one of the benefits of the group meeting virtually, Scanlan said. ""They got to see people who look like them, kids of color, in the investment world,"" he said.St. Benedict's is dedicated to serving students from in and around Newark. Nearly 80% of the student population is Black or Latino, and 88% are on a full or partial scholarship, according to the school's website.Starting with basic money management skills such as budgeting was also important.""[Scanlan] had a good philosophy of teaching us personal finance first before we started investing, even though it was virtual money,"" said Davion Cottrell-Miller, 17, a senior at St. Benedict's and the treasurer of the investing club.Real money at stakeWhen the club was gifted the money, Scanlan decided to take a different approach from stock market investing game.The students had started playing the investing game during the stock market's pandemic dip and so were invested through the record-breaking rally to all-time highs.""They bought in at the lowest part of the market, so all they saw were gains,"" said Scanlan, adding that he and the other advisors worried that the students might think investing was always so easy.Instead of picking stocks this year, Scanlan and the alumni advisors of the club had the students research different sectors that they found interesting, or thought would be a good investment over time. They did the research with the help of students at the Georgetown University Student Investment Fund. Having real money in play made a big difference to the students in the club.""The money has made the investing different, I'm taking it really seriously,"" said Davion Cottrell-Miller, 17, a senior at St. Benedict's and the treasurer of the investing club, adding that working with the Georgetown students made him a better investor.One sector team concluded that the fund should invest in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF because of its expense ratio and past performance. Rodriguez was tasked with presenting to the school's board of finance.""I never in my life thought I'd have a meeting with the finance committee of a school,"" said Rodriguez, adding that it was a great learning opportunity.Now, the group is preparing for the next meeting of the finance committee, where they anticipate they'll be asked more questions about the performance of their investment. The market, and their ETF has had more volatile performance recently due to factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war and chip shortage.""From a portfolio management perspective, I don't like it, but from a teaching perspective, it's great,"" said Scanlan, adding that the club is always talking about investing principles, especially when stocks are down.Going forwardTo be sure, the school does sometimes offer a personal finance class as an elective, but the class is not available this academic year, Scanlan said.Eventually, Scanlan hopes to be able to draw up to 4% annually from the fund and use the money for improvements to the school, which the students will choose, he said.The club may switch from sector investing to putting together a balanced portfolio that would model what a young investor may want in their 401(k) plan, he added.While the club is focused on investing, it also spends a great deal of time going over the basics of personal finance. Ultimately, the goal of the club is to give students a place where they can learn about managing money, as many don't learn those skills at home.""These kids are every bit as ambitious as the kids who hear about this around the dinner table,"" said Scanlan. Still, being in the club has influenced both Rodriguez's and Cottrell-Miller's goals. Rodriguez is now considering a minor in business in college, while Cottrell-Miller wants to switch his intended major to economics from psychology.They're also both dedicated to getting more students involved in the club and helping develop a course to teach younger students about personal finance.Cottrell-Miller could even see himself being an advisor for the Gray Bee Investors one day.""I have to do the same thing and give people like me the opportunity to learn how to invest,"" he said.SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

2022-04-18,"Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang says the Covid stimulus check experiment isn't to blame for record inflation — and he's still all for sending people free cash.Yang says that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can function both as a hedge against inflation, as well as a useful tool in rolling out universal basic income, or UBI. MIAMI — Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang says that Covid stimulus checks are not to blame for the recent inflation spike — and he's still in favor of sending people free cash as a way to insulate workers from economic shocks and technological disruption.The universal basic income (UBI) evangelist told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin Miami conference that stimulus checks comprise ""maybe 17%"" of the money issued with the CARES Act — a measure passed by Congress to unlock trillions of dollars in stimulus funding to shore up the economy amid worldwide lockdowns.""Where did the other 83% of the money go? It went to institutions. It went to pipes,"" said Yang, who ran for New York City mayor and U.S. president on a platform advocating for guaranteed monthly payments from the government to all citizens age 18 to 64, with no strings attached.""Money in people's hands for a couple of months last year — in my mind — was a very, very minor factor, in that most of that money has long since been spent and yet you see inflation continue to rise,"" said Yang, who also pointed out that prior to the pandemic and Economic Impact Payments, the primary drivers of inflation were staples such as education, health care and housing, all of which were independent of stimulus checks.Consumer prices rose 8.5% in March, reflecting increases not seen in the U.S. since 1981. The surge in inflation, according to Yang, has a lot to do with the fact that there aren't enough goods to go around, so people are experiencing pent-up demand.""Everyone is concerned about inflation. I'm concerned about the fact that it's making a lot of Americans' lives miserable, because it's a very difficult circumstance when your expenses are climbing, and maybe your income isn't keeping pace,"" said Yang, who has also said that web3 is the most profound opportunity to fight poverty.The erosion of the dollar's spending power has led some to make the case for bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.""I think that the interest level is going to rise as people do seek alternatives in terms of how to store value,"" Yang said of bitcoin. ""People know if you just have a bank account full of money, unfortunately, that's losing value right now, unless you're getting paid above the rate of inflation, which is, what 7%, nowadays,"" said Yang.""Last I checked, savings accounts were still only paying 1% or 2% max."" Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin aren't just an inflation hedge, according to Yang. They could also help realize his grand vision for widespread UBI roll-out.""The intersection is very significant, because if you're trying to get buying power in people's hands, one tool to do so is the U.S. dollar, and I ran for president on making that case, but there's no reason why it necessarily needs to be in U.S. dollars as opposed to bitcoin, or some other asset class or currency,"" said Yang. He thinks we'll see new currencies emerge from the public sector.""You can have municipalities and communities experimenting with local currencies that will help drive people to local small businesses and nonprofits that may not be getting the support that they need right now,"" he said.Similar to how Beijing is considering attaching expiration dates and other spending rules to its digital yuan (China's central bank digital currency which has been in development since 2014), Yang says a similar model could work well in the U.S.""No one thinks about getting a U.S. dollar, and it's going to expire, or it can only be used in one place and not another. But these are utilities that we should be experimenting with in different settings right now,"" said Yang.During the pandemic, Mark Cuban suggested doing just that: Sending cash cards that can only be used at locally owned small businesses, where the money expires in two weeks, in order to drive activity. Yang says that those are the kinds of things that ""cryptocurrencies very naturally enable that U.S. dollars don't."""
2022-04-18," The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic prompted a financial emergency for many Americans living paycheck to paycheck.Two years later, a similar event would still wreck budgets, a poll finds.Programs to let workers save through employer-provided emergency savings accounts could encourage workers to set aside more cash for unforeseen events. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, many Americans felt the financial shock of a sudden drop in income.If the same kind of event were to happen today, many people would still struggle financially, according to a poll conducted by the Bipartisan Policy Center, Funding Our Future coalition and Morning Consult.What's more, the stopgaps provided by the government — namely stimulus checks and monthly child tax credit payments — are no longer available to help curb financial distress.But one solution — emergency savings plans provided through employers — could help, according to the report.  The survey found 42% of employed Americans feel very or somewhat financially insecure. Moreover, 24% have zero savings set aside for an emergency expense.Notably, the poll does not factor in the 40% of adults who are not employed. If it did, the emergency savings shortfall would likely be even more pronounced.One-third of working adults say they would be very or somewhat uncomfortable with their ability to pay a $400 emergency expense. Moreover, 8% indicated they wouldn't be able to afford it at all.At the same time, 30% of Americans said they could cover a month or less of expenses if their income disappeared.  Those who are more likely to struggle include parents, as well as workers with less than $50,000 in income.Employed adults have struggled in the past 12 months when it comes to paying down debt, which was cited by 47% of respondents. That is followed by paying utilities and telecom bills, 46%; rent or mortgage, 44%; credit cards, 42%; food, 41%; transportation, 31%; clothing, 19%; recreational goods, 15%; student loans, 14%; child care or tuition, 9%; and other, 4%.The online survey was conducted on Feb. 10 and included 1,600 employed adults. About 14% of workers have borrowed or withdrawn money from their retirement accounts in the past year, according to the survey.If employers offered another benefit — emergency savings accounts — that may help employees establish a financial buffer and prevent them from dipping into their long-term investments.Like retirement plans, the emergency savings accounts would be linked to payroll. Workers could choose to set aside an after-tax portion of their paychecks toward their emergency savings funds. Should an unexpected event arise, they would be able to access the money penalty-free. The survey found 60% of employed adults would be interested in this option.Currently, just 21% of workers say their employer offers a workplace emergency savings account.Interest in these potential benefits is particularly high among young, Black and Hispanic workers, as well as parents, according to the research.In fact, the Strengthening Financial Security Through Short-Term Savings Accounts Act that was introduced by Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., last year would address that issue. However, it is unclear whether the proposal will move forward.The proposal calls for a certain percentage of earnings or a fixed amount, as determined by the employer, to be transferred automatically to the savings account each pay period. The accounts would not exceed $10,000, which would be adjusted annually for inflation. "
2022-04-18,"The dollar rose to a fresh two-year high on Monday in thin and choppy trading, in line with higher U.S. Treasury yields, as investors braced for multiple half a percentage-point rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.Volume was light on the day with Hong Kong, European, Australian and New Zealand markets closed for Easter Monday.The U.S. rate futures market has priced in a 96% chance of a 50 basis-point tightening at next month's Fed policy meeting, and about 215 basis points in cumulative rate increases in 2022, providing ample support for the dollar.The greenback also climbed to a new 20-year peak of 126.98 yen versus the Japanese currency, highlighting the contrast in monetary policy between a hawkish Fed and an ultra-dovish Bank of Japan.The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, touched a three-year high of 2.884%.The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against six major currencies, surged to 100.86, the highest since April 2020. It was last up 0.3% at 100.77.""There is indeed history that when the Fed plans for hiking and tightening, the buck ends up losing during those cycles, but at the moment there is little in optimism out there that can knock the buck down,"" said Juan Perez, director of FX trading at Monex USA in Washington.Speculators' net long bets on the U.S. dollar fell for a second straight week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The value of the net long dollar position was $13.22 billion for the week ended April 12.The currency positioning lacked ""a clear sense of narrative for the reduction in U.S. dollar bullish sentiment,"" while a further rise in bearish bets in the Swiss franc and the yen ""reflected the U.S. dollar's yield advantage over these two currencies - whose respective central banks remain far from tightening policy,"" Scotiabank said in a research note.The yen, on the other hand, earlier came off a 20-year low after both Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki voiced concerns about their weakening currency. The rally proved short-lived as the yen hit a fresh 20-year trough in the New York session, and was last up 0.3% at 126.93 yen.""There's growing speculation about FX intervention to save the yen, although that seems unlikely,"" Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at forex broker XM, wrote in a research note. ""Japan would have to intervene alone since the Americans and Europeans wouldn't agree to weaken their own currencies in this inflationary environment, and Japanese authorities haven't even described the moves as 'disorderly' yet to foreshadow action.""Across the Atlantic, the euro, hamstrung by a lack of clarity on when rates in the euro zone would rise, was down 0.3% at $1.0782, just off last week's low of $1.0758, a level unseen since April 2020."
2022-04-19,"The U.S. Secret Service has seized more than $102 million in illicit digital currencies since 2015.In a CNBC interview, the head of the agency's investigations office says cracking a crypto case is often like a ""house of mirrors.""Investigators are finding thieves will transfer stolen bitcoin and other digital currencies into stablecoins.  WASHINGTON — The U.S. Secret Service is cracking down on illicit digital currency transactions, seizing more than $102 million in cryptocurrency from criminals in connection with fraud-related investigations.David Smith, assistant director of investigations, said agents and analysts actively track the flow of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the blockchain, similar to an old-fashioned surveillance. Best known for protecting presidents, the Secret Service also conducts financial and cybercrime investigations.""When you follow a digital currency wallet, it's not different than an email address that has some correlating identifiers,"" Smith said in an interview at the agency's headquarters. ""And once a person and another person make a transaction, and that gets into the blockchain, we have the ability to follow that email address or wallet address, if you will, and trace it through the blockchain."" The seizure of more than $102 million in crypto has occurred in 254 cases since 2015, according to statistics compiled by the agency.Those cases include an investigation with the Romanian National Police in which 900 victims across the U.S. were targeted. That scheme involved posting false ads on popular online auctions and sales websites for luxury items that did not exist, and the delivering of invoices supposedly from reputable companies, making it appear the transactions were real. The perpetrators then engaged in a money-laundering scheme in which victims' funds were converted into digital assets, the Secret Service said.Other cases targeted a Russian cybercrime syndicate that used a crypto exchange to launder funds as well as a ransomware operation tied to Russian and North Korean criminals in which bitcoin payments by U.S. companies to stop the attacks were sent to the suspects' crypto wallets. ""One of the things about cryptocurrency is it moves money at a faster pace than the traditional format,"" Smith said, adding that the quick pace of transactions makes it attractive to both American consumers and criminals. ""What criminals want to do is sort of muddy the waters and make efforts to obfuscate their activities. What we want to do is to track that as quickly as we can, aggressively as we can, in a linear fashion.""Smith was interviewed inside the agency's Global Investigative Operations Center, known as the ""GIOC,"" in which agents and analysts track cryptocurrency transactions worldwide in a secure room at the agency's headquarters. He compared the illicit digital money trail to looking at a ""house of mirrors."" Once the Secret Service pins down the illegal activity, it works to ""dig a little deeper into those transactions and deconstruct [them],"" Smith said. ""You send me something bad on an email, I know there's some criminal activity associated with that email address, I can deconstruct, find whatever tidbits of information that you used when you initially logged in or signed up for that email address.""Investigators are finding thieves will transfer stolen bitcoin and other digital currencies into stablecoins. So, in order to track this activity, they are watching the market. ""Because, you know, the criminals, they're humans too. They want to avoid some of that market volatility associated with some of the major coins,"" he said."
2022-04-19,"Robinhood has agreed to buy Ziglu, a London-based fintech app that allows users to trade bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies.The announcement comes nearly two years after Robinhood halted plans to launch in Britain.Ziglu is one of the few crypto companies that has secured registration with the country's Financial Conduct Authority Robinhood said Tuesday it has agreed to buy Ziglu, a London-based fintech app that allows users to trade bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies. The acquisition will help in its expansion plans in the U.K. and Europe, the company said.The announcement comes nearly two years after Robinhood halted plans to launch in the U.K. At the time, the company said it was prioritizing its business at home over international expansion.Shares of Robinhood climbed more than 5% Tuesday.The deal could provide a crucial boost to growth prospects for Robinhood, whose performance has weakened since the GameStop trading frenzy last year.Robinhood reported a drop in monthly active users in the fourth quarter of 2021 — to 17.3 million from 18.9 million in the previous quarter — and said it expects first-quarter 2022 revenue of less than $340 million, down 35% from the year-earlier period. The company has lost roughly two-thirds of its market value since debuting on the Nasdaq last summer.Vlad Tenev, Robinhood's CEO and co-founder, said the purchase of Ziglu ""will help us accelerate our global expansion efforts.""""Together with the Ziglu team, we'll work to leverage the best of both companies, exploring new ways to innovate and break down barriers for customers across the UK and Europe,"" Tenev said in a blog post.Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, Robinhood said.Founded in 2018, Ziglu allows users to make payments, invest in a range of cryptocurrencies and earn interest on holdings of bitcoin and British pounds sterling.The company has raised a total of £17.5 million ($22.8 million) to date, including £13.4 million from retail investors through the equity crowdfunding platform Seedrs. It was last valued at £85 million.It is one of the few crypto concerns that has managed to register with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority.

LONDON — Seon, a start-up that helps fintech companies like Revolut tackle online fraud, has raised $94 million to develop new tools for preventing sanctions evasion by Russia.The London-based company raised the fresh cash in a funding round led by IVP, the Silicon Valley investment firm that has backed the likes of Netflix and Twitter. IVP Partner Michael Miao has also joined Seon's board.Existing investors Creandum, an early Spotify backer, and PortfoLion, also invested, as did numerous angel investors, including Coinbase Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi and UiPath Chief Executive Daniel Dines.Seon, which counts the likes of Revolut, Afterpay and Nubank as customers, said its technology is designed to make it easier for firms of all stripes to combat fraud.Its software analyzes a consumer's email address, phone number and other data to build up a ""digital footprint,"" and uses machine learning to determine whether they're genuine or suspicious. The firm is now valued at $500 million after its latest funding round, according to two people familiar with the matter, who preferred to remain anonymous discussing private information. Tamas Kadar, Seon's CEO and co-founder, said his company has seen heightened demand for tools that root out transactions from sanctioned individuals and entities and ""politically exposed persons"" amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Part of the cash will be used to address the possible use of fintech apps for money laundering and sanctions evasion.""We are working on an arm to support this need from our client base,"" Kadar told CNBC.Fintechs have come under increased pressure to address Russian sanctions evasion, particularly amid concerns that their controls may be more lax than that of banks. In February, PayPal said it removed more than 4 million accounts after finding they were ""illegitimate."" Seon is also working on a function that will verify businesses online and see if their shareholders are on any sanctions lists.Such tools could identify whether someone is ""just creating shell companies to launder money,"" or ""as a fake identity to hide their assets,"" Kadar said. Seon has ""prioritized this feature to be added in the next quarter,"" he added.Russia's war against Ukraine means ""there has arguably never been a more challenging time for international financial institutions,"" according to Charles Delingpole, CEO of anti-money laundering platform ComplyAdvantage, and an early investor in Seon.""The pandemic saw a rapid shift to online-only activity away from branches, which saw fraudsters gain many more opportunities to perpetuate fraud,"" Delingpole told CNBC. The funds will also go toward helping Seon expand in the United States, as well as Latin America and Asia.""We're going to be scaling up our U.S. team massively,"" Bence Jendruszak, Seon's chief operating officer, told CNBC. ""Online fraud is a major issue in the U.S.""Last year, the company opened new offices in Austin, Texas, and Jakarta, Indonesia, and quadrupled its workforce to 200. Seon expects to roughly double its headcount in the next 12 months.The company says its annual recurring revenue roughly tripled in 2021, while its customer base more than doubled, to 250 from 100.Kadar and Jendruszak founded Seon in Budapest, Hungary, in 2017 after completing their university studies. Kadar has since moved the company's headquarters to the U.K. Seon competes with a number of start-ups, including Israeli firm Riskified and U.S.-based Arkose Labs."

""Tribalism"" around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is holding back the entire $2 trillion market, according to the boss of blockchain firm Ripple.""Polarization isn't healthy in my judgement,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a CNBC-hosted fireside chat at Paris Blockchain Week Summit last week.""I own bitcoin, I own ether, I own some others. I am an absolute believer that this industry is going to continue to thrive.""""All boats can rise,"" Garlinghouse added.Garlinghouse, a former Yahoo executive, compared the crypto industry today to the dotcom era of the late 1990s and early 2000s.""Yahoo could be successful and so could eBay ... They're solving different problems,"" he said. ""There's different use cases and different audiences and different markets. I think a lot of those parallels exist today."" There are now tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, worth a combined $2 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.Some digital coins have attracted quite a dedicated following — not least bitcoin, whose hardcore advocates are often referred to as ""maximalists.""Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor are among the so-called maximalists who support only bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies.Garlinghouse said such maximalism has meant the crypto industry has ""fractured representation"" when it comes to lobbying U.S. lawmakers.Last month, President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. ""The lack of coordination in Washington, D.C., amongst the crypto industry, I find to be shocking,"" he said.Ripple is often linked with XRP, a cryptocurrency the company uses for cross-border payments.The company owns a majority of the 100 billion XRP tokens in circulation, which it periodically releases from an escrow account to keep prices stable.Ripple is in court with the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations that it illegally sold over $1 billion worth of XRP in an unregistered securities offering. The company argues XRP should be considered a virtual currency, not a security."

For the first time ever, the U.S. Department of the Treasury is taking aim at bitcoin miners operating in Russia as the country's war on Ukraine approaches its third month.In its latest round of sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department says that it is taking action against companies in Russia's virtual currency mining industry.According to data from Cambridge University, Russia is the world's third-biggest destination for bitcoin mining.""By operating vast server farms that sell virtual currency mining capacity internationally, these companies help Russia monetize its natural resources,"" Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said in a news release released early Wednesday afternoon.""Russia has a comparative advantage in crypto mining due to energy resources and a cold climate. However, mining companies rely on imported computer equipment and fiat payments, which makes them vulnerable to sanctions,"" continued the statement.The United States views income from the crypto mining industry as a potential threat to the efficacy of its sanctions regime, with the Treasury saying that it is committed to ensuring that no asset becomes a mechanism for the Putin regime to offset the impact of sanctions.Among the companies targeted by U.S. sanctions is BitRiver, which was founded in 2017, and as the name implies, operates its mining farms with hydroelectric power. The mining firm employs over 200 full-time staff in three offices across Russia, according to its website.The Office of Foreign Assets Control has singled out 10 Russia-based subsidiaries of BitRiver in its most recent raft of sanctions on businesses and individuals helping Russia soften the blow of economic penalties.""These US actions should obviously be viewed as interference in the crypto mining industry, unfair competition and an attempt to change the global balance of power in favor of American companies,"" said BitRiver founder and CEO Igor Runets, adding that the company ""has never provided services to Russian government institutions and has not worked with customers already targeted by Washington's sanctions.""The worry is that similar to how Iran reportedly uses bitcoin mining to evade sanctions, Russia could also channel its vast energy resources toward crypto mining operations as a way to circumvent the West's economic blockade.The International Monetary Fund warns in a new report that bitcoin could allow countries such as Russia to monetize energy resources, ""some of which cannot be exported due to sanctions.""The U.S. Congress has voted to ban imports of oil, gas and coal from Russia, while the European Union is considering similar measures, despite the bloc's high level of dependency on Moscow's resources. The EU has proposed banning Russian coal, and oil sanctions are also in the works.The IMF warns that this kind of monetization of energy resources via crypto mining happens ""directly on blockchains and outside the financial system where the sanctions are implemented"" and that miners ""generate revenues directly from users that pay transaction fees to miners,"" which could include sanctioned governments.But keep in mind, the scale of mining operations is dwarfed by the magnitude of sanctions being imposed on Russia by the West.The IMF notes that the share of mining in sanctioned countries is ""relatively contained.""The organization estimates that the monthly average of all bitcoin mining revenues last year was about $1.4 billion, of which Russian miners could have captured close to 11% and Iranian miners 3%."
2022-04-20,"Gavin Wood, founder of blockchain infrastructure company Parity Technologies, coined the term ""Web 3.0"" in 2014, laying out his vision of the future of the internet.For Wood, Web3 is truly decentralized and a more democratic version of the current internet — one that is not dominated by a handful of huge players like Amazon and Microsoft as it is today.Wood said that while cryptocurrencies have become popular, Web3 may not rely heavily on cryptocurrencies. Computer scientist Gavin Wood coined the term ""Web 3.0"" in 2014, laying out his vision for the future of the internet.The phrase, also shortened to ""Web3,"" has become an internet buzzword recently with high-profile technologists, including Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, debating the meaning of the term.Wood, who is one of the co-founders of Ethereum and founder of blockchain infrastructure company Parity Technologies, spoke to CNBC on an episode of the ""Beyond the Valley"" podcast to discuss his Web3 vision. Proponents call Web3 a decentralized version of the internet — one that is not dominated by a handful of powerful players such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Web1 started off with the idea of an open and decentralized internet, but Web2 — the internet we know today — led to the birth of trillion dollar technology companies that have a strong influence over the internet and own a lot of the infrastructure the web is built on.""The big problem with this is ... sort of the same thing as placing all your eggs in one basket, if something goes wrong with one of these services, you know, the service is suddenly unavailable for an awful lot of people,"" Wood told CNBC's ""Beyond the Valley"" podcast.""Furthermore, the keyword here is trust. We're having to trust the people behind the services. We're having to trust the owners of the companies that run the service ... And so yeah, we kind of managed to architect ourselves into this, somewhat like dystopian version of what the world could be."" For Wood, Web3 is truly decentralized and a more democratic version of the current internet.""Web3 is really sort of an alternative vision of the web, where the services that we use are not hosted by a single service provider company, but rather they're sort of purely algorithmic things that are, in some sense, hosted by everybody. So it's like, it's very peer to peer, right? ... The idea being that all participants sort of contribute a small slice of the ultimate service,"" Wood said.""And thus, no one really has any advantage over anyone else ... not in the same sense, at least as, as you know, when you, for example, go to Amazon or you go to eBay or Facebook, where the company behind the service really has absolute power over what it is that they do in providing the service."" Blockchain is a key technology behind Web3. It is most-often associated with the cryptocurrency bitcoin and is the technology that underpins it. The bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger of activity of the bitcoin network. But bitcoin is not owned by a single company or person and it is not issued by a central authority like a central bank. Instead, it is decentralized and the network is maintained by a global group of people running specialized computers.So blockchain is a key technology and decentralization an important phrase.Web3 is based on the idea of a ""trustless"" model. Right now, we have to trust companies to deliver the service they promise. But if Web3 products and services are built on blockchains and are decentralized then you'd only have to trust the underlying algorithm to deliver that product.That carries its own risks of course. Wood gave the example of a Web3 version of Twitter which he said would give more users control over their posts and make verifying identities easier, for example.""So it's much harder for someone to like, fake my identity, because we have ... cryptographic-based proofs that I have done this, and only I could possibly have done this,"" Wood said.""We have probably elements of sort of greater, like freedom of speech ... in the sense that the system isn't going to inherently have gatekeepers that in the same way that you know, there are Twitter employees that act effectively as gatekeepers to the system."" Web3 advocates suggest cryptocurrencies will play a key role in the future of the internet. An example could be where there is a Web3 application that runs on a certain blockchain that uses a specific digital coin.For example, services that run on the Ethereum blockchain may require ether-based digital tokens.

But Wood said that Web3 the way he envisions it, may not rely heavily on cryptocurrencies.""I suspect that currency will continue to play a role in services. But I think ... overall, we're going to start seeing services be delivered without the need to use tokens,"" Wood told CNBC.""And I think that's going to be a big jump. And I think it is one of the key factors that's going to open the door to the mainstream,"" he added, suggesting most people probably won't want to buy lots of different tokens to use a service. Bitcoin itself has never been regulated because it's very difficult to do given the fact it is not owned by a single entity. However, businesses that touch cryptocurrency in some way, such as exchanges, often find themselves under some sort of regulation.So if a Web3 service is built on the same theory of decentralization as bitcoin, how will regulators approach it?For now, countries around the world are still trying to figure out how best to regulate cryptocurrencies and related technologies. Web3 is a part of that conversation.Wood suggests it will be difficult for authorities to regulate the Web3 services themselves. Instead, it could be in an app's ""own self interest"" in terms of their product to bring in rules that align with regulators, Wood said.He added that regulators might look to regulate the ""users of the service rather than the service itself."" Web3 advocates suggest that with Web3, the power of technology giants could be challenged.However, those same companies like Microsoft and Twitter are also investing in Web3.Wood said it will be ""hard to make a dent ... in these Goliaths"" but he likened their potential plight to Microsoft in the late 2000s and into the coming years.""It didn't matter that you were running the Windows operating system, or authoring your document in Microsoft Word ... we use the web as a platform, and the web could be used on any operating system,"" Wood said.""Ultimately ... I would hope that Web3, fulfils the needs of the future in a way that can never really be fulfilled by these centralized service providers,"" he added."

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance removed and redesigned an emoji on Twitter, after outcry from users who pointed out it looked like a swastika.Twitter sometimes lets brands design their own custom emojis to include in hashtags in order to promote their business. In this case, Binance launched an emoji for several hashtags, including #Binance, #BNB and #BitcoinButton.The associated emoji for these hashtags depicted a block with Binance's logo surrounded by four pixelated arms each bent at a right angle, similar to the swastika symbol.Twitter users were quick to pick up on its resemblance to a swastika. ""The new Binance logo is a literal swastika emoji,"" one user wrote.Other users highlighted the significance of the day Binance chose to launch the emoji: Apr. 20, Adolf Hitler's birthday.The Binance symbol wasn't tilted, suggesting it may have been inspired by Asian symbolism — it is used to represent spirituality in the Hindu and Buddhist religions — rather than the emblem of the German Nazi party which was abolished in 1945.Binance has since removed the emoji and replaced it with a new one that looks more like a coin.""Well that was obviously really embarrassing,"" the company wrote on Twitter.""We're not sure how that emoji got through several layers of review without anyone noticing, but we immediately flagged the issue, pulled it down, and the new emoji design is being rolled out as we speak,"" Binance said.Founded in 2017 by Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur Changpeng Zhao, Binance is the world's largest digital currency exchange, handling more than $18 billion in trading volumes in a single day, according to CoinGecko data."
2022-04-21,"MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor says the company doubles as the first and only bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S.""We're kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF,"" Saylor told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami.So far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has only approved ETFs that track contracts speculating on the future price of bitcoin, instead of the cryptocurrency itself. The commission has refused to greenlight any of the formal applications for a pure-play bitcoin-based ETF MIAMI — MicroStrategy may technically be in the business of enterprise software and cloud-based services, but CEO Michael Saylor says the publicly traded company doubles as the first and only bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S.""We're kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF,"" Saylor told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami.So far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has only approved ETFs that track contracts speculating on the future price of bitcoin, instead of the cryptocurrency itself. The commission has refused to greenlight any of the formal applications for a pure-play bitcoin-based ETF — a financial instrument that would give investors the chance to invest in bitcoin without having to go through the motions of signing up for an exchange, opening a crypto wallet, or dealing with any of the other logistics involved with buying and holding bitcoin.""If there was a spot ETF, you'd be paying a 1% fee, and it wouldn't be leveraged. With MicroStrategy, we have a software company that generates cash flow, so we convert our cash flows into bitcoin,"" continued Saylor, who says the de facto MicroStrategy bitcoin spot ETF generates a 4% to 5% tax-deferred yield.MicroStrategy, which was launched by Saylor in 1989, has been adding bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet for the last two years. The company has now spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700.Saylor doesn't have any plans to stop buying bitcoin, which will only further grow MicroStrategy's exposure to the digital asset.""Why would we ever stop?"" he said.""As we generate cash flows, we think that the responsible thing to do for our shareholders is we convert currency which is devaluing, into an asset which is appreciating,"" said Saylor, who also noted that MicroStrategy is not diversifying because he feels the company owes shareholders a consistent strategy.""If you want to be 2% exposed to bitcoin, you'd put 2% of your portfolio into MicroStrategy, and the other 98% of your portfolio, you can invest in whatever you want. They don't want the CEO of a publicly traded company to be unpredictable and random."" When MicroStrategy first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in August 2020, it was a pretty unpopular thing to do.This was back at the tail end of the crypto winter when the coin was trading in the low $11,000 range, and many institutional investors and big Wall Street banks remained bearish on digital assets.But Saylor's move soon proved prescient.As bitcoin's upswing began in earnest in October 2020, old-school, billionaire hedge fund managers like Stanley Druckenmiller reversed course and began buying bitcoin. Major companies like Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and insurer MassMutual also followed suit, plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into bitcoin.This kind of mainstream adoption is hugely important, because cryptocurrencies like bitcoin aren't backed by an asset, nor do they have the full faith and backing of the government. They're valuable, in part, because people believe they're valuable. So it goes a long way when bitcoin gets buy-in from some of the biggest names on Wall Street. Saylor's evangelism of bitcoin has helped to make him an A-lister in the community. Throughout the Bitcoin 2022 conference, Saylor would traverse the Miami Beach Convention Center trailed by an entourage of fans, vying for a selfie with him.Blue chip CEOs also look to the MicroStrategy CEO for a how-to on corporate adoption.MicroStrategy has used company debt to purchase bitcoin, and in March, Saylor decided to take another step toward normalizing bitcoin-backed finance when he borrowed $205 million using his bitcoin as collateral — to then buy more of the cryptocurrency.""We have $5 billion in collateral. We borrowed $200 million. So I'm not telling people to go out and take a highly leveraged loan. What I am doing, I think, is doing my best to lead the way and to normalize the bitcoin-backed financing industry,"" said Saylor, who added that publicly traded crypto miner Marathon Digital also took out a credit line with Silvergate Bank.""As people realize they can borrow against something, then they realize they never have to sell it, and then they start to stretch their time horizon from — 'It's a 36-month speculation,' to — 'It's a 36-year holding,'"" Saylor told CNBC."

2022-04-22,"A group of House democrats want the Environmental Protection Agency to look into the environmental effects of crypto mining, citing ""serious concerns"" about pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.Two dozen legislators, led by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), sent a letter to the EPA this week asking the regulatory body to make sure mining companies were in compliance with the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.""We have serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions,"" the letter reads.The lawmakers say that the ""rapidly expanding"" cryptocurrency industry must be monitored, and criticized digital tokens that require proof of work (PoW) to authorize transactions, which involves miners using power-intensive computers to solve complex puzzles.The letter complains about the ""massive server farms"" used in PoW mining, saying that the use of specialized computing hardware creates ""major electronic waste challenges.""""Millions of devices quickly become obsolete, leading to large amounts of electronic waste,"" the letter said, citing estimates that bitcoin mining alone produces 30,700 tons of electronic waste annually. ""The industry needs to be held accountable for this waste and discouraged from creating it.""In addition to evaluating mining companies to ensure they are in compliance with environmental laws, the letter requests that the EPA engage with the communities where the server farms are located when reviewing permits to ""ensure communities are not left with the toxic burdens associated with this technology.""A representative for the EPA did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Elon Musk says Tesla's humanoid Optimus robot 'will be worth more than the car business'"
2022-04-22,"U.S. officials are concerned Russia will ""monetize its natural resources"" for power-intensive crypto mining to evade sanctions.The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control targeted Russian bitcoin miner BitRiver in its latest round of sanctions.Russia is the world's third-biggest bitcoin mining hub, according to Cambridge University data. Sanctions imposed on Russia over the country's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine could hamper the growth of its multibillion-dollar crypto sector, according to experts.This week, U.S. officials targeted Russian bitcoin mining firm BitRiver in its latest round of sanctions aimed at hurting Russia's economy. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control says it is concerned Russia may monetize its vast oil reserves and other natural resources with power-intensive crypto mining as a way to raise funds and get around western sanctions.""This is a powerful signal from OFAC that it will use every tool in its arsenal to prevent Russia from evading sanctions through crypto,"" David Carlisle, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at crypto compliance firm Elliptic, said in an emailed note.The sanctions will cripple BitRiver and its various subsidiaries, blocking them from accessing U.S. crypto exchanges or mining equipment. Crypto mining — the process of validating new digital currency transactions — requires specialized computers that consume lots of energy.The move shows U.S. officials are ""deeply concerned that Russia could leverage its natural resources to conduct crypto mining to evade sanctions,"" something Iran and North Korea have been known to engage in the past, Carlisle said.The potential exploitation of bitcoin production for Russian sanctions evasion remains a key concern for global regulators, including the International Monetary Fund. ""Crypto mining, while nowhere near a replacement for the assets frozen by Russian sanctions, avoids the fiat-to-crypto 'on-ramps' and crypto-to-fiat 'off-ramps' at centralized virtual currency exchanges, thereby bypassing sanctions screening,"" said Anand Sithian, counsel at Crowell & Moring and a former trial attorney in the criminal division of the Department of Justice's asset forfeiture and money-laundering section. Separately, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, said it is limiting its service for Russian users in response to the fifth wave of EU sanctions on Moscow.Russian Binance accounts with over 10,000 euros in digital currency will be prevented from making deposits or trades and can only withdraw funds, the company said.""While these measures are potentially restrictive to normal Russian citizens, Binance must continue to lead the industry in implementing these sanctions,"" Binance said in an update on its website. ""We believe all other major exchanges must follow the same rules soon.""Russia is home to a huge cryptocurrency market. The Kremlin estimates that Russians own roughly 10 trillion rubles ($124 billion) worth of digital assets.It's not clear where this data comes from, but there is growing evidence that Russians are turning to crypto as an alternative to the ruble as the currency crashes in response to the country's economic isolation.According to data from CryptoCompare, ruble-denominated crypto trading volumes reached 111.4 billion rubles ($1.4 billion) in March, much higher than in earlier months.   Activity has dipped in April, with total month-to-date volume reaching only 19.2 billion rubles. Binance was the most popular exchange for ruble-crypto volume in March, accounting for 77% of trades.   In the six months ending March 2022, ruble-crypto trading volume topped 420 billion rubles, or more than $5 billion, according to CryptoCompare. Meanwhile, Cambridge University figures show the country is a powerhouse in the field of crypto mining.In August 2021, Russia accounted for about 11% of the global processing power used for minting new units of bitcoin, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, making it the third-biggest mining hub behind Kazakhstan.Given Kazakhstan's political unrest led to internet shutdowns that knocked bitcoin miners offline, there's a chance Russia's share of the sector may be even higher now.However, there could end up being an exodus of miners from Russia to the ""stans"" — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan — where they may ""utilize stranded gas to power their operations,"" Charles Hayter, CEO of CryptoCompare, told CNBC.The Russian government has a ""love-hate relationship"" with digital assets, Hayter said. While Russia's central bank is pushing for a ban on the use and mining of cryptocurrencies, President Vladimir Putin wants to regulate them instead.According to Hayter, the Russian regime and its oligarchs ""might see digital assets as a way to fund activities outside of Russia."""
2022-04-22," Online payments firm Stripe says it will start offering merchants the ability to pay their users in cryptocurrency through the stablecoin USDC.Starting Friday, Twitter will let a certain number of creators receive their earnings from its paid Ticketed Spaces and Super Follows features in crypto.It's Stripe's first significant push into crypto since dropping support for bitcoin four years ago. Stripe will allow businesses to pay their users via cryptocurrencies, starting with Twitter, in the latest sign of how large financial firms are warming to digital assets.The $95 billion online payments company said Friday it will start offering merchants the ability to make payouts in crypto through the stablecoin USDC, which is issued by crypto firm Circle. Stablecoins are tokens that are pegged to fiat currencies to maintain a stable price. In USDC's case, as the name suggests, the cryptocurrency is backed by the U.S. dollar.Twitter will be the first company to integrate the new payment method. Starting Friday, the social media platform — which has been the subject of much talk lately over a potential takeover by Tesla CEO Elon Musk — will let a certain number of creators receive their earnings from its paid Ticketed Spaces and Super Follows features in USDC.It's Stripe's first significant push into crypto since dropping support for bitcoin four years ago. The San Francisco-based start-up stopped accepting payments via bitcoin in January 2018, citing the digital coin's notoriety for volatile price swings and a lack of efficiency in making everyday transactions. But the firm has since warmed to crypto amid hype over ""Web3,"" a movement in tech that calls for the creation of a decentralized version of the internet based on blockchain technology. Stripe last year formed a team dedicated to exploring crypto and Web3. In November, Stripe co-founder John Collison hinted the firm may soon offer crypto support again.""While the 'store of value' aspects of cryptocurrencies typically receive the most attention, we view the prospect of 'open-access global financial rails' as being at least equally compelling,"" Karan Sharma, product manager at Stripe's crypto unit, said in a blogpost Friday. ""As a result, we've been exploring ways to use cryptocurrency-based platforms to unlock broader access.""The company's crypto payouts feature will run on the Polygon network, a so-called ""Layer 2"" solution that sits on top of the Ethereum network to handle transactions faster and at a lower cost. Bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies have faced criticism over sluggish transaction times and high fees.""We plan to add support for additional rails and payout currencies over time,"" Sharma said.Stripe isn't the only company opening up its platform to digital currencies — in fact, the company is arguably late to the party. Visa, Mastercard and PayPal and other major payment processors have all announced moves of their own in the space. That was back when digital currency prices were still rising.More recently, several major cryptocurrencies have slumped sharply from record highs, with bitcoin, the world's largest, down more than 40% from a November peak of nearly $69,000. Bitcoin was trading at around $39,724 on Friday, according to Coin Metrics data, off by about 6% in the last 24 hours."

""I just like to look at where I can get some good arbitrage advantage, and I thought bitcoin mining presented that both from just, 'Hey, I could get more bitcoin by having miners than buying bitcoin, especially at the scale that I can get into it — but also, that I am a big believer in bitcoin's future.'""Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work mining model, meaning that miners around the world run high-powered computers to simultaneously create new bitcoin and to validate transactions. The process requires expensive equipment, some technical know-how, and a lot of electricity. Taing decided to outsource most of that work by enlisting the help of Compass Mining, a service that hosts, supplies, and operates mining rigs for retail miners who don't want to deal with the logistics of physically handling mining equipment themselves.So far, the experiment is working out pretty well, according to Taing. Of his 261 mining rigs, which include Canaan AvalonMiners, Bitmain Antminer S19 Pros, and Whatsminer M30Ss, 200 are hosted through Compass in Nebraska and Canada. They generate about 2.8 bitcoin a month, or about $111,000, according to digital receipts he provided CNBC.Taing also earns income buying and selling mining hardware to retail customers on Compass' marketplace. They typically buy one or two at a time and are not as price sensitive.CNBC spoke to multiple Compass customers to better understand the appetite for small-scale mining as they increasingly compete with major industry players with massive operations. But Compass CEO Whit Gibbs says that's exactly the point: To capture market share for retail miners and put the network into the hands of the people.""It will effectively give small miners a substantial share of bitcoin's network hashrate, which has ultimately, always been our goal,"" said Gibbs. ""We want to get 5% of the network being controlled by retail miners, and then move that up to 10% to 15% in the coming years.""Gibbs says he's noticed a lot of people who would normally invest in real estate are instead bringing those dollars to mining, because they're able to see a faster return on mining than they would if they were buying a rental property, especially as private equity steps in to buy houses and drive up prices. Compass clients range from self-proclaimed ""plebs,"" who stack the smallest denomination of bitcoin known as satoshis, or ""sats,"" to billionaire bitcoiner Jack Dorsey.One of those plebs is Jon McClellan, a Texas based lobbyist for AT&T. He currently has a single bitcoin miner with Compass in Oklahoma, which he purchased at the end of 2020. For him, the desire to mine is part ideological, part financial.""I wanted to do my part to secure the the bitcoin network — have my own hashrate, under my own power,"" said McClellan, referring to his share of the collective computing power of miners worldwide.""I knew that if I buy a miner, I'll be literally buying bitcoin every day, every minute, every second, every hour, regardless of what's going on in my life, budget-wise,"" continued McClellan, who calls the process an ""easy way to dollar cost average into bitcoin.""McClellan says Compass was the only retail mining company that seemed accessible for the average person. Compass Mining allows customers to buy (new or used) mining machines for between $4,500 and $25,800 on their website, then locates them in partner data centers and takes care of the physical logistics and subsequent maintenance.The return on investment for personal mining varies based on a few key factors, including the upfront cost of buying gear, the number of mining machines you're running, the cost of electricity and hosting, plus pool fees, which allow a single miner to combine their hashing power with thousands of other miners all over the world to increase their chances of earning bitcoin.McClellan, who took out a bitcoin-backed loan of $10,000 through Coinbase at an 8% interest rate to buy his single miner, says that his ROI is about two years. He is currently pulling in around $400 a month, though he has to pay $150 for hosting fees, so he nets about $250. But McClellan has plans to scale up his operation this year in Texas, Oklahoma, or Wyoming, since all three states are favorable to the bitcoin mining industry.Taing says he has about 18 months until he achieves ROI with profit margins of around 65% to 70% to cover operating expenses. Unlike other customers, however, Taing has a special rate of 0% for pool fees through Foundry.Gibbs, the Compass CEO, says their customer base is mostly retail, which he defines as miners who buy one to five machines, investing somewhere between $10,000 and $50,000.""That's really where the majority of our business has been over the last six months,"" said Gibbs, though he notes that Compass is beginning to serve more institutional clients.Nevin Bannister, for example, is using Compass to build out a large-scale bitcoin mining operation in hopes of taking it to the public market.""They make it really simple,"" said Bannister. ""They are a great turnkey option. They help you buy the machines, they plug them in for you, they maintain all the operations.""So far, Bannister has bought 6,000 rigs, 1,500 of which are operational. Most are housed in Oklahoma, and they have just under a hundred in Canada.While Bannister wouldn't disclose his monthly revenue, he did tell CNBC that each rig should produce about .015 bitcoin a month. At 1,500 rigs, that hypothetically produces 270 bitcoin a year, or $10.7 million.""I'm a serial entrepreneur. I've had several companies that I've sold, and I just love learning new things,"" continued Bannister, who says on his LinkedIn page that he has founded start-ups that have sold for a combined value of over $800 million. ""This is like getting into the internet in the early days.""Ultimately, Gibbs thinks that institutional buyers like Bannister will be a good thing for the smaller-scale miners, because their investment will help to bring down costs overall and make more space available to retail clients. Jack Dorsey's payments company Block (formerly Square) is also looking to make it easier for the little guy to start mining for bitcoin.In a string of tweets earlier this year, Block's general manager for hardware, Thomas Templeton, laid out the company's plans for next steps.Templeton says the goal is to make bitcoin mining — the process of creating new bitcoins by solving increasingly complex computational problems — more distributed and efficient in every way, ""from buying, to set up, to maintenance, to mining.""Toward that end, the company is solving one major barrier to entry: Mining rigs are hard to find, expensive, and delivery can be unpredictable. Block says it is open to making a new ASIC, which is the specialized gear used to mine for bitcoin. Templeton writes that Block is also looking to improve reliability and the user experience of mining.""Common issues we've heard with current systems are around heat dissipation and dust. They also become non-functional almost every day, which requires a time-consuming reboot. We want to build something that just works,"" Templeton tweeted. ""They're also very noisy, which makes them too loud for home use.""Democratizing access to bitcoin mining is a big part of the mission statement of this project.""Mining isn't accessible to everyone,"" wrote Dorsey in October, just a few months after the U.S. eclipsed China for the first time ever as the world's top destination for bitcoin miners. ""Bitcoin mining should be as easy as plugging a rig into a power source. There isn't enough incentive today for individuals to overcome the complexity of running a miner for themselves.""Gibbs says he welcomes another player into the retail bitcoin mining space.""It's going to be massively beneficial to bitcoin and ultimately, to us as well,"" Gibbs told CNBC.""My understanding of what they're putting out is going to be more of a home-based, low power consumption, probably more of a low-yield product, but it will get people that first taste of bitcoin mining,"" continued Gibbs. He assumes that as individuals get the bug to grow their hashrate they'll look at Compass or rival River Financial to expand their operation.""I really do think that along the lines of Jack's mission in general, he wants to get mass adoption for bitcoin, and he's gonna throw dollars behind anything that he thinks is going to get more people paying attention to it,"" said Gibbs.WATCH: Texas crypto miners power down to ease grid pressure"
2022-04-23,"After two years of pandemic challenges, the Golden State Warriors have resumed a plan to become the most valuable sports franchise in the world. The Warriors are valued at more than $5 billion, up from a $3.5 billion value before the pandemic, and projected to eclipse $700 million in revenue this year, according to people familiar with the team's financials. The club has a plan for driving growth that includes new and innovative cash streams.  The Golden State Warriors are getting back to business. After two years of pandemic challenges, the NBA franchise has resumed its plan to become the most valuable sports franchise in the world. The Warriors are valued at more than $5 billion, up from a $3.5 billion value before the pandemic, and projected to eclipse $700 million in revenue this year, according to people familiar with the team's financials. The club has a plan for driving growth that includes a new cash stream in the recently launched Golden State Entertainment division. The venture follows similar efforts in rolling out an in-house ticket exchange, a partnership with a cryptocurrency company, and leveraging the blockchain sector to cash in on NFTs, or non-fungible tokens.All just two years after the Warriors moved into the $1.4 billion Chase Center in San Francisco, where the team monetizes surrounding real estate and maintains a tenant and equity partner in Uber.The team's President and Chief Operating Officer, Brandon Schneider, says the projects are key to becoming a force off the basketball court like it is on. ""Disney started as a theme park,"" Schneider told CNBC. ""The Warriors started as a basketball team. Look at what Disney has become, and look at what the Warriors are becoming.""Schneider spoke to CNBC on April 14, a day removed from his first anniversary of being announced Warriors president. He took over the position from longtime executive Rick Welts who retired last year.He said the Warriors goal is to transform into ""global leaders in experiences and entertainment."" And he added the organization would ""leverage the strength of the brand"" and innovate around technology ""because we're in the Bay Area, the technology epicenter of the world."" If the Warriors' strategy pans out, it could position the team to surpass the New York Knicks as the most valuable NBA franchise.The Knicks are valued at $5.8 billion and ranked third on Forbes' most valuable sports team list behind the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, worth $6.5 billion, and MLB's New York Yankees, worth $6 billion. The Warriors rank sixth. ""With the trajectory that they are on, and the effort that they put into the franchise, that wouldn't surprise me,"" said sports valuation expert Bryce Erickson, a senior vice president at advisory firm Mercer Capital. ""I certainly think it's possible.""Sports valuations are often inflated and largely hypothetical — barring formal and public sales. Pundits use multiples of revenue and add in operating income, adjusted for revenue sharing, and any other assets tied to the club that could include real estate to arrive at a number. But lofty valuations aside, the Warriors are already edging out their competition: In 2021, the Warriors led the NBA in basketball-related revenue with $474 million in 2021, according to Forbes. Meanwhile, the Knicks' revenue dropped to $421 million from $472 million, likely the result of pandemic-related losses. Add in revenue from other events at Chase Center and the Warrior's other nascent revenue streams, and the team's revenue stacks up much higher.  Andrew Lustgarten, president and chief executive of Madison Square Garden Sports – the holding company behind the Knicks – said the company is eyeing sports gambling as an opportunity to drive revenue. The team struck deals with Caesars and MGM after New York cleared sports gambling. California has yet to legalize the practice.""MSG Sports has numerous growth opportunities across its businesses and brands,"" Lustgarten said in a statement to CNBC. ""The Knicks portfolio has tremendous upside in a number of key areas, including ticketing, premium hospitality, our jersey patch sponsorship, expansion of sponsorships in international markets, and our new mobile sports betting and crypto partnerships.""Erickson said ""locational benefits and market size benefits"" could help the Warriors take on the Knicks in revenue. He referenced the HBO series ""Winning Time,"" which chronicles the Los Angeles Lakers' rise to prominence in the 1980s on the back of innovation.""Things change,"" Erickson said. ""Prior to (Jerry Buss) buying the team, what were the Lakers? They were a struggling franchise in a struggling league. And their timing was impeccable. So, whose to say that more than 40 years later, the Warriors can't have the same effect? There's nothing there to say they couldn't, particularly from an economic vantage point.""Asked if the Warriors are aiming for the top valuation spot in sports, a humbled Schneider downplayed the mission.""We think a lot bigger than that,"" he said. ""I understand why people focus on that and why it's interesting, but (owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber) – they're never going to sell the Warriors. So in terms of what a third-party wants to value our organization, that's not our focus."" The Warriors' new GSE division is expected to create in-house content in a partnership with Mandalay Entertainment, a company founded by Guber. GSE will produce documentaries, release a new single featuring K-pop star BamBam, and explore music festivals.But most importantly, GSE aligns the Warriors with future licensing revenue from streaming giants like Apple, which this year welcomed sports content onto its platform, and Netflix, which will need to get creative to solve a subscriber issue.""We've been in the content business for many years,"" said Schneider. The Warriors already help the NBA break TV viewership records. ""We're thinking a lot about direct-to-consumer."" In February 2022 the Warriors launched SuiteXchange, a ticket exchange platform for luxury suites inside the Chase Center. It leverages blockchain technology and allows the team to capture data and transaction fees.""We think Suite Exchange can become the Stub Hub or Ticketmaster of suites,"" said Schneider. ""This is just scratching the surface.""Schneider said the Warriors are in discussions with other clubs to use the service but didn't reveal the teams due to privacy concerns.""This is just the beginning of the beginning,"" said Schneider, referring to a motto used by the team's owners. ""That's become a mantra for us.""The team has also surpassed $2 million in NFT sales and, earlier this month, deepened its partnership with crypto platform FTX, which agreed to a $10 million global sponsorship deal with the club back in December.FTX unveiled a collection that features 3,000 NFTs, one of which includes two tickets to every home playoff game. The NFTs sell for $499 each. Schneider said as long as the Warriors get creative and include ""the right experiences, the revenue comes."" Under Welts' 11-year tenure, the Warriors surpassed the Los Angeles Lakers as the second-most valuable team in the NBA.Welts said at least some of that success is due to franchise star Stephen Curry, who has led the Warriors to three championships since 2015 and become the face of the NBA.""When your best player is not only the athlete and talent that he is but also the person that he is, you've got a heck of a head start in trying to create something special,"" Welts told CNBC in 2019.Schneider has vowed the organization would protect and continue to enhance its main attraction – the basketball team.The Warriors have the highest payroll in the NBA, spending more than $180 million on its 2021-22 roster as it seeks a fourth NBA title in the last eight years. The club welcomed back co-franchise star Klay Thompson this season. Draymond Green is still wreaking havoc. And it appears the Warriors have a rising star in Jordan Poole.In 2021, the Warriors agreed to a four-year extension with Curry. The deal starts next season and pays the 34-year-old an average annual value, or AAV, of $53 million per season, according to Spotrac, a website that tracks sports contracts.""We have a plan and want to be consistently good, want to invest,"" said Schneider. ""And we're lucky to have the ownership group that's willing to invest so much in what we do on the court and off the court. That's critical and gives us a competitive advantage.""And with Curry locked in, the team's jersey patch media asset could be on the verge of breaking another NBA sponsorship record.The Warriors' deal with e-commerce company Rakuten expires in 2023 and reportedly pays the team roughly $20 million annually. It's unclear what the Warriors are seeking for a renewal price but for comparison, the Brooklyn Nets landed a league-high $30 million-per-year deal for its patch in 2021 with online trading platform WeBull.Asked where the Warriors want to be in 2030, Schneider said, ""Winning championships, doing great things in the community and continue to grow our global fanbase.""""When we were building Chase Center, we talked about transforming into a sports and entertainment company that happened to have a pretty good basketball team as the centerpiece,"" he said.

2022-04-25,"The price of dogecoin popped on Monday afternoon following news that Twitter has accepted Elon Musk's buyout deal.The meme cryptocurrency jumped as much as about 27% after the announcement that Twitter will be purchased by an entity owned by the Tesla CEO.Dogecoin was last up 24.3%. Meanwhile, Twitter shares ended the day 5.6% higher.Dogecoin, the original meme asset, is based on the 2013 Internet meme doge and was created in jest in the same year. It gained some relevance last year after the Tesla CEO endorsed it and continued hyping the cryptocurrency on social media.Around that time, Musk became something of a cryptocurrency market mover with his tweets about dogecoin and bitcoin. In May of last year, his posts fueled dogecoin's rally to its all-time high of 67 cents, per Coin Metrics.Twitter's former CEO and co-founder, Jack Dorsey, stepped away from the company in November to focus on efforts at his payments company, which has since rebranded to Block (from Square) to reflect broader ambitions in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.In addition to being a dogecoin influencer, Musk's Tesla is one of the biggest corporate buyers of bitcoin. Those who hope to see Twitter integrate more crypto native features will be keeping an eye on whether or how Musk prioritizes crypto. Bitcoin's censorship-resistant nature on the surface aligns with Musk's vision for a free speech utopia.""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk said in a statement Monday."
2022-04-25,"Kraken will open an office in Abu Dhabi and become the first exchange to offer UAE dirham trading after receiving a full license to operate in the country, Curtis Ting, Kraken’s managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told CNBC.A sense of “greater regulatory clarity” is the reason for the influx of cryptocurrency businesses in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, according to Citi.The Middle East is one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets in the world, making up 7% of global trading volumes, according to Chainalysis.  ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is expanding into the Middle East and will open its regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi after receiving a full license to operate a regulated trading platform in the UAE.""We're incredibly excited to be able to set up our operations right in the ADGM [Abu Dhabi Global Market] itself to operate a virtual asset platform that finally offers Dirham pairs for investors in the region,"" Curtis Ting, Kraken's managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told CNBC's Dan Murphy.Kraken will become the first cryptocurrency exchange to offer direct funding and trading in UAE dirhams against bitcoin, ether and a range of other virtual assets, after gaining regulatory approval from the ADGM and Financial Services Regulatory Authority for its local launch.  ""For us, it's really important to facilitate access to global markets and global liquidity by making sure that investors and traders in the region have access to local currencies,"" Ting said. Kraken, which launched in 2011 and operates in over 60 countries, said the UAE launch marks a wider play into an increasingly lucrative region. The Middle East is one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets in the world, making up 7% of global trading volumes, according to Chainalysis. The UAE transacts approximately $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency each year. It ranks third by volume in the region, behind Lebanon (about $26 billion) and Turkey ($132.4 billion), according to Chainalysis data studied between July 2020 and June 2021.  ""One of the reasons we see an influx of entrepreneurs, builders, operators and developers coming into Abu Dhabi and Dubai … is because there is a sense of greater regulatory clarity at ADGM, in Dubai, and at a federal level,"" Ronit Ghose, global head of fintech and digital at Citi, told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Thursday.  ""It's frankly amazing some of the talent the UAE has attracted in the last 12 to 24 months during COVID,"" Ghose said. ""Is it really beginning to establish itself as both a crypto hub and a Web3 hub.""  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is among those also considering a bigger presence in the Middle East, where cryptocurrency trading is becoming increasingly mainstream. Binance was given approval to operate in Abu Dhabi in recent weeks, and will recruit for over 100 positions in the country.

2022-04-25,"If you want your tax refund quickly, don't ignore letters from the Internal Revenue Service.Even though Tax Day has passed, letters are common this time of year. They're usually requests for more information relating to your tax return or to verify your identity. If you don't reply, you could be delaying your tax refund for weeks or months, or possibly leaving it unclaimed.You might also get what's known as an adjustment letter, which gives notice about additional taxes owed or a change in your refund amount. Typically, the adjustment is based on incorrect information that was entered on your tax return.These letters provide instructions on how to pay any taxes owed and how to dispute your claim if you think the IRS has made an error in their calculations. Here are three things to do if you receive an IRS letter or notice. Not all letters from the IRS will be a tax bill or a notification of an audit. In fact, some might contain a check for a tax refund that you weren't expecting, based on an adjustment made by the IRS to your tax return on your behalf. If your letter requires a response or other action, take care of it as soon as possible. If you owe money to the IRS, you'll want to deal with it right away to avoid escalating late penalties and interest charges on your bill. And if you don't owe anything, you could be delaying your refund.If you do receive a bill and you can't afford to pay it, the IRS has a repayment plan that can be gradually paid back in installments. Remember: you won't be sent to jail just because you can't afford to pay your tax bill.  In general, the IRS recommends that taxpayers keep records for three years from the date they filed the tax return, including letters or notices from the agency. Many of these letters provide information about money owed to you, like economic stimulus payments, that can be used as reference when filling out your tax return. They can also be used to help you resolve a dispute with the IRS. If you're unsure that the IRS has received your tax return, or you were wondering if a tax refund has been delivered to you, check out www.usa.gov/check-tax-status.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: A gallon of gas was 65 cents in 1978—here's how much it cost every year since"
2022-04-26,"Fort Worth is getting into the crypto mining business, albeit in a small way.Each of the program's three machines will consume the same amount of energy as a household vacuum cleaner, according to city estimates. Fort Worth, Texas, is now the first city government in the United States to mine bitcoin — and in an almost poetic devotion to the initiative, Mayor Mattie Parker oversaw the construction of a small mining farm in City Hall.Three Bitmain Antminer S9 mining rigs will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in the climate-controlled information technology wing of Fort Worth City Hall. The city says the miners will be hosted on a private network to minimize the security risk.Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work mining model, meaning that miners around the world run high-powered computers to simultaneously create new bitcoin and to validate transactions. The process requires professional-grade equipment, some technical know-how, and a lot of electricity. That's why Fort Worth's pilot project is starting small, according to the mayor. Each of the program's three machines will consume the same amount of energy as a household vacuum cleaner, according to city estimates. While the mayor doesn't expect the three miners to be major money makers, the cost of electricity needed for the program is expected to be offset by the value of bitcoin mined.Beyond adding bitcoin to the city's balance sheet, Parker — who took office last year and is the city's first-ever millennial mayor — believes that leaning into bitcoin will go a long way toward putting Fort Worth on the map.""For Fort Worth, a lot of people don't know who we are,"" Parker told CNBC.""We want to change that conversation, and we believe that tech innovation including cryptocurrency is the way we're going to do that."" Building a three-rig mine, even in a crypto-friendly jurisdiction like Texas, requires clearing bureaucratic red tape.""This is something brand new for any city,"" said Parker. ""There's a lot of policy here that we've had to jump through hoops to understand.""To make it happen, the city has teamed up with a few key partners, including the Texas Blockchain Council, which donated the three mining rigs (each valued at roughly $600 apiece), and Luxor Technologies, a mining pool, which lets a single miner combine its hashing power with thousands of other miners all over the world to increase their chances of earning bitcoin.Parker, who has been in the job almost a year, got the idea to break into bitcoin after talking with a few friends in the venture capital world, who told her that 80% of venture capital is essentially spent on tech, and cryptocurrency is at the center of that right now.""We're the fastest growing city in the country. There's so much excitement around North Texas and Fort Worth, in particular. To really keep that energy going, we have to push ourselves differently, and we think cryptocurrency is a huge part of our future economy,"" said Parker.After six months, Fort Worth will re-assess and decide whether to sink real cash into building out a mine. Alex Brammer, VP of business development for Luxor, says Fort Worth's move will bolster the legitimacy of bitcoin as a strategic asset.""Mayor Parker is setting an example and effectively de-risking both bitcoin mining and bitcoin treasury strategies for every other mayor in the country, and I wouldn't be surprised to see more announcements like this coming in the future,"" said Brammer.Brammer also cited the possibility that governments could use bitcoin mining to help stabilize electrical grids in the transition to clean power.""In the future, it is likely that bitcoin mines will sit alongside industrial-scale battery storage to provide grid-firming services that prevent blackouts and other interruptions to the grid caused by the addition of intermittent wind and solar generation. In this context, it would make sense for cities to start to fund and build large-scale mining infrastructure themselves.""Texas Blockchain Council President Lee Bratcher, who works with bitcoin miners across the state, is also optimistic on Fort Worth's prospects.""Fort Worth has the geographic proximity to miners and a supportive city leadership that make it a front runner to be the bitcoin mining capital of Texas and therefore the U.S.,"" said Bratcher.For now, the project isn't really about profits, nor helping to fix Texas' temperamental power grid. Instead, it's about being a first-mover and normalizing the idea of a city government mining bitcoin and putting the world's biggest cryptocurrency on their balance sheet.""This is outside the box for any government, right? Usually things move at a snail's pace. And in Fort Worth, we want to do things differently and kind of elbow our way into the room,"" the mayor said."
2022-04-26,"Fidelity Investments will offer investors the option to put bitcoin in their 401(k)s by the middle of this year.As the nation’s largest retirement plan provider, Fidelity's decision could make crypto even more popular and mainstream.Regulators have urged caution against involving cryptocurrencies in 401(k)s, citing speculation, volatility and high valuations for their concern. Fidelity Investments said Tuesday it will offer investors the option to put bitcoin in their 401(k)s, making it the first provider to offer crypto for retirement savings.The crypto offering will be available for 23,000 employers that use Fidelity to administer their retirement accounts by midyear 2022. With $11.3 trillion in assets under administration, Fidelity is the nation's largest retirement plan provider and its decision could make crypto even more popular and mainstream.""There is growing interest from plan sponsors for vehicles that enable them to provide their employees access to digital assets in defined contribution plans, and in turn from individuals with an appetite to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their long-term investment strategies,"" said Dave Gray, head of workplace retirement offerings and platforms at Fidelity Investments. Cloud and intelligence firm MicroStrategy will be the first employer to offer bitcoin in their retirement plan. The Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier Monday morning.Still, regulators have urged caution against involving cryptocurrencies in 401(k)s. Just last month, the Department of Labor asked plan fiduciaries to ""exercise extreme care"" before they consider adding a cryptocurrency option to a 401(k) plan's investment menu for plan participants.The Department of Labor cited concerns about speculation and volatility as well as high valuation. Meanwhile, it warned of major custodial and record-keeping issues, saying simply losing or forgetting a password can result in the loss of the asset forever.Fidelity said the digital assets account is a custom plan account that holds bitcoin and short-term money market investments to provide the liquidity needed for the account to facilitate daily transactions on behalf of the investor.Bitcoin in the DAA will be held on the Fidelity digital assets custody platform to ensure institutional-grade security, Fidelity said."
2022-04-26,"Fidelity Investments, the largest 401(k) administrator, said Tuesday it's offering a bitcoin investment to workplace retirement plans.Employers have legal duties to ensure their 401(k) investments are prudent. The U.S. Department of Labor said in March that it has concerns about the wisdom of crypto in retirement plans.Businesses should undergo and document a thorough vetting process before offering crypto in retirement plans. Fidelity Investments is offering bitcoin to 401(k) investors. But before retirement savers get access, employers must give the green light — and that's often much more complicated than it sounds.Fidelity administered almost $2.9 trillion of 401(k) and other workplace retirement plan assets (representing over a quarter of the market) at the end of 2020, according to Cerulli Associates, serving 26 million investors in roughly 34,000 plans.The firm said Tuesday it would let employers adopt a new Fidelity-developed bitcoin fund (the Digital Assets Account) as a main 401(k) investment choice, alongside other core investments such as stock, bond and target-date funds. Administrators hadn't previously allowed this.

Fidelity is also ""having a lot of discussions"" with other employers about adding the bitcoin fund, according to Dave Gray, Fidelity's head of workplace retirement platforms and offerings.Here's the challenge for businesses: They have a rigorous legal obligation when it comes to selecting and overseeing 401(k) investments available to workers. This vetting process governs all 401(k) investments, but most employers aren't aware these duties exist, say financial advisors.There are many factors to weigh aside from employee demand — and making a misstep might mean an investor lawsuit down the road, especially given crypto's volatility, financial advisors said. ""You sponsor a retirement plan, you're responsible for outcomes,"" said Ellen Lander, founder of Renaissance Benefit Advisors Group, based in New York. ""Yes, participants make their own decisions, but you've made the decision for what to give them."" The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 sets legal standards for employers sponsoring 401(k) plans. They operate as ""fiduciaries"" who must act prudently and with a duty of loyalty to plan participants.A company CEO's personal beliefs as to whether crypto is a ""good"" or ""bad"" investment doesn't have a bearing on the business' fiduciary duty to investors, advisors said. And employers can't offer an investment solely because employees are clamoring for it.For example, employers must consider factors such as risk, return, cost and diversification benefits, and whether an investment is in the best interests of the collective workforce, advisors said. They must also monitor these and many other elements on an ongoing basis, too.The U.S. Department of Labor recently cast doubt on whether plan sponsors can uphold those duties relative to cryptocurrency investments. In a compliance bulletin, the department urged employers to ""exercise extreme care"" before offering crypto to workers. The Labor Department cites ""significant risks,"" such as speculation and volatility, to 401(k) investors; the department also asserts it will investigate plans that offer crypto and, if necessary, ""take appropriate action"" to protect investors.""The DOL made it very clear it's imprudent,"" said Philip Chao, founder and chief investment officer of Experiential Wealth in Cabin John, Maryland, referring to offering crypto in 401(k) plans.Fidelity, which was working on its bitcoin fund before the Labor Department published its memo, believes it structured its bitcoin fund in a way that addresses the agency's criticisms.For example, workers can't choose to allocate more than 20% of their paycheck contributions or total 401(k) savings to the bitcoin fund. (Employers can opt for a lower cap.) Assets are valued daily, like a typical mutual fund. Fidelity provides education material for would-be investors. In addition, Fidelity keeps track of the private keys that have bedeviled other retail investors who've lost them, Gray said. Further, employers — rather than the Labor Department — are the arbiters of their 401(k) investments, Gray added.""The ultimate decision as to whether or not this digital asset account — or any other investment option — is prudent for a plan belongs to the plan sponsor fiduciary, the employer,"" Gray said.Eleven financial services and business trade groups sent a letter to the Labor Department on April 12 asking it to rescind the crypto notice. Among other things, the letter said there's no legal basis for judging whether any investments are inherently appropriate or inappropriate.   Some 401(k) savers may already have access to crypto-related funds, like bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds, through a little-used mechanism called a ""brokerage window."" (Unlike Fidelity's offering, those funds buy futures contracts and don't offer direct bitcoin ownership.) The brokerage window expands the universe of funds available to 401(k) investors, but those funds aren't traditionally vetted by employers. Some employers who've drafted an investment policy governing how they make 401(k) investment choices may be barred from immediately offering a fund like Fidelity's, Lander said. Many such policies require funds to have existed at least three years before investing.Employers considering adding a bitcoin fund to their main lineup of choices should also thoroughly document their decision-making process, advisors said.""If you're including crypto, are you able to document why you did that and all the reasons why you made the decisions to add it?"" Lander asked. ""If you answer those questions, you have the answers as to whether it makes sense."""

2022-04-27,"Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., called on Congress to investigate his GOP colleague Rep. Madison Cawthorn over allegations Cawthorn may have violated insider trading rules.The allegations from government ethics groups stem from Cawthorn's involvement with Let's Go Brandon coin, a cryptocurrency whose name is based on a conservative meme mocking President Joe Biden.Tillis' call for an investigation came as Cawthorn was already facing criticism from some within the Republican Party. A Republican senator on Wednesday called on Congress to investigate his GOP colleague Rep. Madison Cawthorn, of North Carolina, who has come under fire as ethics watchdogs raise suspicions of possible insider trading over his relationship to an anti-Biden cryptocurrency.""Insider trading by a member of Congress is a serious betrayal of their oath, and Congressman Cawthorn owes North Carolinians an explanation,"" Sen. Thom Tillis, also of North Carolina, wrote on Twitter.""There needs to be a thorough and bipartisan inquiry into the matter by the House Ethics Committee,"" Tillis tweeted.Tillis' tweet ratchets up the already intense pressure Cawthorn was facing from within his own party. The 26-year-old freshman lawmaker's recent comments and other troubles — including a citation Tuesday for bringing a loaded handgun into an airport — have made him a magnet for controversy as the GOP looks to regain majority control of the House in the midterm elections.Tillis last month endorsed Cawthorn's primary challenger, and a Tillis-tied super PAC reportedly spent more than $300,000 on ads that attacked Cawthorn.A spokesman for Cawthorn did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. In an Instagram post Tuesday night, Cawthorn slammed ""Rino senators and establishment pawns [who] want us to go back to the days before [former President Donald] Trump.""Tillis called for the ethics probe after government watchdogs told the Washington Examiner that Cawthorn may have broken federal insider trading laws, which restrict investors from profiting off nonpublic information.Cawthorn has publicly boasted about his holdings of Let's Go Brandon coin, a cryptocurrency which gets its name from a conservative meme mocking President Joe Biden.James Koutoulas, a lawyer and fund manager who is described in an investor lawsuit as the co-founder of the company, posted a photo on Instagram on Dec. 29 at a party with Cawthorn and Erik Norden, another co-founder of the cryptocurrency. Cawthorn's official Instagram account commented on that photo: ""Tomorrow we go to the moon!""One day later, on Dec. 30, the racing team for NASCAR driver Brandon Brown announced that Let's Go Brandon coin had been signed as the team's primary partner for the 2022 season. Koutoulas is quoted in the press release.Let's Go Brandon coin's value shot up more than 75% after the announcement, bringing the total value of all the coins in circulation to more than $570 million, according to news reports. Days later, NASCAR rejected the sponsorship deal, and by February the coin's price had plummeted.The timeline of events suggests to some watchdog groups that Cawthorn may have had nonpublic knowledge of the deal with Brown at the time of the Dec. 29 Instagram post.""It certainly raises some eyebrows,"" said Jordan Libowitz, spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, in a phone interview with CNBC.He said it doesn't look good for Cawthorn, adding that the congressman's actions could pose ethical problems even if they do not violate the law.""We tend to hope that our representatives in the government act on a higher level, that even the appearance of financial impropriety can sometimes be as bad as the impropriety itself,"" he said. ""At the very least, Cawthorn has an optics issue, and at the worst there's a potential legal issue.""Koutoulas in a tweet Tuesday night accused Public Citizen of ""libelous scumbaggery directed at"" Cawthorn after a lobbyist for the group told the Examiner that Cawthorn may have violated insider trading rules.Koutoulas, in a statement to CNBC, called the Examiner's report ""absurd.""""It is not technically or legally possible for a decentralized meme coin that exists to promote free speech and charitable giving to be classified or treated as a security,"" he said.An expert from the Project on Government Oversight, however, told the Examiner that even if the cryptocurrency is not classified as a security, insider trading rules could still apply.In April, an investor in the coin filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the people behind the token of orchestrating a pump-and-dump scheme. The lawsuit does not name Cawthorn as a defendant but includes multiple instances of him promoting the coin. The legal complaint also alleges that after a similar version of the coin was relaunched in February, Cawthorn and others have continued to promote it.Koutoulas' statement said the lawsuit's pump-and-dump allegations are ""ludicrous,"" and slammed the plaintiff as a ""crazed stalker.""Cawthorn recently has been in hot water for driving without a valid license and for claiming that other members of Congress were using drugs and inviting him to orgies. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has said there was no evidence for Cawthorn's claims."
2022-04-27,"Gibraltar published a regulatory amendment Wednesday requiring crypto firms to respect the integrity of markets in which they operate.Despite its small size, the overseas British territory has a track record of developing rules for the crypto market.Some fairly large names have set up shop in Gibraltar and obtained licenses from local regulators, including FTX, Huobi and Bullish. Gibraltar has unveiled new regulations for the cryptocurrency industry, taking aim at potential market manipulation and insider trading in the fast-evolving space.The overseas British territory, located on the southern tip of Spain, published an amendment to existing regulations Wednesday requiring firms dealing in bitcoin and other digital currencies to respect the integrity of markets in which they operate.In a guidance note for regulated crypto companies, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission says firms must combat ""manipulation or improper influencing of prices, liquidity or market information, or any other behaviour which is inimical to market integrity.""""We were the first jurisdiction in 2018 to launch the legal and regulatory framework, and we're now the first jurisdiction to launch a framework for market integrity,"" Albert Isola, Gibraltar's minister for digital and financial services, told CNBC.""The more there is around the world in terms of international standards for this space, the more trust, the more usage, and the more adoption we will have around the world,"" he added. While perhaps better known as a seaport and popular vacation spot, Gibraltar is a hub for a number of other industries, including financial services and gambling. Its latest move forms part of an ongoing bid to lead the way in regulation of the digital currency industry.Despite its small size, Gibraltar has a track record of developing rules for the crypto market. The region, which borders Spain but is under British control, first introduced a licensing regime for blockchain firms back in 2018.Some fairly large names have set up shop in Gibraltar and obtained licenses from local regulators, including FTX, Huobi and Bullish, which is backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.Executives from Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, also visited Gibraltar ""some months back,"" but does not have a license, Isola said. The company is seeking to become a friend rather than foe to regulators after facing crackdowns in numerous countries last year.The Gibraltar Stock Exchange recently agreed to be acquired by Valereum, a blockchain firm, in a bid to become the world's first regulated bourse for share and crypto trading. It's an aim Switzerland's SIX Swiss Exchange is also seeking to achieve with the creation of an exchange for trading blockchain-based securities.The latest rules arrive as various major world economies, including the U.S. and U.K., are now introducing new rules to bring crypto into the regulatory fold.""I think it's a sign that more and more jurisdictions are recognizing the need to do it,"" Isola said. ""And the need to do it is because there's more and more adoption.""However, Isola insisted Gibraltar is ""not doing this to market ourselves,"" adding: ""We want a very small but quality number of firms within our jurisdiction."" Gibraltar has previously been criticized for being a ""tax haven."" Several major U.K. gambling firms, including Entain and 888, set up shop in the rocky peninsula, in part due to its favorable taxation regime. More recently, however, Gibraltar has sought to distance itself from such a reputation.The region is ""fully compliant with all transparency and exchange of information standards applicable in the U.K.,"" Isola said, adding this was at odds with descriptions of Gibraltar as a tax haven. Such transparency standards also apply to crypto, Isola added, meaning ""the bar to entry is high.""Spain last year agreed to take Gibraltar off its list of tax havens after coming to a tax cooperation deal with the U.K. The issue has been a sticking point in London's negotiations with Madrid following Britain's withdrawal from the EU."

2022-04-28,"Ex-Google CEO and chairman Eric Schmidt says he's invested ""a little bit"" of money into cryptocurrencies — but for him, the most interesting part of blockchain isn't virtual currency. It's Web3.""A new model [of the internet] where you as an individual [can] control your identity, and where you don't have a centralized manager, is very powerful. It's very seductive and it's very decentralized,"" Schmidt, 67, tells CNBC Make It. ""I remember that feeling when I was 25 that decentralized would be everything.""Web3 is a name coined by some technologists as a new kind of internet service that's built using decentralized blockchains. The idea, at least in theory, is to build a system where it's much harder for a few companies — like Google, which Schmidt helped transform from a Silicon Valley start-up to a global tech behemoth — to control large amounts of the internet's data and content.Schmidt served as Google's CEO from 2001 to 2011, overseeing one of the company's largest and most notable periods of growth. He stayed on as executive chairman until 2017, and technical advisor until 2020. Currently, Schmidt has a net worth of $20 billion, making him the world's 80th-richest person, according to Forbes.But if he were just starting out as a software engineer today, he says, he'd want to work on AI algorithms or Web3.Schmidt says his interest in Web3 involves a concept called ""tokenomics,"" which refers to the specific supply and demand characteristics of cryptocurrencies. Schmidt also notes that Web3 could come with new models for content ownership and new ways of compensating people.""[Web3's] economics are interesting. The platforms are interesting and the use patterns are interesting,"" Schmidt says. ""[It] doesn't work yet, but it will.""For Schmidt, part of the problem with today's blockchain technology — specifically referencing bitcoin as an example — is that the majority of time people spend on those systems is dedicated to ""making sure that nobody's attacking them ... they're incredibly wasteful.""Schmidt didn't name any specific cryptocurrencies he currently owns, noting that he's just ""starting"" to invest in crypto.

2022-04-28,"Retail brokerage firm Robinhood reported a wider-than-expected loss and shrinking revenue for the first quarter, showing signs that the small-dollar trading boom that captivated Wall Street a year ago may have run out of steam.Robinhood emerged as one of the key players in last year's meme stock saga, with retail traders signing up for accounts and helping drive rapid moves in stocks like GameStop. That made for tough comparisons in the first quarter, but the slowdown in trading activity was even more dramatic than anticipated. ""Our larger customers are still remaining active, but we are seeing more pronounced declines from those that have lower balances,"" CEO Vlad Tenev said on a conference call with investors and analysts. ""With the uncertainty in the market, our customers became more cautious with their portfolios.""Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:Losses per share: 45 cents vs. 36 cents expectedRevenue: $299 million vs. $355.8 million expectedFor the three months ended March 31, Robinhood said its loss narrowed to $392 million, or 45 cents per share, from a loss of $1.4 billion, or $6.26 per share, a year ago. Revenue fell 43% from a year ago to $299 million.Robinhood said its monthly active users declined to 15.9 million, down from 17.7 million in the year ago period and 17.3 million in the previous quarter. The company's average revenue per user came in at $53, down from $137 a year prior and $64 in the previous quarter.The brokerage's main source of revenue is a practice known as payment for order flow. Though trading is free from the customer's perspective, Robinhood earns a spread on the trades that it sends to large trading houses.In an effort to jumpstart revenue and user growth, Robinhood has been introducing new products and features. The company announced in late March that it had expanded extended trading hours.Robinhood also rolled out crypto wallets to customers earlier in April. In the first quarter, revenue from crypto trading declined to $54 million, but that surpassed the $36 million from equities trading. Those numbers were $88 million and $133 million, respectively, a year ago.Options trading was the biggest area of revenue at $127 million, down from $198 million a year ago.""This story was the story of two competing forces — our accelerating product development juxtaposed against a difficult macroeconomic climate,"" Tenev said.Robinhood is also watching its costs. On Tuesday, Robinhood said it will cut its full-time workforce by about 9%, citing ""duplicate roles and job functions"" for the layoffs. The company said Thursday it now expects operating expenses to increase between 2% and 5% in 2022, excluding share-based compensation. Previous guidance called for an increase of 15% to 20%.Tenev said the company aimed to have positive adjusted EBITDA — or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — by the end of the year. That metric showed a loss of $143 million in the first quarter.Robinhood went public in July 2021 at $38 per share, but the stock has struggled to find traction.

2022-04-29,"The Blockchain Association has been lobbying against two bills designed to curtail the use of cryptocurrency as a way to evade sanctions.The Mortgage Bankers Association, an advocacy group for the real estate finance industry, listed on their first quarter lobbying disclosure a focus on a bill intended to ""expose the assets of oligarchs."" The cryptocurrency industry has been quietly lobbying U.S. lawmakers against legislation designed to prevent Russian oligarchs from using digital currencies to evade sanctions imposed on Russian President Vladimir Putin's allies and their companies following Russia's attack on Ukraine.The Blockchain Association, a lobbying group that represents more than 70 crypto platforms including Ripple, Crypto.com and Dragonfly Capital, is trying to convince Congress that cryptocurrencies aren't being used by wealthy Russians to to avoid sanctions. It's working with lobbying shop Forbes Tate Partners against legislation that would impose more sanctions on already penalized Russians who are aiming to use crypto as a way to avoid sanctions. The bill would also empower the Treasury secretary to block crypto trading platforms based in the U.S. from doing business with those in Russia.Two bills have been introduced in U.S. House and Senate that gives the Biden administration the authority to prohibit U.S. crypto exchanges from processing payments from Russia. The bills would also allow U.S. authorities to sanction foreign exchanges that process transactions by sanctioned Russian people or companies.The legislation poses a grave threat to the industry, which critics say has become popular for clandestine transactions because they cannot be traced. It would essentially subject digital currencies to some of the same rules that require federally insured banks to know their customers, combat money laundering and report suspicious transactions to regulators.The group says it's helping Congress ""separate fact from fiction on the inability of Russia to transfer large sums of money via crypto transactions in order to evade sanctions,"" according to an email from Curtis Kincaid, the group's spokesman. A Forbes Tate Partners representative declined to comment, referring CNBC to the Blockchain Association for questions.Jake Chervinsky, the policy head of the Blockchain Association, later said the bills aren't targeting Russian oligarchs, they are taking direct aim at U.S. crypto companies.""These bills don't target Russian oligarchs, who aren't using (& can't use) crypto to evade sanctions. They target upstanding US crypto companies for no apparent reason except @SenWarren's crusade against a technology she doesn't understand,"" Chervinsky said in a tweet after publication of this story.The crypto industry has stepped up its lobbying efforts as the Biden administration takes a hard look at whether and how to regulate digital assets. President Joe Biden signed an executive order in March calling on regulators to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies.The Blockchain Association spent $460,000 on its own in-house lobbyists during the first quarter, a record amount since it launched in 2018, lobbying disclosure records show. The crypto lobbying shop said last year it received more than $4 million in donations from three crypto giants: Digital Currency Group, Kraken and Filecoin Foundation.The group is lobbying against the Russian Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Act, according to its first-quarter report. The House bill would target Russians and their affiliated companies who try to use cryptocurrency to get around their own sanctions. Crypto industry leaders say the digital currencies can't be used to evade sanctions.Some lawmakers, however, say digital currencies should be regulated the same as a bank since the industry pitches itself as an alternative banking system. The U.S. has sanctioned a plethora of Russian-based financial institutions, including the country's central bank. The Treasury Department recently took aim at bitcoin miners operating in Russia.""The crypto industry fancies itself as an alternative financial system, an alternative bank. Banks have been sanctioned left, right and center, and banks are pulling out of Russia,"" Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California, who is a co-sponsor of the House bill, told CNBC in a recent interview. ""So if they fancy themselves a financial mechanism, then they're in the same league, the same situation, as Bank of America or a Russian bank.""The group is also lobbying on the accompanying bill sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in the Senate, according to its first-quarter lobbying disclosure report. That bill, titled the Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act of 2022 — an almost identical name as the one introduced by Democrats in the House — is also designed ""to impose sanctions with respect to the use of cryptocurrency to facilitate transactions by Russian persons subject to sanctions,"" according to a summary of the bill.Warren, who is a member of the powerful Senate Finance and Banking committees, recently told National Public Radio that the bill is supposed to give the Treasury Department the tools to step up its oversight of crypto platforms.""Russian oligarchs can continue to use crypto to move their money around. So we're just going to give Treasury the authorization to treat these crypto platforms much like the banks are treated. That is, you've got to know your customer and you can't be dealing with people who are in violation of sanctions,"" Warren said during the interview last month.Warren accused the crypto industry of undermining U.S. national security and the sanctions against Russia.""It's no surprise that the unregulated crypto industry has deep pockets and an army of lobbyists who are fighting against basic rules to keep consumers safe, but it's shocking that they would also work to undermine U.S. national security and our sanctions regime against Russia,"" Warren said in an emailed statement.The Mortgage Bankers Association, an advocacy group for the mortgage finance industry, similarly listed on their quarterly filing the Klepto Act, a bipartisan bill backed by Warren, along with Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.; Bill Cassidy, R-La.; and Roger Wicker, R- Miss., according to the group's first-quarter report. A representative for the Mortgage Bankers Association initially did not return a request for comment.Bill Killmer, a chief lobbyist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, told CNBC in a statement days after publication that it had yet to take a position on the bill. ""As you would expect, MBA monitors all legislation that could impact real estate finance including S. 4075 The KLEPTO Act.  We have taken no official position on this bill,"" Killmer said in an emailed statement on Monday. The legislation is designed to expose the real estate holdings ""of oligarchs, kleptocrats, and international criminals hidden in the United States, strengthen U.S. anti-money laundering safeguards, and arm law enforcement with the information required to track down kleptocrats' luxury assets in the U.S. financial system,"" according to a press release."

""My message to them is simple: We will not give up,"" he said on Twitter.In an interview with Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya, Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said NATO ""considers itself"" at war with Russia, even though Moscow doesn't see itself at war with NATO.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office says it has a planned operation to evacuate civilians from the blockaded Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, the last holdout against Russian forces in the bombarded city.Meanwhile, Russian strikes shook residential buildings in Kyiv overnight, as the UN chief and Bulgarian prime minister visited the city.  Sat, Apr 30 20224:03 AM EDT The United Nations will not give up, but will ""redouble its efforts to save lives and reduce human suffering,"" Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a Twitter post on Friday.The UN chief said he was ""moved by the resilience and bravery of the people of Ukraine. My message to them is simple: We will not give up.""""In this war, as in all wars, the civilians always pay the highest price,"" he said. Guterres has just returned from the war-torn country, where he visited the Kyiv suburbs of Borodianka, Bucha and Irpin nine weeks after Russia began its illegal and unprovoked war.""When we see this horrendous site, it makes me feel how important it is [to have] a thorough investigation and accountability,"" he said Thursday, when he was in Bucha — where horrific photos of mass graves and executed civilians strewn in the streets sparked global outrage.""The war is an absurdity in the 21st century. The war is evil,"" he said during his visit to Ukraine, where he also met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.— Joanna Tan  Sat, Apr 30 20222:17 AM EDT Russia continues to face ""considerable challenges"" in its war against Ukraine, the U.K. Defence Ministry said.""It has been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from the failed advances in north-east Ukraine. Many of these units are likely suffering from weakened morale,"" the ministry said on Twitter.""Shortcomings in Russian tactical co-ordination remain. A lack of unit-level skills and inconsistent air support have left Russia unable to fully leverage its combat mass, despite localised improvements,"" said the latest British intelligence report.In a bid to fix problems that have constrained its advances, Moscow is trying to concentrate combat power geographically, shorten its supply lines and simplify command and control, the report said.— Joanna Tan  Sat, Apr 30 20221:14 AM EDT U.S. troops in Germany have started training Ukrainian soldiers on the use of heavy weapons to defend their country against Russian attacks, the Pentagon said Friday.""These efforts build on the initial artillery training that Ukraine's forces already have received elsewhere and also includes training on radar systems and armored vehicles that have been recently announced as part of security assistance packages,"" Press Secretary John F. Kirby said.This week, President Joe Biden called on Congress to authorize as much as $33 billion in humanitarian and military aid to Kyiv in its fight against Moscow's attacks.Canada has given heavy artillery to Ukrainian forces, including M-777 howitzers and anti-armor ammunition, the Canadian government said last week.Canadian service members are training Ukrainians on the M-777 howitzer in Europe, Kirby added, citing Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand.— Joanna Tan  Fri, Apr 29 202211:31 PM EDT Russia's foreign minister says Moscow does not consider itself at war with NATO.In an interview with Saudi Arabia's Al-Arabiya TV channel, Sergei Lavrov said: ""Unfortunately, NATO, it seems, considers itself to be at war with Russia.""""NATO and European Union leaders, many of them, in England, in the United States, Poland, France, Germany and of course European Union chief diplomat Josep Borrell, they bluntly, publicly and consistently say, 'Putin must fail, Russia must be defeated,'"" he told the network.""When you use this terminology,"" he said, ""I believe you think that you are at war with the person who you want to be defeated."" Lavrov — who has been sanctioned by the U.S., U.K. and Europe for his role in the war — reportedly said his country's ""special operation"" in Ukraine is ""a response to what NATO was doing in Ukraine to prepare this country for a very aggressive posture against the Russian Federation.""He told Al-Arabiya that Ukraine was given arms that can reach Russian territory, and that military bases were being built, including on the Sea of Azov — where the battle for the besieged port city of Mariupol continues today.Russian forces have largely destroyed the city of Mariupol, though Moscow falsely claims that it doesn't target civilian areas.Lavrov claimed many military exercises held on Ukrainian territory ""were conducted under NATO auspices, and most of these exercises were designed against the [interests] of the Russian Federation, so the purpose of this operation is to make sure that those plans do not materialize.""— Joanna Tan  Fri, Apr 29 20225:02 PM EDT Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was a high risk that peace talks with Moscow would end, and U.S. lawmakers pledged to move fast on a plan to send as much as $33 billion to help Kyiv keep fighting Russia's assault.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had said during a visit to Kyiv on Thursday that intense discussions were underway to evacuate civilians from the steel works in Mariupol, which is under heavy Russian attack as part of an offensive in the south and east. One of the fighters holed up in the city, a major target of Russia's invasion, told Reuters the comments gave him hope hundreds of civilians blocked with them at the plant for weeks would be evacuated after many failed attempts.Zelenskyy's office had said an operation was planned to get civilians out of the plant on Friday but there was no sign of an evacuation as dusk fell. He later expressed pessimism over the prospect of continued peace talks with Russia, blaming public anger with what he said were atrocities by Russian troops.""People (Ukrainians) want to kill them. When that kind of attitude exists, it's hard to talk about things,"" Interfax quoted him as telling Polish journalists.— Reuters  Fri, Apr 29 20224:49 PM EDT President Joe Biden's ask for $33 billion in aid to Ukraine hit an early snag on Capitol Hill, where a dispute over immigration policy threatens to hamstring urgently needed assistance to Kyiv.Congressional Republicans object to Democrats' attempt to link the $33 billion requested for Ukraine with a separate bipartisan compromise providing $10 billion in additional Covid funding.Republicans, who oppose a $10 billion plan to expand Covid relief, say they want to advance the aid to Ukraine without the coronavirus legislation tacked on.Should Democrats insist that the bills be linked, Senate Republicans will likely force a vote on the Biden administration's controversial decision to end a pandemic-era policy called Title 42, which allowed border agents to turn away migrants at the U.S.-Mexican border.  Fri, Apr 29 20224:14 PM EDT Pentagon spokesman John Kirby became visibly upset during a press briefing when reflecting on the ongoing conflict and the horrific reports of potential war crimes in Ukraine.When asked if the U.S. believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was a rational actor, Kirby quickly said that he was not a psychologist and could not make such an assessment.""I'm not going to go into the psychology of Vladimir Putin. It's hard to look at what he's doing in Ukraine, what his forces are doing in Ukraine and think that any ethical, moral individual could justify that,"" Kirby said.""It's difficult to look at the ... sorry,"" Kirby said, taking a few moments before continuing his response. ""It's difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well thinking serious mature leader would do that.""Kirby, who spent nearly three decades in the U.S. Navy before retiring at the rank of Rear Admiral and who has worked as a spokesman at both the Pentagon and State Department, apologized for getting emotional at the podium.""I didn't mean to get emotional. I apologize for that. I don't want to make this about me,"" he said.""Innocent people shot in the back of the head, hands tied behind their backs, pregnant women being killed, hospitals being bombed. I mean, it's just unconscionable,"" Kirby added.— Amanda Macias  Fri, Apr 29 20223:16 PM EDT Pentagon spokesman John Kirby slammed Russia's recent rhetoric on expanding its war past Ukraine's borders.""We absolutely respect Moldova's sovereignty. We want every other nation in the world to respect it. A Russian general out there claiming that Moldova is next is clearly irresponsible rhetoric,"" Kirby said, referencing remarks made by Russian commander Rustam Minnekayev.Last week, Minnekayev said that Moscow wanted ""full control"" of eastern and southern Ukraine and would seek to create a ""land corridor"" from Russia in the east to Transnistria to Crimea, a peninsula on the Black Sea that Russia forcefully annexed from Ukraine in 2014.""I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about what the Russians will do,"" Kirby said, adding that the U.S. was aware of reports of attacks in Transnistria, which shares a border with Moldova and Russia.The ongoing war next door has put the landlocked country of Moldova, a former Soviet republic and one of Europe's poorest nations, in a precarious position. Moldova is Eastern Europe's smallest nation, with a population of fewer than 3 million and a landmass slightly larger than the state of Maryland.Adding to Moldova's vulnerability on Eastern Europe's frontlines is its complete reliance on Russian gas supplies.— Amanda Macias  Fri, Apr 29 20222:03 PM EDT One of the most capable and expensive weapon systems being supplied to Ukraine is the FGM-148 Javelin, a U.S.-made anti-armor weapon that costs about $176,000 each.Watch this video to find out what the Javelin is, how it it used and what it will take for the U.S. to produce more of them.  Fri, Apr 29 20221:54 PM EDT Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that the U.S. has resumed joint training with Ukrainian troops at three locations in Europe.In November, 160 members of the Florida National Guard, assigned to the 53rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, deployed to Ukraine to train with local forces. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered U.S. troops who deployed to Ukraine last year to leave the country and reposition elsewhere in Europe.The new marching orders came as an estimated 100,000 Russian troops equipped with advanced weaponry lined Ukraine's eastern border and the northern border with Belarus.""I can announce that the United States has commenced training with Ukrainian armed forces on key systems at U.S. military installations in Germany. These efforts build on the initial artillery training that Ukraine's forces already have received,"" Kirby said, adding that there would be additional training on radars and armored personal vehicles.""The recent reunion of the Florida National Guard members with their Ukrainian colleagues, we are told was an emotional meeting, given the strong bonds that were formed as they were living together before parting ways in February,"" Kirby added.— Amanda Macias  Fri, Apr 29 20221:16 PM EDT Parts of war-torn Ukraine that have little or no internet service have found an alternative: emergency Starlink receivers.The SpaceX-run satellite internet service that CEO Elon Musk touted at the start of the war has emerged as a lifeline for many areas of the country, with over 10,000 dish antennas in service and more on the way. In Ukraine, Starlink's technology has found a place where it can prove itself, especially being used in ways other than how it was intended. Throughout its invasion, Russia has consistently attacked Ukrainian communications infrastructure with both military weapons and cyberattacks. Read the full story here.— NBC News  Fri, Apr 29 202212:38 PM EDT Russia looks to have averted a historic sovereign default by tapping its domestic reserves and attempting to make overdue dollar payments on its international debt obligations.Earlier Friday, Russia's Finance Ministry said that it had attempted the dollar payments — a dramatic U-turn after the country had previously attempted to make the payments on its dollar-denominated bonds in Russian rubles.The ministry said it had made a payment of $564.8 million on a 2022 eurobond and a payment of $84.4 million on a 2042 eurobond, according to Reuters, with both in dollars — which was originally stipulated on the debt agreements.The funds have reportedly been channeled to the London branch of Citibank but it's unclear whether they will reach their intended recipients. The payments were due to be made in April and had entered a 30-day grace period before official default on May 4.Russian government bonds rallied on Friday afternoon after the news from the Finance Ministry. But close Moscow watchers like Timothy Ash, emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, were unsure whether it would still be able to avoid a default.— Matt Clinch and Elliot Smith  Fri, Apr 29 202212:22 PM EDT Russian forces are a few days behind schedule in the Donbas region of Ukraine, a senior U.S. Defense official said.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share new details from the Pentagon's latest assessment of the war, added that Russian troops are still beset with a range of challenges, including food and fuel shortages.""We do believe and assess that [the Russians] are behind schedule in what they are trying to accomplish in the Donbas,"" the official said.In recent weeks, the U.S. has accelerated its weapons packages to Ukraine due to Western intelligence that indicated Russian forces were leaving key positions near Kyiv and relocating to areas in the east of Ukraine for an intensified fight.On Thursday, the official said that the U.S. had observed the Russians making ""slow and uneven progress"" in the Donbas.— Amanda Macias  Fri, Apr 29 202212:05 PM EDT The cryptocurrency industry has been quietly lobbying U.S. lawmakers against legislation designed to prevent Russian oligarchs from using digital currencies to evade sanctions imposed on Russian President Vladimir Putin's allies and their companies following Russia's attack on Ukraine.The Blockchain Association, a lobbying group that represents more than 70 crypto platforms including Ripple, Crypto.com and Dragonfly Capital, is trying to convince Congress that cryptocurrencies aren't being used by wealthy Russians to to avoid sanctions. It's working with lobbying shop Forbes Tate Partners against legislation that would impose more sanctions on already penalized Russians who are aiming to use crypto as a way to avoid sanctions. The bill would also empower the Treasury secretary to block crypto trading platforms based in the U.S. from doing business with those in Russia.Two bills have been introduced in U.S. House and Senate that gives the Biden administration the authority to prohibit U.S. crypto exchanges from processing payments from Russia. The bills would also allow U.S. authorities to sanction foreign exchanges that process transactions by sanctioned Russian people or companies.The legislation poses a grave threat to the industry, which critics say has become popular for clandestine transactions because they cannot be traced. It would essentially subject digital currencies to some of the same rules that require federally insured banks to know their customers, combat money laundering and report suspicious transactions to regulators.— Brian Schwartz  Fri, Apr 29 202211:06 AM EDT The Dutch Ambassador to Ukraine Jennes de Mol returned to Kyiv with a small number of embassy staff,  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a statement. ""A diplomatic mission in Kyiv is of great value in maintaining contact with the Ukrainian government. Embassies of other EU countries are also returning. It is important for the Netherlands to work closely with all these countries, including in Ukraine,"" the statement said.The Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that citizens should not travel to the war-weary country.The Netherlands is the latest country to reopen its diplomatic mission in Ukraine's capital, following France, Italy, Turkey, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Belgium and Austria. The European Union has also reopened its diplomatic mission in Kyiv while the United States has returned its diplomatic mission to Lviv.— Amanda Macias  Fri, Apr 29 202210:49 AM EDT The Ukrainian military claims it has retaken a strategically important village along the highway connecting the major city of Kharkiv in Ukraine with the Russian city of Belgorod.According to a Telegram post from the official channel of the Land Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the village of Ruska Lozova in the Kharkiv oblast has been liberated and is now completely under the control of Ukrainian troops.CNBC was unable to independently verify the status of Ruska Lozova, but Ukrainian troops have been slowly moving eastward from the Kyiv suburbs and liberating town after town occupied by Russian forces during the first few weeks of the war.Ruska Lozova is important because it is one of the villages that Russian forces retreated to after they failed to take Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.Unable to fully occupy Kharkiv, Moscow has instead chosen to shell civilian infrastructure and residential neighborhoods in the city almost constantly for weeks, using artillery placed in outlying villages like Ruska Lozova.--- Christina Wilkie  Fri, Apr 29 202210:17 AM EDT The United Nations says it has confirmed 2,899 civilian deaths and 3,235 injuries in Ukraine since Russia invaded its ex-Soviet neighbor on Feb. 24.Of those killed, the U.N. has identified at least 210 children.The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Monday that the death toll in Ukraine is likely higher, citing delayed reports due to the armed conflict.The international body said most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, as well as missiles and airstrikes.— Amanda Macias  Fri, Apr 29 20229:57 AM EDT  Ukraine acknowledged it was taking heavy losses in Russia's assault in the east, but said Russia's losses were even worse, as U.S. President Joe Biden called on Congress to send as much as $33 billion to help Kyiv withstand the attack.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Biden's offer of help, which amounts to nearly 10 times the aid Washington has sent so far since the war began on Feb. 24.Having failed in an assault on Kyiv in the north of Ukraine last month, Russia is now trying to fully capture two eastern provinces known as the Donbas. Ukraine has acknowledged losing control of some towns and villages there since the assault began last week, but says Moscow's gains have come at a massive cost to a Russian force already worn down from its earlier defeat near the capital.""We have serious losses but the Russians' losses are much much bigger ... They have colossal losses,"" presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said.— Reuters  Fri, Apr 29 20228:37 AM EDT Two British aid workers have been detained by Russian forces near Ukraine's southern city of Zaporizhzhia, the U.K.-based non-profit Presidium Network said.The group's founder Dominik Byrne told the BBC on Friday that the two men ""got through a Ukraine checkpoint to go south through Russian controlled area when we lost contact on Monday morning.""Presidium said that the two volunteers were civilians working independently but as part of a mission in Ukraine to provide medical supplies, food and evacuation help.Byrne said he was working ""to get the support we need from the U.K. government and from the international community, as well as on the ground,"" and that he was seeking ""clarification about how they are and how safe they are"" and whether they were being ""treated properly.""The U.K.'s Foreign Office ""is doing all it can to support and identify these two people,"" British trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan told Sky News on Friday.— Natasha Turak  Fri, Apr 29 20227:04 AM EDT The U.K. is sending experts to help Ukraine's government collect evidence and prosecute Russian war crimes against civilians, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said. Ukraine says it is investigating more than 7,000 potential war crimes in the wake of Russia's unprovoked invasion. ""Russia has brought barbarity to Ukraine and committed vile atrocities, including against women. British expertise will help uncover the truth and hold Putin's regime to account for its actions,"" Truss said. The foreign secretary is traveling to The Hague to meet with International Criminal Court President Judge Piotr Hofmanski and Dutch Foreign Secretary Wopke Hoekstra.""The specialist team will assist the Ukrainian government as they gather evidence and prosecute war crimes and will include experts in conflict-related sexual violence,"" a foreign office statement said.— Natasha Turak  Fri, Apr 29 20226:51 AM EDT American citizen Willy Joseph Cancel was killed while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in Ukraine, CNN has reported.Cancel, a former U.S. Marine, was 22 years old and working for a private military contractor when he was sent by his company to fight in Ukraine, his mother Rebecca Cabrera said.""He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for, and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn't come here, and that maybe our American soldiers wouldn't have to be involved in it,"" Cabrera told CNN in a phone interview.Cancel entered Ukraine via Poland in mid-March and was killed on Monday, his mother said.NBC has reached out to Cancel's family and the State Department. Quoted by CNN, a State Department official said they are ""aware of these reports and are closely monitoring the situation.""""Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment,"" the official added. ""We once again reiterate U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of U.S. citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials, and that U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so, using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options.""More than 20,000 foreign fighters from 52 countries, many of whom are military veterans, have volunteered to fight against the Russian invasion in Ukraine, according to Ukraine's Defense Ministry, which created the International Legion to serve that purpose.— Natasha Turak  Fri, Apr 29 20226:30 AM EDT Russia has repeatedly warned of the risks of nuclear war and of swift retaliation ""if necessary"" as its invasion of Ukraine continues and it faces stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces armed with advanced Western weaponry.Moscow has warned NATO states to stop arming Ukrainian forces, and has made frequent reference to its war arsenal, which includes nuclear weapons. But strategists have told CNBC that Putin is playing on risk aversion in the West and that the chances of a nuclear war are remote.One close Russia watcher said Western governments need to imbue their populations with a ""war mentality"" to prepare them for the hardships they could face as the economic fallout from the war continues.Those include rising energy costs and disrupted supply chains and goods from Russia and Ukraine, among the world's biggest ""bread baskets.""Read the full story.— Holly Ellyatt  Fri, Apr 29 20224:46 AM EDT The United Nations has faced scathing criticism over what many describe as its slow and ineffective response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In response to that, its Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed admitted that there will be ""lessons learned"" over the conflict, and that it came as ""a big shock to the system."" ""Of course, there are things that we could have done to stop the war, but perhaps those are going to be lessons learned again, when the Security Council, the General Assembly leaders will look back and say, 'what could we have done, and make sure that we prevent the next war, the next pandemic',"" Mohammed told CNBC.""These are all things that we are learning. I think history tells us that we're not very good learners when it comes to that.""""I hope that the learnings will find ways to make us more accountable to put in the checks and balances that this doesn't ever happen again, and that we are working towards peace,"" Mohammed added.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited Moscow to meet with Putin and later traveled to Kyiv, after being criticized for not playing a strong enough role in the conflict and for visiting Russia before Ukraine.Read the full story.— Tania Bryer and Natasha Turak  Fri, Apr 29 20224:34 AM EDT Replacing Russian gas with other sources will be next to impossible in the near term, Alfred Stern, CEO of Austrian oil and gas company OMV, told CNBC.""On the supply of gas for Europe, I think we should be rather clear, that in the short run it will be very difficult for Europe if not impossible to substitute the Russian gas flows,"" Stern told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""Some countries have the possibility of drawing on alternate sources of the commodity, ""but if you look at the total European picture, the quantities just work out in such a way that we will not be able to substitute in the short run the full quantity with European production or imports from other sources,"" the CEO said.""The capacity currently is not here, it can be built up over time, but in the short run this is not possible.""The comments come days after Russia announced it was cutting off its gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, after the two countries refused a Russian demand to pay for the imports in rubles, since Moscow is cut off by sanctions from being paid in euros or dollars.As the EU, which imports 40% of its gas from Russia, grapples with the reality of Moscow using its energy as a weapon, analysts and executives have warned of a recession in Europe if Russia fully turns off the taps.  ""It will be critical because it could have significant impact on our economy, on the running of industry, because we depend on the availability of energy for this,"" Stern said.  — Natasha Turak  Fri, Apr 29 20223:18 AM EDT Russian strikes in Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Thursday hit residential buildings and wounded 10 people, Ukrainian emergency services said.Witness reported large explosions in Kyiv's northwestern Shevchenkivsky district that left windows blown out and parts of buildings blackened. It came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov visited the city, and as Ukrainian residents begin to return.""Shocked and appalled about the Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Russia demonstrates again its blatant disregard for intl law by bombarding a city while @UN Secretary General @antonioguterres is present, alongside Bulgarian PM @KirilPetkov,"" the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a tweet.— Natasha Turak  Fri, Apr 29 20221:58 AM EDT Russia may be preparing to stage ""sham referenda"" in Ukraine's south and east — in areas it has illegally seized since Feb. 24 — to legitimize its illegal invasion and assert control there, said the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Russia is planning to force Ukraine's government to surrender, including dissolving all local municipal governments, while setting up new government structures in ""liberated"" territories under Russian control, ambassador Michael Carpenter said in a speech to OSCE.He added that Russian officials and so-called separatists are developing plans for a new government and constitution.""This planning includes a moratorium disallowing legitimate Ukrainian leaders and those supporting Ukraine's legitimate government from any leadership positions,"" Carpenter said. He added that the plans are ""straight out of Russia's playbook"" of orchestrating ""so-called referenda in the Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk — each time with faked high percentages of public support"" and installing puppet regimes there.Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and the country has been supporting a separatist rebellion in the Donbas — made up of Ukrainian cities Luhansk and Donetsk — since 2014.Carpenter added that Russia is likely to intensify ongoing deportations of Ukrainians.""We should expect Russia to intensify its ongoing forced transfers of local populations from areas of Ukraine's south and east to Russia or Russia-controlled parts of the Donbas via so-called ""filtration camps,"" Carpenter said.— Chelsea Ong  Fri, Apr 29 20222:40 AM EDT Ukraine says it has a plan to evacuate the roughly 1,000 civilians who are holed up in the massive Azovstal steel plant complex in the besieged city of Mariupol.""An operation is planned today to get civilians out of the plant,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said, without further elaboration.The site has become one of the last significant holdouts of Ukrainian forces in an otherwise Russian-occupied city.Mariupol, a strategic port city in Ukraine's south and just 30 miles from the Russian border, has seen some of the most brutal bombardment of the entire Russian campaign, and has been cut off from electricity, food, and most humanitarian aid since the start of March. Satellite imagery has revealed what Western and Ukrainian officials believe are mass graves just outside the city.Russia's defense ministry has in past days said it was opening a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the steel plant. But multiple previous attempts have failed, with Kyiv blaming Russian forces for not holding their fire to allow safe passage. Moscow, meanwhile, blames Ukrainian forces for the failure.— Natasha Turak  Fri, Apr 29 20222:41 AM EDT The battle for Donbas is Russia's primary focus, as it aims to take over Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions, the U.K. Ministry of Defence wrote in its daily intelligence update Friday.So far, significant Ukrainian resistance is hampering Moscow's progress, it added.In the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts (or administrative districts), ""fighting has been particularly heavy around Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, with an attempted advance south from Izium towards Slovyansk,"" the ministry wrote on Twitter.""Due to strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian territorial gains have been limited and achieved at significant cost to Russian forces.""— Natasha Turak  Fri, Apr 29 202212:08 AM EDT Ukraine's prosecutor general has identified 10 Russian soldiers she said were involved in the atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine, according to the Associated Press.Iryna Venediktova appealed to the public on Facebook to help gather evidence against those soldiers whom she said were ""involved in the torture of peaceful people."" They were from Russia's 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Ground Forces Brigade whose work President Vladimir Putin recently honored, the AP said.""During the occupation of Bucha, they took unarmed civilians hostage, killed them with hunger and thirst, kept them on their knees with hands tied and eyes taped, mocked and beat them,"" she reportedly said, adding that the soldiers threatened to shoot the civilians and looted houses.On Thursday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited Bucha, calling for an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine.— Chelsea Ong  Thu, Apr 28 20223:55 PM EDT The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv says one of its employees was killed in the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.""Volodymyr, who took leave from his job as an Embassy bodyguard to rejoin the army and defend Ukraine,"" the U.S. mission in Kyiv wrote.""We will never forget his kind spirit, dedication, and bravery. Our deepest condolences go to his family and friends,"" the embassy wrote in a tweet.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told lawmakers Wednesday that the Biden administration is working on reopening the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.— Amanda Macias  Fri, Apr 29 20222:07 AM EDT Biden requests $33 billion for Ukraine war; Putin threatens 'lightning fast' retaliation to nations "
2022-04-30,"Bitcoin has steadily been gaining acceptance from the traditional finance and investment world in recent years but Warren Buffett is sticking to his skeptical stance on the cryptocurrency.He said at the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting Saturday that it's not a productive asset and it doesn't produce anything tangible. Despite a shift in public perception about bitcoin, Buffett still wouldn't buy it.""Whether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don't know. But the one thing I'm pretty sure of is that it doesn't produce anything,"" Buffett said. ""It's got a magic to it and people have attached magic to lots of things.""Even bitcoin enthusiasts tend to regard the cryptocurrency as a passive asset that investors buy and hold and hope to see increase in price over a long period. Buffett himself commented that there's ""nobody"" that's short bitcoin, everyone is a long-term holder.For more sophisticated crypto investors, some coins offer a way for them to use their crypto productively — either through lending, or as collateral — to create additional portfolio benefits. However, they're still young, highly speculative and haven't broken into the mainstream like bitcoin.Buffett elaborated on why he doesn't see value in bitcoin, comparing it to things that generate other types of value.

Here's where analysts see it heading next. ""If you said … for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I'll write you a check this afternoon,"" Buffett said. ""[For] $25 billion I now own 1% of the farmland. [If] you offer me 1% of all the apartment houses in the country and you want another $25 billion, I'll write you a check, it's very simple. Now if you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25 I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it? I'd have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything. The apartments are going to produce rent and the farms are going to produce food.""Investors for years have been puzzled over how to value bitcoin in part because of its potential to serve different functions. In Western markets it has been established as an investment asset, particularly in the past year as rates and inflation have been on the rise. In other markets, people still see enormous potential for its use as digital cash.""Assets, to have value, have to deliver something to somebody. And there's only one currency that's accepted. You can come up with all kinds of things — we can put up Berkshire coins... but in the end, this is money,"" he said, holding up a $20 bill. ""And there's no reason in the world why the United States government … is going to let Berkshire money replace theirs.""Both Buffett and Charlie Munger have made hostile comments toward bitcoin in the past. Most famously, Buffett said bitcoin is ""probably rat poison squared."" Munger doubled down on that sentiment Saturday.""In my life, I try and avoid things that are stupid and evil and make me look bad in comparison to somebody else – and bitcoin does all three,"" Munger said. ""In the first place, it's stupid because it's still likely to go to zero. It's evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve System ... and third, it makes us look foolish compared to the Communist leader in China. He was smart enough to ban bitcoin in China."""

Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett on Saturday put fresh money behind Activision and Chevron and doled out sharp criticism against speculation in the market.Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway's first in-person annual meeting since 2019, Buffett went so far as to say the market's turned into a ""gambling parlor.""The Oracle of Omaha also commented on inflation, building on prior remarks he has made. Buffett had previously said that inflation ""swindles"" equity investors, but noted Saturday that it ""swindles the bond investor, too. It swindles the person who keeps their cash under their mattress. It swindles almost everybody.""Buffett and his longtime partner, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, fielded shareholder questions on a broad range of issues for hours.Buffett also said that Berkshire had been increasing its stake in Activision Blizzard as part of a merger arbitrage bet that Microsoft's proposed deal to buy the video game company will close. Additionally, Berkshire revealed it had ramped up its stock bets by more than $51 billion during the first quarter amid the broader market's downturn.Munger, meanwhile, blasted stock trading app Robinhood. ""It's so easy to overdo a good idea. ... Look what happened to Robinhood from its peak to its trough. Wasn't that pretty obvious that something like that was going to happen?"" Munger said.Buffett also stressed the importance of cash as ""new forms of money"" like bitcoin pop up. ""The United States government affects that this became exchangeable for lawful money in the United States,"" Buffett said, displaying an image of an old $20 bill. ""That's what money is.""Check out CNBC's full recap below for more from the two investing legends.Buffett says people are becoming more tribalBuffett says inflation 'swindles almost everybody' Munger says 'just say no' to putting bitcoin in your retirement accountMunger says Robinhood is 'unraveling'Berkshire bought more than $51 billion of stocks during Q1′s market rout  Sat, Apr 30 20225:43 PM EDT Berkshire's formal business meeting followed nearly five hours of Q&A with Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Shareholders voted on a number of proposals at the meeting.The proposal that garnered most attention was from the non-profit National Legal and Policy Center. It calls for the company to strip Buffett of his chairman role. Shareholders voted down the proposal backed by CALPERS, the largest U.S. public pension fund.Brunel Pension requested the board of Berkshire to publish an annual assessment addressing how the company manages physical and transitional climate-related risks. The number of votes against the motion outnumbered the ones for it.One shareholder also took issue with Berkshire's climate change initiative. The proposal called for Berkshire to issue a report addressing if and how it intends to measure, disclose, and reduce the GHG emissions associated in alignment with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal, requiring net zero emissions. Shareholders voted it down.The last proposal asked Berkshire to report to shareholders on the outcomes of their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts by publishing quantitative data on workforce composition and recruitment, retention, and promotion rates of employees by gender, race, and ethnicity. The motion also failed.— Yun Li  Sat, Apr 30 20224:43 PM EDT Warren Buffett reiterated his skepticism of bitcoin on Saturday, saying he would be unwilling to buy it for even extremely low prices because it produces nothing of value.""Whether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don't know. But the one thing I'm pretty sure of is that it doesn't produce anything,"" Buffett said. ""It's got a magic to it and people have attached magics to lots of things.""Buffett listed farmland, apartment buildings — and even art — as assets that had more tangible value than bitcoin.""Assets, to have value, have to deliver something to somebody. And there's only one currency that's accepted. You can come up with all kinds of things. We can put up Berkshire coins, put up Berkshire money but in the end, this is money,"" he said, holding up a $20 bill. ""And there's no reason in the world why the United States government … is going to let Berkshire money replace theirs.""— Jesse Pound, Tanaya Macheel  Sat, Apr 30 20224:34 PM EDT Warren Buffett said people are becoming more tribal.""My general assumption — there's no way to prove it — but essentially, people are now behaving somewhat more tribal than they have for a long time,"" Buffett said.""It's fun to participate in, but it can get very dangerous when people say two plus two is five and the other says two plus two is three, you know, and they're gonna give you those answers,"" he continued.The investor said the country seems as tribal as it appeared during the 1930s when public sentiment was split in the U.S. around Franklin Roosevelt. Buffett said he was raised in a household where he and his siblings weren't served dessert until they ""said something nasty"" about Roosevelt.""I don't think it's a good development for society,"" Buffett said.— Sarah Min  Sat, Apr 30 20223:48 PM EDT In addressing a question about inflation, Buffett talked about the massive stimulus during the pandemic as a key reason for the rising prices now.""You print loads of money, and money is going to be worth less,"" Buffett said.However, he did not criticize the Federal Reserve for its actions to boost money supply and stabilize markets during the health crisis.""In my book, Jay Powell is a hero. It's very simple. He did what he had to do,"" Buffett said.— Jesse Pound  Sat, Apr 30 20223:30 PM EDT Mounting concerns about actions by the Chinese government in recent years has affected the prices of some Chinese stocks, particularly internet shares. Charlie Munger said he's willing to take on that risk for a good investment.""The reason that I invested in China is I get so much better companies at so much lower prices,"" he said. ""And I'm willing to take a little bit more risk to get into the better companies with the lower prices. Other people might reach the opposite conclusion, and everybody is more worried about China now than they were 50 years ago.""Munger's comment came in response to a question from an audience member, who asked about ""the clear dangers of investing under authoritarian regimes,"" and cited atrocities in Russia's war on Ukraine.""There's no question about the fact that the government of China has worried the investors from the United States,"" Munger said. ""There are more difficulties … dealing with the regime in China than there are the United States. And it's different, it's a long way away and they've got in their own culture in their own loyalty.""— Tanaya Macheel  Sat, Apr 30 20223:21 PM EDT The possibilities for Berkshire Hathaway are endless in the eyes of Warren Buffett, who likened the company to a work of art.""I look at Berkshire as a painting,"" Buffett said. ""It's unlimited in size; it's got an ever-expanding canvas, and I get to paint what I want.""Buffett did acknowledge that he doesn't know much about art, but added that ""other people look at paintings and they see something, then they'll see something additional later on, and they really have a different sort of perception in relation to that. To me, Berkshire is a painting, and I get to paint.""""It's in my head, and I see different things in it as I go along,"" Buffett said. ""It's satisfying.""— Fred Imbert  Sat, Apr 30 20223:18 PM EDT Warren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway has been increasing its stake in Activision Blizzard in a merger arbitrage bet that Microsoft's proposed acquisition of the video game company will close.In the fourth quarter of 2021, Berkshire first purchased about $1 billion worth of Activision Blizzard stock, in a bet the company was undervalued. Buffett has said Berkshire ""had no prior knowledge"" of Microsoft's plan to buy the company when Berkshire made its initial investment.In January, Microsoft announced intentions to buy Activision for $95 per share. Its stock closed at $75.60 per share on Friday.Buffett said he has been buying more shares of Activision since the deal was announced as the stock is trading way below Microsoft's offer. Buying at these levels will yield a bigger return if the deal closes.Buffett said Berkshire now owns about 9.5% of Activision. ""If we went over 10%, we would file a report,"" he said.""If the deal goes through, we make some money, and if the deal doesn't go through, who knows what happens,"" Buffett said.""We don't know what the Justice Department will do, we don't know what the E.U. will do, we don't know what 30 other jurisdictions will do. One thing we do know is that Microsoft has the money,"" Buffett added.—Hannah Miao  Sat, Apr 30 20222:29 PM EDT When asked about his previous comments that inflation ""swindles"" equity investors, Buffett said the damage from rising prices was much broader than that.""Inflation swindles the bond investor, too. It swindles the person who keeps their cash under their mattress. It swindles almost everybody,"" he said.Buffett pointed out that inflation also raises the amount of capital that companies need to have and that it isn't as simple as raising prices to maintain inflation-adjusted profits.The Berkshire Hathaway CEO cautioned against listening to people who claim to be able to predict the path of inflation.""The question is how much ... and the answer is nobody knows,"" Buffett said.Buffett reiterated that the best protection against the inflation is investing in your own skills.— Jesse Pound  Sat, Apr 30 20222:26 PM EDT Warren Buffett wants to make it clear that he's not the only one at Berkshire Hathaway picking stocks.""I see headlines in papers just time after time after time that say, 'Buffett's buying such and such,'"" Buffett said. ""I'm not buying such and such. Berkshire Hathaway is buying.""The investor said a stock pick may have been made by other finance professionals in his organization without Buffett's ever having heard of it.""But the headline will attract more people if it says Buffett buying this than if it says Berkshire Hathaway, and we don't know whether it is the people that work for him, the headline is designed to bring people into the story,"" Buffett said.""The easiest thing to do is basically shut up and not have a bunch of people facing consequences they didn't ask for in the first place,"" he said.— Sarah Min  Sat, Apr 30 20221:18 PM EDT A trip to the New York Stock Exchange when he was 9 years old was inspiring for Warren Buffett, who is known to have started investing when he was 11 years old.""I went to the New York Stock Exchange, I was in awe of it,"" Buffett said. ""I got very interested in technical analysis and charted stocks and did all kinds of crazy things, did hours and hours and hours and saved money to buy other stocks and tried shorting. I just did everything.""The investor bought a stock at 11 after spending his childhood reading books on the subject from the library and in his father's office. He said his approach to investing later changed completely when he was 19 or 20 years old after reading one particular book passage in what he said must have been Benjamin Graham's ""The Intelligent Investor.""""I looked at this book and I saw one paragraph and it told me I've been doing everything wrong. I just had the whole approach wrong,"" Buffett said. — Sarah Min  Sat, Apr 30 20221:08 PM EDT Charlie Munger pointed to commission-free brokerage Robinhood as an example of a good idea that got ""grossly overdone.""The stock fell below $10 per share last week after the company announced layoffs and a decline in active users. It debuted at $38 per share in July 2021.""Look what happened to Robinhood, from its peak to its trough,"" Munger said. ""Wasn't it pretty obvious something like that was going to happen?""Munger said the ""hidden kickbacks"" of that business model were ""disgusting."" Robinhood makes money from a practice known as a payment for order flow. It receives some of the spread on trades the company forwards to larger trading houses.""It's unraveling. God is getting just,"" Munger said.— Jesse Pound  Sat, Apr 30 202212:51 PM EDT Charlie Munger is still down on bitcoin. He responded to an audience member question asking what single stock they would invest in given how high inflation has been rising.The Berkshire executives didn't say where they would put their money, but Munger was clear about where he wouldn't invest: bitcoin.""When you have your own retirement account, and your friendly adviser suggests you put all the money in into bitcoin, just say no,"" he said.Munger's answer was a thinly veiled reference to big news from Fidelity this week, which will now allow employees to put bitcoin into their employee-sponsored retirement accounts.Munger and Buffett have both long been critics of bitcoin, which has become increasingly attractive to certain investors for its potential as an inflation hedge.— Tanaya Macheel  Sat, Apr 30 202212:23 PM EDT Warren Buffett said he has never figured out how to time the markets.""We haven't the faintest idea what the stock market was gonna do when it opens on Monday,"" Buffett said in response to an audience question.""I don't think we've ever made a decision where either one of us has either said or been thinking we should buy or sell based on what the market is going to do, or for that matter, on what the economy's going to do. We don't know,"" he continued.The Oracle of Omaha said he often gets misplaced credit for the stock winners he's picked over the years, pointing out he's also missed out on some big opportunities as well. Buffett said he failed to make some big purchases in the early days of the pandemic. In a single day in March 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 12.9%, its worst day since 1987.Instead, Buffett adheres to a value investing strategy, or picking stocks with attractive valuations, instead of focusing on the vagaries of the stock market.""We have not been good at timing,"" Buffett said. ""We've been reasonably good at figuring out when we were getting enough for our money. And we had no idea when we bought anything, but we always hoped it would the down for a while so we could buy more. ... I mean, that stuff, you could you could learn in fourth grade.""— Sarah Min  Sat, Apr 30 202212:06 PM EDT Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who runs all of the conglomerate's insurance businesses, lamented about how Geico has fallen behind rival Progressive in the car insurance business.""Each one have their plusses and minuses, but having said that, there's no question that recently Progressive has done a much better job than Geico … both in terms of margins and in terms of growth,"" Jain said.""There are a number of causes for that, but I think the biggest culprit is as far as Geico is concerned … is telematics,"" he added. Telematics refers to putting a device on a car that tracks driving patterns, in exchange for a lower insurance rate.""Progressive has been on the telematics bandwagon for more than 10 years. Geico, until recently, wasn't involved in telematics,"" Jain said. ""It's a long journey, but the journey has started, and the initial results are promising. It will take a while, but my hope is that in the next year or two, Geico will be positioned to catch up with Progressive.""Jain's comments came after Berkshire reported earlier in the day a massive earnings drop in its insurance underwriting business for the first quarter.— Fred Imbert  Sat, Apr 30 202211:54 AM EDT Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger had some stern words in response to a proposal to oust CEO Warren Buffett as chairman.""It's the most ridiculous criticism I ever heard,"" Munger said.""It's like Odysseus would come back from winning the battle of Troy and so forth and some guy would say, 'I don't like the way you were holding your spear when you won that battle,'"" he added, referencing ancient Greek epic ""The Odyssey.""The California Public Employees' Retirement System, or CalPERS, the biggest public pension fund in the U.S., earlier this month said it would vote in favor of a shareholder proposal to remove Buffett from his chairman role while remaining CEO. The proposal's aim stems from concerns about corporate governance with one person holding dual roles.""Some guy that's never run any business, doesn't know anything — I don't think too much of this activity,"" Munger said.—Hannah Miao  Sat, Apr 30 202211:52 AM EDT Munger said today's stock market has become ""almost a mania of speculation."" His comment alluded to both high frequency algorithmic trading and access new investors have that intensified during the pandemic.""We have computers with algorithms trading against other computers,"" Munger said. ""We've got people who know nothing about stocks, being advised by stockbrokers who know even less.""I understand the commission though,"" Buffett joked.After Munger likened the activity to a casino, where people play craps and roulette, Buffett expanded on the comparison.  ""People and traders' poker chips are pulling the handle,"" he said. ""They've got the system set up so that if you want to buy a three-day call on the stock you can do it and they make more money selling you calls than if you buy stock, so they teach you calls. Nobody's going around selling calls on farms. That's why markets do crazy things. Occasionally Berkshire gets a chance to do something. It's not because we're smarter. … we're sane, and that's the main requirement in this business.""— Tanaya Macheel  Sat, Apr 30 202211:37 AM EDT Warren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway is open to investing in businesses anywhere, not just in the U.S.""We have so much trouble finding good ideas that we can't afford to ignore any,"" Buffett said. ""But they do have to be sizable."" Buffett said while he does seek out new investments, he prefers to be approached proactively.""We'll pay any price, climb any hills to find businesses, but we actually prefer when they fall into our lap,"" Buffett said.— Hannah Miao  Sat, Apr 30 202211:35 AM EDT Buffett said he wants Berkshire Hathaway to be in a ""position to operate"" should the economy stop.""We want Berkshire Hathaway to be there and in a position to operate if the economy stops,"" Buffett said. ""And that can always happen, it can always happen.""Buffett played a significant role during the Great Recession, providing capital during a pivotal moment to companies such as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. The move drew criticism from those who disapproved of the support of big banks.The billionaire investor made those remarks while also praising the Federal Reserve's role during the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic.""The Federal Reserve has not gone,"" Buffett said. He added the Fed will ""do whatever is necessary. ... That's what happened in 2008 and 2009, and that's what happened in 2020, and you'll hope it happens again next time.""— Sarah Min  Sat, Apr 30 202211:30 AM EDT Ahead of the shareholder meeting, the executives of several Berkshire portfolio companies told CNBC how inflation was hitting their businesses.One of those executives was Jim Weber, CEO of Brooks Running.Weber said it was tough to raise prices for Brooks' products but that he thinks some of the cost pressures could cool soon.""We don't have unlimited pricing power, but we have taken selective price increases where we think we can. But our whole industry is so competitive. It's a big market place. ... I do believe in the supply chain that costs are going to mediate a bit,"" Weber said.Read more about the impact of inflation on companies such as Nebraska Furniture Mart and Dairy Queen.— Jesse Pound  Sat, Apr 30 202211:25 AM EDT Buffett scooped up 14% of oil giant Occidental Petroleum, worth more than $7 billion, in two weeks during March.He pointed out that the stake was even larger when accounting for the index fund providers who own a huge chunk of the company.""That's not investment. You're not buying from [investors]. I find it just incredible. You couldn't do that with Berkshire. ... Overwhelmingly, large companies in America, they became poker chips,"" Buffett said.""That enabled us, in a two-week period, to buy 14% of a business that's been around for decades,"" Buffett said. ""Imagine trying to [buy] 14% of the farms in this country. 14% of the apartment houses. 14% of the auto dealerships, or just anything, when already 40% were locked up some other place. It defies anything Charlie and I have seen, and we've seen a lot.""The legendary investor said that the short-term volatility earlier this year fueled by ""gambling mentality"" allowed him to find good long-term opportunities.— Yun Li, Jesse Pound  Sat, Apr 30 202211:16 AM EDT In his annual chairman letter to shareholders in February, Warren Buffett said there is ""little that excites us"" in the market. But soon after, he put Berkshire's money to work.Berkshire at the beginning of March revealed a big stake in oil giant Occidental Petroleum. At the beginning of April, Berkshire announced a major stake in tech hardware stock HP. Berkshire's first-quarter filing revealed the company significantly increased its bet on Chevron.""We found some things we prefer to owning Treasury bills,"" quipped Berkshire vice chairman and Buffett's right-hand man Charlie Munger.—Hannah Miao  Sat, Apr 30 202211:12 AM EDT Warren Buffett warned shareholders about ""new forms of money"" as he recalled the financial crisis of 2008 and said Berkshire Hathaway will ""always have a lot of cash on hand.""Buffett did not explicitly identify bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, though he has made headlines for calling bitcoin ""rat poison"" in the past and has said it has no unique value. Charlie Munger has also spoken with hostility about it.""The United States government affects that this became exchangeable for lawful money in the United States,"" Buffett said, displaying an image of an old $20 bill.""That's what money is,"" he added. ""It may turn out that it becomes worth dramatically less at purchasing power. It can become almost like paper money as it has in many countries. But that when people tell you that they're reaching [for] new forms of money, this is the only thing that will pay bills.""— Tanaya Macheel  Sat, Apr 30 202210:56 AM EDT Warren Buffett has a long history of teasing investment bankers and their institutions – saying that they encourage mergers and spinoffs to reap fees, rather than improve companies. Today, he noted that Berkshire Hathaway would always be cash-rich, and in times of need, would be ""better than the banks"" at extending credit lines to companies in need. While Buffett was talking, someone was shouting from the crowd in the CHI Center. It was unclear what the audience member was said. ""Was that a banker screaming?"" Buffett joked.—Hugh Son  Sat, Apr 30 202210:51 AM EDT Berkshire bought more than $51 billion worth of stocks during the first quarter's market turmoil, including sizable investments in Chevron, HP and Occidental. The buying at the start of the year marked a sharp reversal from 2021 that saw $7.4 billion of net sales in stocks.The S&P 500 suffered a 5% sell-off in the first quarter, posting its worst quarter since the start of the pandemic. The rout continued in April with the equity benchmark down another 8.8% amid fears of surging inflation and rising rates.— Yun Li  Sat, Apr 30 202210:22 AM EDT Warren Buffett appeared on stage at the CHI Health Center with his right hand man Charlie Munger by his side. They were welcomed by a round of applause from shareholders. Also on the stage were vice chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.""It feels good to be back,"" the chairman and CEO said. ""The two of us are 190 years old, and I really think you're entitled, if you're the owner of a company and got two guys — 98 and 91 — running the company, you're entitled to actually see them in person.""— Yun Li, Fred Imbert  Sat, Apr 30 202210:16 AM EDT Berkshire Hathaway counts musician and business mogul Jimmy Buffett among its long-term shareholders. The ""Margaritaville"" restaurant chain owner told CNBC he first bought shares of Berkshire Hathaway about 25 years ago.""Have you held onto them this entire time?"" Becky Quick asked.""Never sold anything,"" Buffett said. The singer-songwriter said he first came to know Berkshire chairman and CEO Warren Buffett when tracing his family lineage. While the Buffetts have no relation, the two have remained friends.Jimmy Buffett designed a pontoon boat manufactured by Berkshire subsidiary Forest River that debuted Friday at the ""Berkshire Bazaar of Bargains."" Warren Buffett gave a sales pitch for the party boat in his annual shareholder letter in February, calling the musician ""'Cousin' Jimmy Buffett.""""Your bargain-hunting chairman will be buying a boat for his family's use,"" the chairman said.—Hannah Miao  Sat, Apr 30 202210:09 AM EDT Warren Buffett's career has been a testament to that the fact that, over the long-term, value investing can produce major gains.From the start of 1965 through the end of 2021, the per-share market value of Berkshire Hathaway had an average compound annual gain of 20.1%, according to the firm's annual letter. That is nearly double the S&P 500's 10.5%, including dividends. Loading chart... While Buffett has built a big lead over many decades, he has had continued success in recent years. Since 2010, Berkshire has outpaced the S&P 500 in eight calendar years. That is on track to happen again in 2022.—Jesse Pound  Sat, Apr 30 202210:02 AM EDT Many investors might be surprised to learn that there are only seven analysts covering Berkshire Hathaway at Wall Street's major equity research firms. Among these analysts, six of them have a hold-equivalent rating and only one has a buy rating, according to CNBC Research.The primary reason for the lack of Berkshire bulls is the conglomerate's stellar performance this year, leading many to believe the good news has been priced in to the stock. Secondly, some analysts were expecting a slowdown in buybacks following a record year of share repurchases. — Yun Li  Sat, Apr 30 20229:59 AM EDT Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting draws tens of thousands of attendees to Omaha, Nebraska, but the event has humble beginnings.Warren Buffet took control of the company in 1965, and the shareholder meetings continued to be held in Massachusetts through 1972, according to the Omaha World-Herald. When Buffet moved the meetings to Omaha, just about a dozen people attended the first several years, according to The Wall Street Journal.In 1985, the meeting drew 250 attendees. In 1989, a thousand people came. In 1996, the event had 5,000 attendees. By the 2000s, the meeting rose to the prominence of tens of thousands of participants. The legendary event is often referred to as a pilgrimage for those in the world of business and finance. In fact, the meeting is most commonly dubbed ""Woodstock for Capitalists.""It's unclear exactly when the name first came about, but the earliest reference to Woodstock in Berkshire's annual letters came in 1997, recapping the 1996 company's performance.Buffet referred to the event as ""our capitalist's version of Woodstock -the Berkshire Annual Meeting,"" he wrote to shareholders. — Hannah Miao  Sat, Apr 30 20229:56 AM EDT Saturday's ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" kicked off, with big shareholders, CEOs and other investors flooding the event center, including first-time attendee Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan.Activision CEO Bobby Kotick was also in attendance, as well as Apple CEO Tim Cook.— Tanaya Macheel  Sat, Apr 30 20229:46 AM EDT Buffett has a long history of favoring banks. He helped rescue Salomon Brothers in the 1990s and swooped in again to help the industry by injecting $5 billion into Goldman Sachs in 2008 and another $5 billion into Bank of America in 2011.So investors took note when he unloaded stakes in JPMorgan Chase, Goldman and Wells Fargo in 2020, trimming his portfolio to U.S.-centric retail lenders including Bank of America and U.S. Bancorp.The fact that he has stayed away this year — despite loosening his purse strings for a string of recent deals and amid a pullback in bank stocks – could be a bad sign for the broader economy, some say.""What this is telling you is, he thinks we need to batten down the hatches because we're looking at a long cycle of inflation and probably stagnation,"" said Phillip Phan, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School.—Hugh Son  Sat, Apr 30 20229:43 AM EDT Warren Buffett's long-term track record is hard to argue against, but his investments are not immune to short-term volatility in the markets.Here's how Berkshire's top holdings performed in a rough April for the broader stock market.Apple: -9.7%Bank of America: -13.4%American Express: -6.6%Chevron: -3.8%— Jesse Pound  Sat, Apr 30 20229:39 AM EDT Shareholders on Friday pregamed Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting with a shopping carnival featuring goods sold by the conglomerate's holdings.The event is a tradition each year known as the ""Berkshire Bazaar of Bargains."" Only those with a shareholder credential can participate and shop at a discount in the CHI Health Center.Exhibits included toy trains mimicking BNSF Railway rolling stock, Berkshire chocolate coins from See's Candies and Buffett-branded Brooks athleisure. —Yun Li and Hannah Miao  Sat, Apr 30 20229:35 AM EDT Before Berkshire's recent buying spree, the Omaha-based conglomerate had been a net seller of stocks for the past five quarters as Buffett saw few bargains among surging equities.In the second quarter of 2020, Buffett dumped his entirety of airline stakes, north of $4 billion then, as he believed the pandemic changed the industry fundamentally. — Yun Li  Sat, Apr 30 20229:27 AM EDT Shares of Berkshire Hathaway have been one of the stock market's best bets in 2022.The B-class shares of Warren Buffett's conglomerate ended April up nearly 8% for the year. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has shed more than 13%. Loading chart... The gain for Buffett has come despite a decline of roughly 11% for Apple, Berkshire's top holding. The firm has benefited from big gains in energy stocks such Chevron and Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire also has large position in Coca-Cola, which has gained 9% in 2022 despite increasing concerns about a potential recession.Despite the overall gains, Berkshire was not immune to the market downturn in April. The B-class shares dropped 8.5% over the past month.—Jesse Pound  Sat, Apr 30 20229:15 AM EDT Berkshire Hathaway's first-quarter earnings declined year over year, with the stock market turmoil and weaker insurance results hurting results.The company reported $5.46 billion in earnings, down from $11.71 billion in the year-earlier period for a decline of about 53%.Because of Berkshire's large investment holdings, earnings can be volatile quarter to quarter. Buffett has long said investors should focus on Berkshire's operating earnings, which were mostly flat year over year at $7.04 billion, as a better indicator of the firm's performance.The pace of stock buybacks also slowed, with Berkshire spending $3.2 billion on repurchases compared with $6.9 billion in the prior quarter. The company ended March with  $106.3 billion in cash.—Jesse Pound  Sat, Apr 30 20229:06 AM EDT Shareholders lined up Saturday morning to enter CHI Health Center for Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. —Yun Li and Hannah Miao  Sat, Apr 30 20228:56 AM EDT Berkshire's annual shareholder arrives at a time of heightened worry in the stock market.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished a rough April at their lows for the year.

2022-04-30,"Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger blasted stock trading app Robinhood on Saturday, saying the company is now ""unraveling.""""It's so easy to overdo a good idea. ... Look what happened to Robinhood from its peak to its trough. Wasn't that pretty obvious that something like that was going to happen?"" Munger said at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting Saturday.Munger lambasted what he characterized as Robinhood's ""short-term gambling and big commissions and hidden kickbacks and so on.""Robinhood does not charge users commission and generates a majority of its revenue from ""payment for order flow,"" the back-end payment brokerages receive for directing clients' trades to market makers. ""It was disgusting,"" Munger said. ""Now it's unraveling. God is getting just."" Robinhood went public last July and shares are down 88% from their August 2021 high.The company rose to prominence during the pandemic and played a key role in some massive short squeezes last year, as retail investors flocked to the app to push meme stock prices higher and inflict pain on short sellers betting against the stocks.Munger in February 2021 amid a wild trading rush first criticized Robinhood for its practices, calling the app's business model a ""dirty way of making money.""The company on Thursday reported a decrease in users and a wider-than-expected loss for the first quarter. Earlier in the week, Robinhood announced it would cut about 9% of full-time employees.Robinhood responded to Munger's comments, saying the vice chairman does not understand the trading platform.""It is tiresome witnessing Mr. Munger mischaracterize a platform and customer base he knows nothing about. ... He should just say what he really means: unless you look, think, and act like him, you cannot and should not be an investor. We're happy to share our educational tools, as it also seems he is lost on digital currencies,"" Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay, Robinhood head of public policy communications, said in an email to CNBC.Munger's remarks echoed comments from Berkshire Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett earlier in the meeting ripping on Wall Street for turning the stock market into a ""gambling parlor.""""Is it wise to criticize people at all?"" Buffett asked.""Probably not, but I can't help it,"" Munger said.Check out all of the CNBC Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting coverage here."
2022-05-02,"Some of the biggest names in bitcoin — including Jack Dorsey, Tom Lee, and Michael Saylor — have co-authored a letter to the EPA to refute claims made by House Democrats calling on the agency to investigate the environmental effects of crypto mining.Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) mining model, meaning that miners around the world run high-powered computers to simultaneously create new bitcoin and validate transactions. Some of the biggest names in bitcoin — including Jack Dorsey, Tom Lee, and Michael Saylor — have banded together to refute claims made by House Democrats calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the environmental effects of crypto mining.Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) mining model, meaning that miners around the world run high-powered computers to simultaneously create new bitcoin and validate transactions. Proof-of-work mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity, has virtually become synonymous with bitcoin, though ethereum — at least for another few months — still uses this method to secure its network.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), along with nearly two dozen House legislators, wrote to the EPA last week asking that the regulatory body ensure mining companies are in compliance with the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, citing ""serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.""In a rebuttal letter sent to EPA Chief Michael Regan Monday morning, a mix of bitcoin miners and industry experts — as well as firms like Benchmark Capital, Fidelity Investments, and Fortress Investment Group — make the case that House Democrats got a lot wrong in their messaging about the fundamentals of proof-of-work mining.For one, the letter takes issue with lawmakers conflating data centers with power generation facilities.The rebuttal letter says, data centers that contain “miners'' are no different than data centers owned and operated by Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. According to the letter, each is just a building in which electricity powers IT equipment to run computing workloads.""Regulating what data centers allow their computers to do would be a massive shift in policy in the United States,"" the letter reads. ""They're confusing the public,"" said Darin Feinstein, co-founder of cryptocurrency mining operator Core Scientific — and one of the primary authors on the letter. ""The pollution comes from the energy generation source, and all data centers buy electricity off-site, upstream.""Feinstein said if the EPA wants to regulate energy generation, there are already channels in place to regulate energy generation facilities on a federal, state, and local level.""It would be very unusual for the EPA to regulate the kind of computation that's occurring within a data center. That's clearly outside of their remit,"" Castle Island Venture's Nic Carter, who helped to write the rebuttal, told CNBC.""It doesn't make any sense to ask the EPA to care about what kind of computation is being done,"" said Carter.While the EPA does regulate power plants, very few PoW mining companies actually own the power production, according to the rebuttal.""The letter makes it sound like there's a bunch of these vertically integrated miners like Stronghold and Greenidge...but that's a minuscule portion of overall hashrate,"" continued Carter, referring to an industry term used to describe the computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network.Huffman and his fellow House colleagues also take issue with the specialized computing hardware, which they claim creates ""major electronic waste challenges"" as millions of devices quickly become obsolete, leading to large amounts of electronic waste.The letter cites estimates that bitcoin mining alone produces 30,700 tons of electronic waste annually. ""The industry needs to be held accountable for this waste and discouraged from creating it,"" the letter argues.The note to the EPA this morning refutes the e-waste claim, saying that legislators cited a widely criticized research study that makes bold assumptions about the depreciation timeline for mining rigs. The letter says that the assumption of a 1.3-year period for depreciation is ""extremely short"" and lawmakers infer that the entire fleet of rigs are periodically junked.It is unclear whether the EPA will wade into the larger debate around proof-of-work mining. The agency did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."
2022-05-02,"The cryptocurrency mining process is underpinned by something known as ""proof of work."" And it uses up an incredibly large amount of energy.Governments around the world are growing concerned. Some countries, such as China, have gone so far as to ban crypto mining outright.In northern Sweden, Canadian firm Hive Blockchain is relying on a local hydropower plant to power its crypto mining facility in the region. BODEN, Sweden — Tucked away in snowy Swedish Lapland is a modern-day gold mine. But instead of picks and shovels, it's filled with thousands of computers.These machines, known as mining rigs, are working around the clock to find new units of cryptocurrency — in this case, ethereum, the second-largest token globally.To do so, they must compete with others around the world to find the answer to a complex math puzzle, which grows in difficulty as more and more computers, known as ""miners,"" join the network. The aim is to ensure the security of the system and prevent fraud. The whole process is underpinned by something known as ""proof of work."" And it uses up an incredibly large amount of energy. Bitcoin, the world's biggest digital currency, also uses this framework. It now consumes as much energy as entire countries.Governments around the world are growing concerned. Some countries, such as China, have gone so far as to ban crypto mining outright. The mine in question, a warehouse-like building located in the military town of Boden, houses 15,000 of these mining rigs in total. At 86,000 square feet, it's bigger than a standard soccer pitch.The facility is run by Hive Blockchain, a Canadian firm that focuses on using green and renewable energy to mine crypto. Hive's Swedish operation is powered by a local hydropower plant in Boden, in the north of the country. The region is renowned for its surplus of cheap, renewable electricity.""In the north of Sweden, 100% of the power is either hydro power-based or wind power-based,"" Johan Eriksson, an advisor at Hive, said. ""It is 100% renewable.""Eriksson says crypto miners are using excess energy capacity that would have otherwise been wasted — in other words, it's not required by households in the region.But the vast amount of power needed to run operations like Hive's has alarmed officials.Finansinspektionen, the Swedish finance watchdog, is calling on the European Union to ban crypto mining due to its huge energy usage.""Extensive usage of renewable energy for crypto-asset mining could jeopardize Sweden's climate goals,"" Victoria Ericsson, a spokeswoman for the agency, told CNBC. Development of electric vehicles, batteries and fossil-free steel should take priority over crypto mining, she said.""There are alternative consensus mechanisms to proof of work available that would significantly reduce the energy consumption,"" Ericsson added.""We do not regard it as reasonable to exclude Bitcoin and the crypto world from the work being undertaken by other sectors of the economy to improve energy efficiency."" Edinburgh-based crypto firm Zumo is part of the Crypto Climate Accord, a coalition of companies that aims to achieve net-zero emissions in the crypto industry by 2030.Kirsteen Harrison, Zumo's climate policy advisor, says the initiative is working on a piece of software that would be able to verify the source of energy used in mining crypto as renewable.""There's quite a lot of trials going on with that at the moment,"" she said. ""If that's successful, then hopefully that will filter out to the rest of the sector."" Simply decarbonizing the production of cryptocurrencies may not be enough though, according to some activists. Greenpeace and other environmental groups are calling for the bitcoin community to replace its proof of work mechanism with one called ""proof of stake"" instead. That would remove the huge computational cost of verifying new crypto transactions.Ethereum is currently in the middle of a lengthy transition to proof of stake, a move advocates say would reduce its energy consumption by over 99%. And other cryptos, like cardano and solan, already operate on proof of stake networks.But, as Harrison explains, moving a cryptocurrency like bitcoin away from proof of work is easier said than done.""I don't believe that there's an option to do away with proof of work, precisely because not one single player has control of the system,"" she says. Although Hive and other crypto firms are increasingly turning to green energy to fuel their operations, there are plenty of others who aren't yet on board with the shift to renewables. Some are deliberately using gas that would otherwise be flared to generate electricity for crypto mining, for example.Since China banned crypto mining, bitcoin's backers had hoped this would make the cryptocurrency greener.But a peer-reviewed study released in February found bitcoin mining only got dirtier in 2021, with miners actually flocking to regions that more reliant on coal and other fossil fuels, including Kazakhstan and southern U.S. states like Texas and Kentucky.Part of the problem is the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. While there are various groups now claiming to represent the industry, bitcoin has no central authority and anyone can participate in the network."
2022-05-02,"It doesn't look like legendary investor Warren Buffett will be adding bitcoin to his portfolio any time soon.Asked Saturday at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting if he had changed his famously negative views on bitcoin or crypto, the 91-year-old investor didn't mince his words.Buffett began his answer by saying that if all the attendees in the room owned ""all the farmland in the United States"" or ""all the apartments in the country"" and they offered him a 1% stake for $25 billion, he would write them a check on the spot. But he wouldn't do the same for bitcoin and its over-$700 billion market cap. ""If you ... owned all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn't take it,"" Buffett said. ""Because what would I do with it? I'll have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything.""He described his views on farmland and rental properties versus bitcoin as ""the difference between productive assets and something that depends on the next guy paying you more than the last guy got.""""The apartments are going to produce rent and the farms are going to produce food,"" he said. ""If I've got all the bitcoin, I'm back wherever [anonymous bitcoin founder Satoshi] was.""He attributed the allure of bitcoin to a type of ""magic"" that draws investors.""Whether it goes up or down in the next year or five years or 10 years, I don't know. But one thing I'm sure of is that it doesn't multiply, it doesn't produce anything,"" he said. ""It's got a magic to it, and people have attached magic to lots of things.""Buffett has long been against cryptocurrencies. He told CNBC in 2018 that ""they will come to a bad ending"" and said that Berkshire Hathaway will ""never have a position in them.""""I get into enough trouble with the things I think I know something about,"" he said at the time.

2022-05-03,"Cryptocurrency money is flowing to both Republicans and Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections as the industry tries to grow its political clout.FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is largely bankrolling a $14 million PAC called Protect Our Future""I truly think we're going to see an orange wave on Washington,"" one PAC founder says. This year's midterm elections aren't just about red versus blue. Crypto investors are trying to turn politics orange. That's the color adopted by bitcoin's most ardent supporters, who have driven an influx of cash into campaigns across the country. Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, is the primary force behind the political action committee Protect Our Future. The group has raised $14 million — most of it from the billionaire Bankman-Fried — and could tip the scales in House races in Ohio and Oregon.Other FTX executives are involved in GMI PAC, which has already brought in $6 million and plans to spend $20 million this cycle. HODLpac, which reported nearly $230,000 in contributions, rates candidates' credibility on issues important to crypto investors.Elections are a new arena for an industry built on distrust of government and decentralized control. But the battle over the federal infrastructure bill last summer — which included new IRS reporting requirements for the industry — galvanized crypto executives and enthusiasts alike. The industry quickly built up its lobbying machine on Capitol Hill, and it hopes to harness that same energy for the elections.  ""The crypto industry is proud to support elected officials who believe in the true potential of the crypto economy in the U.S.,"" said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, a crypto trade group. ""And we're not shy, as an industry, to say and support what we value, and that includes political giving."" The primary election in Ohio on Tuesday will be one of the first tests of the industry's influence. State Treasurer Josh Mandel is one of the leading contenders for the open Senate seat — and a strident bitcoin supporter.Last year, he sold his stocks and instead put the money into cryptocurrency. He has a five-star rating from HODLpac and spoke at a massive bitcoin conference in Miami last month.""Ohio must be a pro-God, pro-family, pro-bitcoin state,"" he tweeted in December. ""I promise we will be."" Mandel is one of the four upstart candidates — two Republicans and two Democrats across the country — endorsed by the Financial Freedom PAC, which launched earlier this month. The PAC focuses exclusively on bitcoin and is on track to raise at least $1 million by the end of the cycle.""We're very passionate groups of people — people who were frankly disaffected by politics and by the government and by existing institutions,"" said Grant McCarty, one of the group's founders. ""We want them to realize that if they use their voice — if they play in D.C. in this way — that we can actually get politicians to represent their interests.""Big money is also flowing into the matchup between incumbent Rep. Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, and progressive challenger Nina Turner. The two faced off last year in a special election for the Cleveland-area 11th District that ended with Brown capturing 50.2 percent of the vote, 6 percentage points more than Turner.This year, Protect Our Future is bolstering Brown's bid with more than $1 million in radio, digital and TV ads — a windfall for a candidate whose campaign has raised $4 million. Turner responded to the outside spending in a tweet: ""See, there is a clear difference in this race. One of the candidates in this primary is for sale. I am not for sale. Cleveland is not for sale.""Brown spokesperson Darryle Torbert emphasized that the campaign is not affiliated with Protect Our Future, but said Brown is monitoring the White House's moves on crypto policy.""Commonsense regulation of the cryptocurrency market would not only help to better protect consumers but also bring greater stability and certainty to the market, allowing it to continue to grow in the years to come,"" he said.Protect Our Future is also plowing money into the congressional race in Oregon's 6th District. The PAC has spent more than $7 million on behalf of Democratic candidate Carrick Flynn, according to federal elections filings. The group has said its support is based on his expertise in pandemic preparedness rather than his stance on crypto.Still, the money has generated enough momentum that establishment players such as the House Majority PAC — an outside group affiliated with and supportive of House Democrats — are now backing his run, as well.  The crypto community is not just boosting its supporters. It is also going after politicians who criticize the industry. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., is one of the top targets.He has compared crypto to the subprime mortgages that led to the 2008 financial crisis. He recently sponsored a bill with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., that would curb the use of cryptocurrencies to prevent the evasion of sanctions on Russia.""All the money and power is on the other side. You don't have a PAC. You don't have gangs of lobbyists,"" he told a top Treasury official during a congressional hearing in February.""What you do have is the credibility of knowing that the Treasury Department and your affiliated agencies are putting the national interest over the pecuniary interest of certain investors,"" he added, in discussing efforts to stop the use of crypto to get around sanctions.In response, Financial Freedom PAC is endorsing one of his primary challengers, Aarika Rhodes, in a longshot bid to unseat the 13-term congressperson. Rhodes is an elementary school teacher who believes bitcoin can help to democratize the financial system.Earlier this year, she hosted a conversation on Twitter with the social media company's former CEO and crypto advocate Jack Dorsey.It's an uphill battle, but McCarty said electing just one bitcoin advocate to Congress this November would be a win — and enough to generate momentum for the years to come. ""This is not a short-term game for us. The fight for Bitcoin is going to be a marathon, not a sprint. 2022 is just the beginning,"" he said. ""In 2024, I truly think we're going to see an orange wave on Washington."" "

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Tuesday that it will almost double its staff responsible for protecting investors in cryptocurrency markets.The regulator's Crypto Assets and Cyber team, a unit of the SEC's broader Enforcement division, will increase its head count by 20 for a total of 50 dedicated positions.Wall Street's top law enforcer said that the 20 additions will include investigative staff attorneys, trial lawyers and fraud analysts. Both SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal applauded the hires as overdue and key to regulating one of Wall Street's newest and most popular industries. The SEC's crypto unit ""has successfully brought dozens of cases against those seeking to take advantage of investors in crypto markets,"" Gensler said in a statement. ""By nearly doubling the size of this key unit, the SEC will be better equipped to police wrongdoing in the crypto markets while continuing to identify disclosure and controls issues with respect to cybersecurity.""Grewal added that individual retail investors tend to comprise the bulk of victims of crypto-related securities fraud. Cyber threats continue to pose ""existential"" risks to the U.S. financial system, he added.""The bolstered Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit will be at the forefront of protecting investors and ensuring fair and orderly markets in the face of these critical challenges,"" Grewal said in a statement.The announcement comes nearly eight months after Gensler lamented to lawmakers that his agency needed more staff to handle the volume of new and complex financial technologies.Gensler in September told Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., that the regulator could use ""a lot more people"" to assess and regulate some 6,000 new digital projects.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., asked Gensler in September. ""Why do you impose your personal preferences about cultural issues and social issues on companies, and therefore their customers and their workers?""Gensler has said that investors themselves want more clarity from the companies about the risks they face from climate change and bad actors who seek to steal digital assets."
2022-05-03,"Could the latest approval for a bitcoin futures product hold the key to what it would take for the SEC to approve a long-coveted spot-bitcoin ETF?Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light to fund firm Teucrium to issue a bitcoin futures exchange-traded product.Sal Gilbertie, CEO of Teucrium, pointed out a footnote in the regulator's approval letter to CNBC's ETF Edge.   In reference to the potential for fraud and manipulation it reads: ""If, however, an exchange proposing to list and trade a spot bitcoin [product] identifies… the regulated market with which it has a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement, the exchange could overcome the Commission's concern…""Gilbertie explains, ""They've clearly spelled out that if the crypto exchanges… institute those comprehensive surveillance agreements with the ETF listing exchanges, they will get a crypto spot ETF.""But there-in lies the fundamental problem. Gilbertie concludes, ""I don't think it's gonna happen because I don't see why those big crypto exchanges would want to centralize when the whole industry is made up around a decentralized concept.""Crypto firm Grayscale, one of the biggest proponents of a spot-bitcoin ETF and creator of the Grayscale Bitcoin, recently threatened to sue to SEC over the issue.But Gilbertie was not convinced of the effectiveness a such a tack arguing, ""It would take years. The SEC is not going to succumb to that kind of pressure… unless you get a change in leadership who have a sea-change in how they are looking at things… they want to see crypto coins completely surveilled… I don't see how they're going to back down from that when they're all about investor protection.""Disclaimer"

Newsom's executive order on blockchain aligns with the Biden administration proposal in March.The directive spells out a road map on regulatory and consumer protections.The governor is calling on California to examine using blockchain solutions in state operations. Tech investors and businesses in California have been betting on crypto for well over a decade. Now, the governor of the U.S. state with the largest economy is joining the party.California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Wednesday on cryptocurrencies, laying out a road map for regulatory and consumer protections and examining ways the state can take advantage of blockchain technologies and digital assets.""Of the 800 blockchain businesses in North America, about a quarter of them are in California, dramatically more than any other state,"" Dee Dee Myers, senior advisor to Newsom and director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, told CNBC. ""We've heard from so many that they want to be here, and we want to help them do that responsibly.""Newsom is directing the state's business and economic development office to work in collaboration with California's Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency and the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.The order is designed to ""create a transparent and consistent business environment for companies operating in blockchain, including crypto assets and related financial technologies, that harmonizes federal and California laws, balances the benefits and risks to consumers, and incorporates California values, such as equity, inclusivity, and environmental protection."" The agencies will submit its findings and recommend next steps. According to the order, it will ""reflect consultation with relevant state agencies regarding the forthcoming federal reports on the relationship of crypto assets to priorities in energy, climate, and preventing criminal activity.""Myers said the agencies plan to hold roundtables and listening sessions with industry leaders, consumer advocates and even critics.""The opportunities are almost endless,"" Myers said. ""We can do things like remove middlemen from transactions involving real estate or even automobiles. We can use it to protect people's identity and provide benefits to people through government services. If we're selling carbon offsets, we can make sure the same forest isn't being sold twice and that there's some record that's transparent.""Under California's plan, the order would align with the Biden administration's proposal in March to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies.Some 37 states have pending legislation on cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In February, New Hampshire issued an executive order to propose new bitcoin laws. Aaron Klein, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the most compelling part of Newsom's plan is the exploration of ways to find ""crypto solutions to existing problems.""""California seems to be trying to walk a tightrope between moving the state forward to embrace new technology while making sure that consumers and investors are properly protected,"" Klein said.Newsom is sure to encounter skeptics, given concerns about the security of crypto and the speculative money that's poured into digital assets. Criminals stole a record $14 billion worth of cryptocurrency last year, according to a report by data firm Chainalysis, and the SEC announced Tuesday that it will almost double its staff responsible for protecting investors in crypto markets.""Blockchain has been around for decades, it has never found a widespread adoption use case,"" said Stephen Diamond, a law professor at Santa Clara University. ""There's a mania underway and for the state of California to come in and essentially say this has huge potential, to me, they're feeding the mania.""Myers said it's critical to put in place ""guardrails"" to eliminate the ability for bad actors to maneuver and to ""make sure there are enforceable and clear guidelines to protect everybody.""Timothy Massad, former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said it's important to get states and government agencies on the same page.""What we would not want to see is a situation where states are competing with one another to attract businesses by either lowering standards or providing incentives,"" Massad said.WATCH: SEC boosts crypto unit"

It's since pared back its gains and was last trading at about $15.43.It's not clear whether Musk actually bought a Bored Ape NFT. The billionaire liked a tweet from Michael Bouhanna, an executive at auction house Sotheby's, who said the image was ""created for our Sotheby's sale.""""Happy to send you the original file minted with the buyer approval,"" Bouhanna wrote in the tweet.It suggests Musk may have merely right clicked and saved the picture to make it his profile image. Twitter has a dedicated feature that allows users to set their NFT as a hexagonal display picture, but Musk's avatar is just a standard profile image. NFTs are meant to authenticate ownership of everything from digital art to sports memorabilia on the blockchain. But they've attracted ridicule from skeptics, given it's easy to continue replicating and distributing the associated content online without buying a token.Musk — who recently agreed a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion — appeared to poke fun at NFTs in a follow-up tweet.""I dunno … seems kinda fungible,"" the Tesla and SpaceX boss posted.NFTs are designed to not be fungible — in other words, they can't be exchanged interchangeably.It's not the first time Musk's activity on Twitter has led to wild movements in asset prices. Numerous tweets by the Tesla and SpaceX boss have caused the price of bitcoin and dogecoin — a ""meme"" cryptocurrency favored by Musk — to rise or fall dramatically.The Bored Ape NFT collection has garnered a cult-like following since its inception a year ago, with everyone from diehard crypto investors to celebrities like Jimmy Fallon buying up the buzzy ape icons. This weekend, Yuga Labs minted a collection of deeds to virtual land in an upcoming ""metaverse"" game called Otherside. Demand for the NFTs, known as Otherdeeds, was so high that it clogged up the Ethereum blockchain, which underpins the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency.That caused Ethereum's ""gas fees"" — costs required to approve transactions — to skyrocket. Some users reported having to pay fees in excess of $4,000. Yuga Labs subsequently apologized over the debacle, and said it would refund users gas fees for any failed transactions.""We're sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while,"" the company tweeted Saturday. ""It seems abundantly clear that ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale.""In a further tweet Sunday, Yuga Labs said it was ""still working on refunding all Otherdeed minters with failed transactions their gas.""Despite the brief boost Wednesday, the ApeCoin token has fallen roughly 17% in the past week. With a market value of $4.4 billion, it ranks among the top 40 digital currencies on CoinGecko."
2022-05-05,"The state of New York wants to ban new bitcoin mining operations, a move that some industry insiders fear could have a domino effect across the U.S.The bill, which is making its way through Albany, calls for a two-year moratorium on certain cryptocurrency mining operations that use proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions.Proof-of-work mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity, has virtually become synonymous with bitcoin, though ethereum — at least for another few months — still uses this method to secure its network. The state of New York wants to ban new bitcoin mining operations, a move that some industry insiders fear could have a domino effect across the U.S.The bill, which is swiftly making its way through the state capitol in Albany, calls for a two-year moratorium on certain cryptocurrency mining operations that use proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions. Proof-of-work mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity, is used to create bitcoin, though ethereum — at least for another few months — still uses this method to secure its network.Lawmakers sponsoring the legislation say they are looking to curb the state's carbon footprint by cracking down on mines that use electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels. For two years, unless a proof-of-work mining company uses 100% renewable energy, it would not be allowed to expand or renew permits, and new entrants would not be allowed to come online.The net effect of this, according to Galaxy Digital's Head of Mining Amanda Fabiano, would be to weaken New York's economy by forcing businesses to take jobs elsewhere.""New York will be left behind, losing to other states at best, and at worst, other more progressive nations. New York is setting a bad precedent that other states could follow,"" said Fabiano, echoing a concern held by many in the crypto industry.At this point, the State Assembly has passed the bill, and it is now under consideration by the Democratic-controlled State Senate, which will soon vote on the measure. If it passes, it will land on the desk of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it.""If it passes, it would make New York the first state in the country to ban blockchain technology infrastructure,"" explained Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Digital Chamber of Commerce. In some ways, New York offers dream conditions to bitcoin miners.Miners compete in a low-margin industry where the only variable cost is typically energy, so they have a strong economic incentive to migrate to the world's cheapest sources of power – which also tend to be renewable. A third of New York's in-state generation comes from renewables, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. New York counts its nuclear power plants toward its 100% carbon free electricity goal, and the state produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains.The state also has a chilly climate, which means less energy is needed to cool down the banks of computers used in crypto mining, as well as a lot of abandoned industrial infrastructure that's ripe for repurposing. Crypto mining company Coinmint, for example, operates a facility in a former Alcoa aluminum smelter in Massena, which taps into the area's abundant wind power, plus the cheap electricity produced from the dams that line the St. Lawrence River. The Massena site, at 435 megawatts of transformer capacity, is billed as one of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in the U.S.But not all operations run on renewables. Companies like Greenidge Generation, which operates its bitcoin mining facility in a former coal plant retrofitted for natural gas, have drawn the ire of some lawmakers who now want to stamp out the state's crypto mining industry.The northern border town of Plattsburgh temporarily enacted its own local ban on cryptocurrency mining operations in 2018, and just last year, politicians tried to shut down parts of the mining industry statewide. That move failed after a union representing electrical workers came out in defense of the mining industry.This latest effort, however, appears to have real teeth.One section of the bill currently under consideration in Albany involves conducting a statewide study of the environmental impact of proof-of-work mining operations on New York's ability to reach aggressive climate goals set under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which requires New York's greenhouse gas emissions be cut by 85% by 2050. Boring tells CNBC the recent swell of support in favor of this year's proposed ban has a whole lot to do with this mandate to transition to sustainable energy. ""Proof-of-work mining has the potential to lead the global transition to more sustainable energy,"" Boring told CNBC's Crypto World, pointing to the irony of the moratorium. ""The bitcoin mining industry is actually leading in terms of compliance with that Act.""The sustainable energy mix of the global bitcoin mining industry today is estimated to be just under 60%, and the Digital Chamber of Commerce has found that the sustainable electricity mix is closer to 80% for its members mining in the state of New York.""The regulatory environment in New York will not only halt their target – carbon-based fuel proof of work mining – but will also likely discourage new, renewable-based miners from doing business with the state due to the possibility of more regulatory creep,"" said John Warren, CEO of institutional-grade bitcoin mining company GEM Mining.In a conversation at the Bitcoin 2022 conference last month in Miami, former presidential candidate and New Yorker Andrew Yang told CNBC that when he speaks to folks in the industry, he has found mining operations can help develop demand for a renewable source of energy.""In my mind, a lot of this stuff is going to end up pushing activity to other places that might not achieve the goal of the policymakers,"" said Yang.Some in the industry aren't waiting for lawmakers to make a ban official before taking action.Data from digital currency company Foundry shows that New York's share of the bitcoin mining network dropped from 20% to 10% in a matter of months, as miners begin migrating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions in other parts of the country.""Our customers are being scared off from investing in New York state,"" said Kevin Zhang of Foundry.""Even from Foundry's deployments of $500 million in capital towards mining equipment, less than 5% has gone to New York because of the unfriendly political landscape,"" continued Zhang. If New York passes a crypto mining moratorium, it could have a number of follow-on effects.Beyond potentially stifling investment in more sustainable energy sources, industry advocates tell CNBC that each of these facilities drives significant economic impact with many local vendors consisting of electricians, engineers, and construction workers. An exodus of crypto miners, according to experts, could translate to jobs and tax dollars moving out of state. ""There are many unions labor unions who are against this bill because it could have dire economic consequences,"" said Boring. ""Bitcoin mining operations are providing high-paying and high-grade, great jobs for local communities. One of our members, their average pay is $80,000 a year.""As Boring points out, New York is a leader when it comes to state legislation, so there is also the potential for a copycat phenomenon rippling across the country.""Other blue states often follow the lead of New York state and this would be giving them an easy template to replicate,"" said Zhang, Foundry's SVP of Mining Strategy.""Sure, the network will be fine — it survived a nation-state attack from China last summer — but the implications for where the technology will scale and develop in the future are massive,"" continued Zhang.However, many others in the industry think concerns over the fallout of a mining moratorium in New York are overblown.Veteran bitcoin miners like Core Scientific co-founder Darin Feinstein say the industry already knows New York is generally hostile to the crypto mining business.""There's no reason to go into a region that doesn't want you,"" said Feinstein. ""Bitcoin miners are really a data center business, and the data center needs to locate in jurisdictions that want to have data centers within their borders...If you're going to ignore that, then you have to deal with the consequences of conducting business in a region that doesn't want your business.""Feinstein and other miners point out that there are plenty of friendlier jurisdictions: Georgia, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming have all become major mining destinations.Texas has crypto-friendly lawmakers, a deregulated power grid with real-time spot pricing, and access to significant excess renewable energy, as well as stranded or flared natural gas. The state's regulatory friendliness toward miners also makes the industry very predictable, according to Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners.""It is a very attractive environment for miners to deploy large amounts of capital in,"" he said. ""The sheer number of land deals and power purchase agreements that are in various stages of negotiation is enormous.""Texas Blockchain Council President Lee Bratcher tells CNBC that if New York does send the bill to the Governor's desk, New York's hashrate (an industry term used to describe the collective computing power of the bitcoin network) will just flow to other jurisdictions within the United States that understand the benefit to their constituents of the job creation, tax revenue, and renewable energy generation incentives that bitcoin miners bring.Senator Cynthia Lummis, R-Wy., explains the appeal of mining to her state.""In my state, we export a great deal of energy, both hydrocarbon energy and green energy. We should be using more of that energy in state to produce bitcoin,"" said Lummis, who went on to describe the process of using other wasted natural gas to power bitcoin mining operations.""When China banned bitcoin mining, it actually proved a benefit here in the United States in that miners just moved,"" continued Lummis, referring to China's countrywide ban on the entire industry in May 2021.Feinstein tells CNBC that if New York wants to take a similar approach by banning the industry, ""it's a gift to every other state in America that wants to embrace the most important economic financial accounting technology that's been invented by humans ever."""

The federal government has no business interfering with the ability of American workers to invest their 401(k) plan savings as they see fit.Sadly, that's not the Biden administration's view.The U.S. Department of Labor on March 10 released regulatory guidance in an attempt to bar 401(k) accounts from investing in cryptocurrency, singling out this specific investment type. The guidance came from the Employee Benefits Security Administration – a small but powerful agency inside the Labor Department charged by Congress with regulating the $6.2 trillion 401(k) investment industry covering about 91 million American workers.The Labor Department's guidance threatens to investigate plans that allow participants to select investments in cryptocurrency, including plans with brokerage windows, a tool used by retirement savers to self-select their 401(k) plan investments.More from Personal Finance:Bipartisan Senate bill would update SSI program benefit rulesMost Americans still optimistic about retirement: surveyIRS boosts 2023 HSA limits for individuals, familiesThis policy change is inconsistent with longstanding practice. The Labor Department has long permitted employers to offer brokerage windows as an option to employees who prefer to personally manage the money they worked hard to earn. The agency's new guidance ends this tradition of economic empowerment in favor of big-brother government control.Additionally, the Labor Department's overreaching guidance seeks to place a massive new regulatory burden on 401(k) plan fiduciaries by requiring them to assess the suitability of investments offered through a brokerage window and to restrict investment options. If a company or financial firm allows their 401(k) investors to choose to invest in cryptocurrency, they will now be at risk for heavy-handed enforcement actions.Additionally, the guidance was published without announcement, and the agency skirted the notice and public comment process put in place by Congress that agencies are required to follow.Americans should be able to invest their retirement savings as they choose. That's why today I am introducing the Financial Freedom Act.My bill would prohibit the Labor Department from issuing a regulation or guidance that limits the type of investments that self-directed 401(k) account investors can choose through a brokerage window. Additionally, the act would hold harmless a 401(k) plan's decision-makers who authorize individual retirement savers to self-direct their investment choices using a brokerage window.The Financial Freedom Act empowers the American retirement saver and preserves the precedent of investment freedom. For decades, 401(k) participants in plans with brokerage windows have been able to buy and sell investments of their choice – that freedom to choose is the entire purpose of the brokerage window. The Labor Department should not be able to limit the range or type of investments retirement savers can select.Today, the Biden administration is targeting cryptocurrency. Which investment class is next?Whether or not you believe in the long-term economic prospects of cryptocurrency, the choice of what you invest your retirement savings in should be yours — not that of the government. It's clear there is interest in giving retirement savers the option to invest in cryptocurrency. Fidelity, the nation's largest 401(k) provider, recently announced that it will make bitcoin available on its platform. They aren't the first provider to make this move, and likely won't be the last. Sadly, the Labor Department has already criticized these plans to empower investors.America was built on the idea that we each chart our own destiny. The government-knows-best approach being pushed by the current administration runs counter to the values that made our country the most prosperous nation in history.— By Sen.

It's an ill-defined term, but Web3 as a concept loosely refers to new web experiences built around blockchain, the technology that underpins many cryptocurrencies.Such services could incorporate digital tokens like non-fungible tokens, or NFTs — the crypto equivalent of collectible items like rare art or trading cards — into areas like social media, web browsers or video games.A Binance-owned stake in Twitter could be Zhao's chance to realize Web3's decentralized ideals.""We're excited to be able to help Elon realize a new vision for Twitter,"" Zhao told CNBC Thursday. ""We hope to be able to play a role in bringing social media and Web3 together and broadening the use and adoption of crypto and blockchain technology.""Musk, a self-proclaimed ""free speech absolutist,"" has frequently bemoaned what he views as censorship by Twitter of conservative-leaning voices on the platform. Bitcoin and other digital currencies aren't controlled by any single entity, a setup that proponents say makes them ""censorship-resistant.""Before he stepped down as CEO, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey helped establish an initiative aimed at creating decentralized social media protocols. Called Bluesky, the project was formed in part to address the issue of a handful of powerful tech companies controlling the most popular online services.Though backed by Twitter, Bluesky says it is an ""independent company."" Dorsey, who has publicly backed Musk's bid and is a vocal supporter of bitcoin, remains on Bluesky's board.""In principle, I don't believe anyone should own or run Twitter,"" Dorsey said in a recent tweet. ""It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company."" While it's still unclear what exactly Musk has planned for Twitter, he has already hinted at plans to make the site more crypto-friendly, including accepting meme-inspired token dogecoin as a method of payment.""I think that bodes really well for how Twitter as a private organization may be able to be even more nimble and more agile in terms of servicing these growing ecosystems, be it crypto or other new technologies,"" Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of crypto asset manager Grayscale, told CNBC in a recent interview. Musk may need some convincing, however.

""But if I asked 100 different people, you'd get 100 different responses.""""How you make those decisions in a way that might go against your personal values but also upholds free speech — these are very difficult, complicated conversations to have and I don't envy the wealthiest man in the world trying to take that off."""
2022-05-06,"Nvidia will pay $5.5 million as part of a settlement with the SEC that it did not properly inform investors about how cryptocurrency miners were stoking demand for its graphics cards.Graphics cards, like those Nvidia makes, are well-suited to mine ethereum. Nvidia will pay $5.5 million as part of a settlement with the SEC that it did not properly inform investors about how cryptocurrency miners were stoking demand for its graphics cards.Nvidia failed to disclose how cryptocurrency mining drove growth in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2018, which took place in 2017, the SEC said in a filing.The settlement represents the end to a saga in which Nvidia, best known for making graphics cards for gaming, found itself with a surprise revenue boost from cryptocurrency miners which later declined to become immaterial. Nvidia declined to comment.Graphics cards, like those Nvidia makes, are well-suited to mine ethereum. In 2017, ether prices rose from under $10 to over $800, prompting miners to buy new hardware to cash in.Nvidia's gaming category, which is how the company reports those sales, rose 52% on an annual basis in the second quarter of its 2018 fiscal year (which ended June 30, 2017), and by 25% in the following quarter — but Nvidia failed to disclose cryptocurrency's effect on that growth, the SEC says. Nvidia was aware that cryptocurrency mining was driving part of its business, according to the SEC filing.The company's sales staff in China at the time believed the increase in demand for gaming GPUs was because of miners, and Nvidia's senior management wanted to go after the crypto mining market, according to the SEC filing.But cryptocurrency may have ended up being a distraction for Nvidia as demand grew for its graphics cards for their intended uses, gaming and artificial intelligence.In 2021, Nvidia released new cards intended for mining called Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, and added software to its graphics cards to prevent them from being used for mining. Nvidia's graphics cards were in extremely short supply in 2020 and 2021 as gaming demand driven by the pandemic prompted users to upgrade their home gaming PCs.However, CMP sales have declined sharply since their introduction. In the most recent quarter, CMP revenue was only $24 million, down from $266 million in the August 2021 quarter.""Our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining, though we have limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand,"" Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said in earnings commentary in February."

In January, Google's cloud unit revealed plans for a Digital Assets Team to work with customers, following the emerging growth of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. The company said it was looking at how customers could make payments with cryptocurrencies.Going forward, Google could devise a system other companies could employ to make blockchain data easy for people to explore, while simplifying the process of building and running blockchain nodes for validating and recording transactions, Zavery said. He added that Google's tools can work in other computing environments, such as Amazon Web Services.Enthusiasm around bitcoin, the most established cryptocurrency, has tapered off this year as investors have turned away from risky assets. As of late Thursday, bitcoin was down 21% so far in 2022, underperforming the S&P 500, which has dropped about 13%.But blockchain applications continue to find their way into the mainstream and have increasing relevance in industries such as financial services and retail, said Zavery.Nike CEO John Donahoe told analysts on a conference call in March that the shoe company plans to build Web3 products and experiences.

El Salvador just added another $15.5 million worth of bitcoin to its balance sheet, as the world's most popular cryptocurrency continues its sell-off.In a tweet on Monday, President Nayib Bukele revealed that the country bought the dip, adding another 500 bitcoin to government coffers.It is El Salvador's largest coin purchase since it first began adding the digital currency to its balance sheet in Sept. 2021 — the same month it became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar.Bitcoin is down more than 8% in the last 24 hours, and it's nearly 55% off its November all-time high.El Salvador purchased bitcoin at an average price of $30,744, according to the president's tweet.The country's total reserve is up to 2,301 bitcoin, or about $71.7 million at current prices, based on data tracked by Bloomberg.This is the latest in a string of dip buys over the last nine months, in which President Bukele — who has tethered his political fate to the success of the country's bitcoin experiment — has doubled down on his bitcoin bet, as the crypto market plummets.The country's decision to lean into bitcoin is not without its skeptics — a contingent that has been gaining momentum in recent months. For months, the International Monetary Fund has bemoaned Bukele's bitcoin experiment.In January, the IMF pushed El Salvador to ditch bitcoin as legal tender.IMF directors ""stressed that there are large risks associated with the use of bitcoin on financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection, as well as the associated fiscal contingent liabilities.""The report, which was published after bilateral talks with El Salvador, went on to ""urge"" authorities to narrow the scope of its bitcoin law by removing bitcoin's status as legal money.The IMF report went on to say that some directors had expressed concern over the risks associated with issuing bitcoin-backed bonds, referring to the president's plan to raise $1 billion via a ""Bitcoin Bond"" in partnership with Blockstream, a digital assets infrastructure company. However, that bond offering was put on ice in March, due to ""unfavorable market conditions,"" according to Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya.

For a country where 70% of citizens do not have access to traditional financial services, Chivo is meant to offer a convenient on-ramp for those who have never been a part of the banking system.IMF directors agreed that the Chivo e-wallet could facilitate digital means of payment, thereby helping to ""boost financial inclusion,"" though they emphasized the need for ""strict regulation and oversight."" Many Salvadorans have reported cases of identity theft, in which hackers use their national ID number to open a Chivo e-wallet, in order to claim the free $30 worth of bitcoin offered by the government as an incentive.A report published in April by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research also showed that only 20% of those who downloaded the wallet continued to use it after spending the $30 bonus.

2022-05-09,"Top cryptocurrencies are continuing their rough start to the year, falling alongside stocks.Bitcoin slumped more than 6% Monday, falling below $33,000, according to Coin Metrics. The digital coin is now more than 50% from its all-time high near $69,000 in November and has shed more than 30% year to date.At the same time, ether fell more than 7% to about $2,300. It's now down more than 35% from the start of the year. While the losses can be distressing to investors, they also offer a chance for people interested in buying cryptocurrencies to review their financial plan and get into the volatile asset class if it makes sense for them, said Tyrone Ross, CEO of Onramp Invest, a crypto-asset platform for financial advisors and firms.""When something goes on sale and you like it, you should buy it,"" he said. In addition, cryptocurrencies have become an increasingly accepted form of payment.""I think we're not at mass adoption yet, but we are at mass acceptance,"" said Ross, adding that for those who've done their research and decided that crypto is right for them, it's a good time to jump into the investment.How to determine if crypto is right for you To be sure, you shouldn't rush into any investment just because it is relatively cheap, experts say.If buying crypto doesn't fit your long-term financial goals, you shouldn't purchase it just because it's trading at a relative discount, according to Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington, D.C.""If your time horizon is 10 years, I think now is a fine time to buy it,"" he said. Otherwise, he recommends that investors take a more holistic approach to the asset instead of trying to time a volatile market.More from Invest in You:5 ways to improve your credit score if applying for a mortgageMore Americans cash-strapped as cost of living rises across boardDeepak Chopra: Here's how to be mindful with your moneyInvestors should have a clear goal for buying crypto instead of being pulled in only because the price dropped, he said. Reasons include seeing the asset as a store of value, viewing it as uncorrelated to stocks or wanting to own it because of the increasing rate of adoption. Before buying, people should be conscious of how much of their total portfolio is invested in cryptocurrencies and make sure the allocation matches their risk profile, Johnson said. New investors should have a firm grasp on how much they're willing to risk before they buy.""If you put 20% in crypto and you can't stomach volatility, you've got what's known as a problem,"" he said. ""But if you've got 1% or 2% or 3%, it's not as big of a hit to your portfolio."" What to expect when investingInvestors should expect that cryptocurrencies will continue to be volatile. What's more, the historically risky asset hasn't been tested in an environment like the one we're seeing today, where interest rates are set to rise, according to both Ross and Johnson.""You should fully expect that [crypto] will go down further, so only put in what you can afford to lose,"" said Ross. ""If we wake up tomorrow and it goes to zero, you should be able to still pay your rent.""Before putting money into crypto, both experts stressed the importance of having a secure personal financial situation and clear investment plan.  ""If you dollar-cost average on the way down and also on the way up, it will smooth out that volatility and also enhance returns,"" said Ross.SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.CHECK OUT: How to make money with creative side hustles, from people who earn thousands on sites like Etsy and Twitch via Grow with Acorns+CNBC.Disclosure: NBCUniversal and Comcast Ventures are investors in Acorns."
2022-05-10,"Crypto investors are keeping a close eye on UST, a controversial stablecoin, as the organization that supports it is sitting on billions of dollars in bitcoin.Terra's UST token sank below 40 cents Wednesday, as holders continued to flee the controversial stablecoin.Traders worry the project might have sold, or will sell, a large portion of its bitcoin to prop up UST. Investors in bitcoin are in panic mode as the controversial terraUSD stablecoin slips further from its intended $1 peg.TerraUSD, otherwise known as UST, sank below 40 cents for the first time Wednesday, as holders continued to flee the token in what some have described as a ""bank run."" The token at one point fell as low as 31 cents, according to CoinGecko data.Created by Singapore-based Terraform Labs in 2018, UST is what's known as an ""algorithmic"" stablecoin. Part of the Terra blockchain project, it's meant to track the value of the dollar, like fellow stablecoins tether and USDC.However, unlike with those cryptocurrencies, Terra doesn't have cash and other assets held in a reserve to back its token. Instead, it uses a complex mix of code — alongside a sister token called luna — to stabilize prices.UST is important for bitcoin investors as Luna Foundation Guard, an organization supporting the Terra project, is sitting on billions of dollars in bitcoin that could potentially be dumped onto the market at any point.""Every professional investor in crypto has one eye on UST today, watching to see if it can maintain its peg to the dollar,"" said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management. ""There's clearly significant risk in the market."" In simple terms, the Terra protocol destroys and creates new units of UST and luna to adjust supply. When the price of UST falls below the dollar, it can be taken out of circulation and exchanged for luna, making UST's supply more scarce and boosting its price — at least, that's how it should work in theory.To further complicate things, Terra's creator, Do Kwon, bought $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin to provide a backstop for UST in times of crisis. The theory was that UST could eventually be redeemed for bitcoin instead of luna, but this is untested and hasn't yet been put into practice.Deposits into Anchor, Terra's flagship lending protocol, have declined from 10.3 billion tokens on May 6 to just 6.4 billion Tuesday, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Nansen. Anchor offered users an almost 20% annual percentage yield on their UST holdings, a rate many analysts believe was unsustainable.

""Very little"" of the borrowed bitcoins have been spent, Luna Foundation Guard said, but it is ""currently being used to buy"" UST.Several crypto investors are worried that Luna Foundation Guard might have sold, or will sell, a large portion of its bitcoin to prop up UST — analysts pointed out that the group's bitcoin wallet is now completely empty.Amid all of this uncertainty, UST's decline has sent shock waves throughout the crypto market.Bitcoin, the world's largest digital currency, briefly fell below $30,000 late Monday, hitting its lowest price since July 2021. As of Wednesday, bitcoin was stable at $31,927 a coin — but still down more than 50% from its November all-time high.Luna, UST's counterpart, has lost more than three quarters of its value in the past 24 hours. It was last trading at a price of $3.78.Adding to UST holders' woes, Binance, the largest crypto exchange by market volume, temporarily suspended withdrawals of both UST and luna ""due to a high volume of pending withdrawal transactions,"" citing network congestion.Binance has since resumed withdrawals, and says it will ""continue to monitor"" network conditions.""I think the market is expecting some forced selling here on the part of Terra and the reserve,"" Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics, told CNBC. ""It is a calamity but very expected. No algorithmic stablecoin has ever succeeded and this is no exception.""He added that the problem with UST is that it's largely ""backed by faith.""""It's not fully guaranteed, it's certainly not fully backed by reserves,"" he told CNBC. ""It was really just backed by faith in the issuer effectively.""Terraform Labs did not respond to multiple requests for comment."

Billionaire Mark Cuban sees the slide, which is happening at the same time as stock markets are being pummeled by inflation fears, as echoing the early 2000s dotcom bubble.In the late 1990s, speculative investing led internet-based companies' valuations to soar wildly, which sent the Nasdaq Composite stock market index up 400% in a five-year span before a steep crash in 2001 and 2002.Now, ""crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,"" Cuban tweeted on Monday.The Dallas Mavericks owner and investor on ABC's ""Shark Tank"" said that ""after the initial surge of exciting apps"" and NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, crypto is entering an ""imitation phase"" where too many companies are failing to bring new utility to the market.But the blockchains that do emerge from the lull will be the ones that use ""smart contracts to improve business productivity and profitability,"" Cuban predicts, rather than the ones that aren't doing anything original. Smart contracts are digital agreements that are coded and stored on the blockchain which power decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications and NFTs and are necessary in forming decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs.""The chains that copy what everyone else has, will fail,"" Cuban tweeted. ""We don't need NFTs or DeFi on every chain.""As for if more lulls are down the road for crypto, Cuban isn't sure. ""I have no idea,"" he told CNBC Make It.It's not the first time Cuban has compared crypto to the development of the web. Early last year, he said the development of blockchain technology reminded him of ""the early days of the internet"" and that current blockchain companies are similar to internet pioneers like Broadcast.com — the company whose sale to Yahoo in 1999 made him a billionaire.""[It took time] before bandwidth became available and cheap enough so that streaming and cord-cutting could really happen,"" he said in 2021. ""That was 20 years into the internet, give or take, and we're only 10, 12 years into crypto.""Cuban is a prolific crypto investor with a portfolio of various digital coins, NFTs and investments in a number of blockchain companies.Disclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to ""Shark Tank.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Do these 3 things as soon as you get your paycheck to keep your finances in good shape"
2022-05-13,"Robinhood shares jumped 24.9% on Friday, a day after the CEO of a major crypto exchange took a stake in the retail investing app.An entity called Emergent Fidelity Technologies took a 7.6% stake in Robinhood worth $648 million earlier this month, according to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The document also showed Sam Bankman-Fried, who leads the Bahamas-based crypto company FTX, is the sole director and majority owner of Emergent. The stake makes Emergent the third-largest Robinhood shareholder, FactSet data shows.Shares of Robinhood closed at $8.56 on Thursday, the day the document was filed. That was about 77% below the company's July IPO price.Bankman-Fried acquired the shares because they ""represent an attractive investment,"" according to the filing, which also says he ""intends to hold the Shares as an investment"" and doesn't have ""any intention of taking any action toward changing or influencing the control of the Issuer.""He may ""from time to time engage in discussions"" with management, however.""Of course we think it is an attractive investment too,"" Robinhood's communications team said in a tweet Thursday evening in response to the news of the investment.Bankman-Fried can also review ""options for enhancing stockholder value through, among other things, various strategic alternatives or operational or management initiatives,"" according to the document. It also said he could acquire additional shares.FTX is one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world. It offers derivatives products for more sophisticated traders, as well as spot trading, and has become a rival to big names such as Coinbase and Binance. It offers services in the U.S. through a separate entity, FTX U.S.Though Robinhood got its start in stock trading, it saw huge success when it rolled out its crypto trading platform in 2018. Crypto trading has since become important for the company's bottom line. In the fall, Robinhood revealed its testing a crypto wallet and said the waitlist for it had topped 1 million customers."
2022-05-13,"TerraUSD, an ""algorithmic"" stablecoin that's meant to be pegged one-to-one with the dollar, plunged below $1 this week.Tether, the world's biggest stablecoin, also temporarily ""broke the buck"" on Thursday.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has urged Congress to approve federal regulation of stablecoins. Regulators are getting increasingly worried about stablecoins after the collapse of controversial cryptocurrency venture Terra.TerraUSD, an ""algorithmic"" stablecoin that's meant to be pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar, has erased much of its value this week after a stunning run on the bank that saw billions of dollars suddenly evaporate from its market value.Also known as UST, the cryptocurrency operated using a complex mechanism of code combined with a floating token called luna to balance supply and demand and stabilize prices, as well as a multibillion-dollar pile of bitcoin.Tether, the world's biggest stablecoin, also slipped below its intended $1 for several hours on Thursday, fueling fears of a possible contagion from the fallout of UST de-pegging. Unlike UST, tether is supposed to be backed by sufficient assets held in a reserve.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen directly addressed the issue of both UST and tether ""breaking the buck"" this week. In a congressional hearing, Yellen said such assets don't currently pose a systemic risk to financial stability — but suggested they eventually could.""I wouldn't characterize it at this scale as a real threat to financial stability but they're growing very rapidly,"" she told lawmakers Thursday. ""They present the same kind of risks that we have known for centuries in connection with bank runs.""Yellen urged Congress to approve federal regulation of stablecoins by the end of this year.The U.K. government is also taking notice. A spokesperson for the government told CNBC Friday that it stands ready to take further action on stablecoins after Terra's collapse.""The government has been clear that certain stablecoins are not suitable for payment purposes as they share characteristics with unbacked cryptoassets,"" the spokesperson said.Britain is planning to bring stablecoins within the scope of electronic payments regulation, which could see issuers such as Tether and Circle become subject to supervision by the country's markets watchdog.Separate proposals in the European Union would also bring stablecoins under strict regulatory oversight. They're sort of like casino chips for the crypto world. Traders buy tokens like tether or USDC with real dollars. The tokens can then by used to trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The idea is that, whenever someone wants to cash in, they can get the equivalent amount of dollars for however many stablecoins they want to sell. Stablecoin issuers are meant to hold a sufficient level of money corresponding to the number of tokens in circulation.Today, the entire market for stablecoins is worth more than $160 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. Tether is the world's biggest, with a market value of about $80 billion. UST is a bit of a unique case in the stablecoin world. Unlike tether, it didn't have any actual cash to back its purported peg to the dollar — though it was at one point partially backed by bitcoin. Instead, UST relied on a system of algorithms. It went something like this:The price of UST can fall below a dollar when there's too many tokens in circulation but not enough demandsmart contracts — lines of code written into the blockchain — would kick in to take the excess UST out of supply and create new units of a token called luna, which has a floating priceThere was also an arbitrage system at play, where traders were encouraged to profit from deviations in the price of the two tokensThe idea was that you could always buy $1 worth of luna for one UST. So if UST was worth 98 cents, you could essentially buy one, swap it with luna and pocket 2 cents in profit.Luna, UST's sister token, is now basically worthless after having previously topped $100 a coin earlier this year.The whole system was designed to stabilize UST at $1. But it crumbled under the pressure of billions of dollars in liquidations — particularly on Anchor, a lending platform that promised users interest rates as high as 20% on their savings. Many experts say this was unsustainable. The main fear is that a major stablecoin issuer like Tether could be next to experience a ""run on the bank.""Yellen and other U.S. officials have often compared them to money market funds. In 2008, the Reserve Primary Fund — the original money market fund — lost its net asset value of $1 a share. The fund held some of its assets in commercial paper (short-term corporate debt) from Lehman Brothers. When Lehman went bust, investors fled.Previously, Tether said its reserves consisted entirely of dollars. But it reversed this position after a 2019 settlement with the New York attorney general. Disclosures from the firm revealed it had very little cash but lots of unidentified commercial paper.Tether now says it is reducing the level of commercial paper it owns and increasing its holdings of U.S. Treasury bills.""We expect recent developments to lead to increased calls for regulation of stablecoins,"" ratings agency Fitch said in a note Thursday. While the risks of stablecoins like tether ""can be more manageable"" than algorithmic ones like UST, it ultimately falls down to the creditworthiness of the firms that issue them, according to Fitch.""Many regulated financial entities have have increased their exposure to cryptocurrencies, defi and other forms of digital finance in recent months, and some Fitch-rated issuers could be affected if crypto market volatility becomes severe,"" the company said.""There is also a risk of an impact on the real economy, for example through negative wealth effects if crypto asset values fall steeply. Nonetheless, we view the risks to Fitch-rated issuers and real economic activity as being generally very low."""
2022-05-13,"The price of bitcoin bounced on Friday and wavered over the $30,000 mark, after dropping to 2022 lows earlier in the week, as stocks climbed higher and investors digested the fallout of Terra's UST stablecoin.Bitcoin last traded 5.3% higher at $30,046.85, according to Coin Metrics. On Thursday it fell as low as $25,401.29, its weakest point since December 2020. Meanwhile, ether gained 6.6% and was trading at $2,063.67.Bitcoin and ether finished their worst weeks since May 2021, down more than 15% and 22%, respectively. This is bitcoin's seventh down week in a row.Crypto markets have struggled all year amid the broader market turmoil. Bitcoin, which continues to lead cryptocurrency prices, remains highly correlated with tech stocks, and all three of the major stock averages were higher Friday.This week has been especially dire for cryptocurrency investors as they watched Terra's UST stablecoin and luna token fall apart, which at least temporarily scared investors and hit bitcoin prices. ""We have a lot of near term chaos, this has been just the year of fear, panic and a lot of investors sitting on their hands,""  Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and CIO of Defiance ETFs told CNBC. ""When you get this news now about Terra and the sister coin, luna, crashing, that just creates this absolute wall of worry,"" she added, ""and you have the combination of the Fed and relentless market volatility coupled with a loss of confidence in crypto – a lot of investors start to run for the hills.""By Friday, however, bitcoin was back to behaving like an equity, she added.Yuya Hasegawa, a crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank, said bitcoin bounced because it passed ""the worst part of the week"" – inflation data.Cryptocurrencies fell with stocks this week after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported consumer prices for the month of April jumped 8.3%, which was slightly higher than expected by economists polled by Dow Jones.""The market glimpsed a little bit of hope this week that inflation may have hit the ceiling, and it did it without the effect of the monetary tightening that the Fed decided earlier this month,"" Hasegawa said.$30,000 is a key psychological level for investors, as many are experiencing their first big crypto crash. Until it began to tumble this month, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap had been drifting between about $38,000 and $45,000 this year, well off its November all-time high of $68,982.20.Technical analysts have said if bitcoin can't hold $30,000 it could fall further still. Hasegawa said bitcoin could soon reverse higher.""Although the market still needs to fully digest the whole TerraUSD panic, which could be accompanied by capitulation, bitcoin is nearing its bottom in terms of the timing,"" he said."
2022-05-16,"Luna Foundation Guard said it spent almost all of the bitcoin in its reserve last week in a futile attempt to save terraUSD.TerraUSD — or UST, for short — has fallen well below its intended $1 peg. By Monday, it was trading at just 9 cents.Terra creator Do Kwon had promised to use the bitcoin in the event of a dramatic fall in the value of UST. Investors have been eager to find out what happened to the $3 billion in bitcoin bought up by crypto firm Terra to back its failed stablecoin. Now, they've got their answer.Luna Foundation Guard, a fund set up by Terra creator Do Kwon, said Monday it spent almost all of the bitcoin in its reserve last week in a futile attempt to save terraUSD — or UST, for short.The foundation had accumulated a total of more than 80,000 bitcoins, which was worth nearly $3 billion last week, as well as other tokens including BNB, tether, USDC and avalanche. Kwon had promised to use the bitcoin in the event of a dramatic fall in the value of UST.In a series of tweets, Luna Foundation Guard said it transferred 52,189 bitcoins to ""trade with a counterparty"" as UST fell below its intended $1 peg. A further 33,206 bitcoins were sold by Terra directly in a last-ditch effort to defend the peg, the foundation said.As of Monday, Luna Foundation Guard had just 313 bitcoins left in its reserve, worth approximately $9.3 million. The firm said it would use the remainder of its $85 million in crypto assets — including some BNB and avalanche — to ""compensate remaining users"" of UST.""We are still debating through various distribution methods, updates to follow soon,"" Luna Foundation Guard said.UST is what's known as an ""algorithmic"" stablecoin. Unlike tether and USDC, which hold fiat assets in a reserve to back their tokens, UST relied on a complex set of code, coupled with a floating token called luna, to balance supply and demand and stabilize the price.When UST began to drop below $1 last week, luna also started to sell off, resulting in a vicious cycle that caused UST to plunge to less than 30 cents while luna became worthless. UST is now worth just 9 cents, according to CoinGecko data.""The big problem when you're dealing with a partially collateralized stablecoin like UST is that your hard collateral — bitcoin, in this case — is going to be considerably more valuable to [investors] than your governance token,"" or luna, said Frances Coppola, an independent economist. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic estimates holders of UST and luna have lost a total of $42 billion over the past week. Analysis from the company shows that 52,189 bitcoins were moved to a single account at crypto exchange Gemini, while a further 28,205 bitcoins were transferred to Binance. Tom Robinson, chief scientist at Elliptic, said it was ""not possible"" to trace the movement of funds beyond these wallets.The debacle rippled through crypto markets, wiping out more than $200 billion of wealth in a single day. Bitcoin on Thursday briefly fell below $26,000, its lowest level since December 2020. The world's biggest cryptocurrency was last trading at $29,526.75, down 1.4% in the last 24 hours.""There's not a whole lot of outstanding sell pressure,"" said Dustin Teander, analyst at crypto research firm Messari.""In a sense, the market is going to take that as kind of bullish."""
2022-05-16,"In a speech in 2019, the Chinese leader said blockchain was an ""important breakthrough in independent innovation of core technologies."" Since then, China has quietly been building a platform that aims to facilitate the deployment of blockchain technology for enterprises. It is called Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN).BSN, which has links to the Chinese government, is aiming to go global but could face challenges. Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared that his country needs to ""seize the opportunities"" presented by blockchain technology.In a speech in 2019, the Chinese leader said blockchain was an ""important breakthrough in independent innovation of core technologies."" As a result of that speech, blockchain was elevated to a national priority for China, among other technologies — such as semiconductors — that the country is trying to boost its capabilities in.Since then, without much publicity and fanfare, China has been building a platform that aims to facilitate the deployment of blockchain technology for companies. It's called Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN).Here's what we know so far. Blockchain first came to prominence as the underlying technology of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. It is a distributed ledger of activity that records transactions on the bitcoin network.It is decentralized and no single entity owns or runs it. Instead, it's maintained by a network of participants running specialized computers.Since then, there have been many different definitions of what a blockchain could look like. Some companies or governments might refer to it as distributed ledger technology. Much of that derives from whether the blockchain is public or private. Permissionless blockchains — also known as trustless or public blockchains — allow anyone to join and potentially make changes to the blockchain, so long as they are running a particular software or a device.In contrast, permissioned blockchains are usually private and only allow certain participants to be involved in their use. Proponents of the technology say that blockchain can help bring transparency and speed to typically slow and expensive processes, such as cross-border money transfers.Another important aspect of blockchain technology is so-called smart contracts. These are contracts, written in code, that execute automatically if certain conditions are met. Proponents see these as being key in areas such as trade finance.""We think blockchain technology is so powerful it will change the entire internet and almost all the entire IT system architecture,"" Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Technology, told CNBC.Red Date Technology is one of the founding members of China's Blockchain-based Service Network. ""Blockchain technology in general is very important for China, as government officials see it as a low barrier to entry technology sector, and want Chinese companies to push the envelope on using blockchain applications to solve real world problems,"" Paul Triolo, the technology policy lead at consulting firm Albright Stonebridge, told CNBC. BSN's product is aimed at companies, in particular, those operating cloud computing infrastructure. That could be a large public cloud player like Amazon or Microsoft, or it could be a firm that runs its own private cloud or intranet.BSN bills itself as a ""one-stop shop"" to deploy these blockchain applications in the cloud, a process that could otherwise be costly and time consuming.The Chinese firm's other selling point is that it is trying to solve a difficult problem in the industry: interoperability — or making different blockchains work with each other. For example, if two banks both had applications that were built on different blockchain platforms, they may not be able to work with each other. But applications built via BSN infrastructure would be interoperable as the company bridges different blockchains.For companies that want to use several blockchain applications in their organization, BSN's product would allow them to do that via the cloud vendor they use rather than installing a bunch of new servers to build a blockchain product. The idea is that a business or government can use BSN's platform to easily deploy blockchain applications, without incurring a high cost.The demand now is low, according to Red Date's He, but he is bullish on the long-term future of the product.""I believe in 10 years all clouds will have a standard blockchain environment to handle all blockchain-related applications,"" the CEO said. One key point about BSN, however, is that it doesn't make its own blockchain.There is no cryptocurrency attached to BSN's platform. That's because China has effectively banned cryptocurrency-related activities and made them illegal.Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based Kenetic, a venture capital firm and investor in Red Date Technology, told CNBC that governments and large-scale companies don't want or need a cryptocurrency attached to their infrastructure.""This is where non-crypto use case comes in and BSN offers a compelling infrastructure,"" Chu said.Non-crypto blockchains could be appealing to large firms that don't want to be exposed to the risky and volatile nature of digital currencies. Start-up Red Date Technology, which is headquartered in Hong Kong, is one of the founding companies behind BSN.But the project is also backed by entities with links to the Chinese government. This includes the State Information Center (SIC) under China's powerful National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company, is also backing the project. BSN has ambitions to go global. However, its links to the Chinese government could make it difficult.""Part of the interest in BSN is that it is such an ambitious undertaking. This ambition also means that it has come under heavy scrutiny because of the Chinese government connection,"" said Triolo from Albright Stonebridge.He added that BSN ""is trying to separate the BSN International portion from the domestic efforts, and [trying] to distance from Chinese government backing.""The challenge is not lost on He, the CEO of Red Date Technology.""It's a huge, huge challenge,"" he acknowledged when asked about the plan to go global and the perception of being linked to the Chinese government.He said the international version of the platform will be open-source, allowing participants in the public domain to inspect the code for any potential backdoors.

He said ""a lot of people are not interested"" in the non-crypto blockchain offering. For the last few years, the U.S. have been engaged in an intense tech rivalry.China has focused on what it calls ""frontier"" technologies including quantum computing and semiconductors. Blockchain is another area of importance.Chinese tech companies have also placed a lot of emphasis on international expansion, a move supported by Beijing in the context of the global tech battle with the U.S.""The significance of the Blockchain Services Network is that it is an attempt by the Chinese government to support the development of blockchain ecosystems on its own terms, with allowances for regulatory approaches in different jurisdictions,"" Triolo said."

Robinhood is handing over the keys to some of its customers' crypto.The trading and investing company announced Tuesday it will let users hold and custody their own cryptocurrencies and NFTs in a separate, stand-alone app. It's the latest move in the digital asset space for Robinhood as it reaches for growth beyond stock trading. The company shares are off more than 70% since its IPO.The new app will put Robinhood squarely in competition with Coinbase and start-ups like MetaMask. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called his company's product the most downloaded, mobile self-custody wallet in the U.S. in a tweet Monday. The app will let users store non-fungible tokens, and connect to NFT marketplaces and ""decentralized"" stock exchanges. It will also let users earn yield through other platforms and access a ""variety"" of crypto assets on other exchanges, Robinhood said.Who holds, or ""custodies,"" someone's cryptocurrency has become a contentious question in the industry, fueling the viral phrase ""not your keys, not your coins."" Some fear storing assets on an exchange makes them more vulnerable to hacks, or censorship. Robinhood, which topped last year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list, made its name by offering commission-free stock trading.

The recent searches seem to be focused on three topics, Nair said: funds with exposure to crypto, climate and ESG-focused funds, and funds with strong returns.The crypto market has been hit particularly hard in the recent drop for risk assets, and there are no pure-play bitcoin ETFs on the market in the U.S. However, Nair said that investors seem to be interested in how fund managers who were previously bullish on crypto have responded to the sell-off.""It seems that from the searches, there is interest in funds and fund managers that hold significant crypto-related holdings, Coinbase  being an example. And in particular, there are searches that are asking are fund managers increasing the holdings of Coinbase, or increasing the holdings of crypto,"" Nair said.The data could be seen as evidence of investor resilience in the face of a brutal sell-off that's pushed the Nasdaq 28% off its record. Tifin, which was founded in 2018, announced last week that it raised $109 million in a series D funding round despite the tough environment for funding given the Nasdaq bear market. The company counts Franklin Templeton, J.P. Morgan and Hamilton Lane as investors. The series D valued the company at more than $800 million.Even though search interest has seen continued strength, follow-through purchases have grown more slowly, Nair said. However, investors and advisors can use Magnifi for window-shopping while then actually making trades on a different platform."
2022-05-18,"China's share of global bitcoin mining capacity plummeted to zero in July after authorities launched a fresh crackdown on cryptocurrencies.But several underground mining operations have since emerged in the country, with miners taking care to work around Beijing's ban.New research from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance shows that Chinese bitcoin mining activity has quickly rebounded. Bitcoin miners aren't giving up in China despite Beijing's ban on the practice.China was once the world's biggest crypto mining hub, accounting for between 65% to 75% of the total ""hash rate"" — or processing power — of the bitcoin network.But the country's share of global bitcoin mining capacity plummeted to zero in July and August 2021, according to Cambridge University data, after authorities launched a fresh crackdown on cryptocurrencies.Among the steps China took was to abolish crypto mining, the power-intensive process that leads to the creation of new digital currency. That resulted in several miners fleeing to other countries, including the U.S. and Kazakhstan, which borders China.But, as CNBC has previously reported, several underground mining operations have since emerged in China, with miners taking care to work around Beijing's ban.Now, new research from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance shows that Chinese bitcoin mining activity has quickly rebounded. By September 2021, China made up just over 22% of the total bitcoin mining market, data from Cambridge researchers show. It means China is once again a top global player in bitcoin mining — second only to the U.S., which eclipsed China as the largest destination for the sector last year.There is one caveat: The research methodology relies on aggregate geolocation from huge bitcoin mining ""pools"" — which combine computing resources to more effectively mine new tokens — to determine where activity is concentrated in different countries.This approach may be vulnerable to ""deliberate obfuscation"" by some bitcoin miners using a virtual private network (VPN) to conceal their location, researchers said. VPNs make it possible for users to route their traffic through a server in another country, making them handy tools for people in countries like China, where internet usage is heavily restricted.Nevertheless, they added this limitation would ""only moderately impact"" the accuracy of the analysis. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are decentralized. That means the work of processing transactions and minting new units of currency is handled by a distributed network of computers instead of banks and other intermediaries.To facilitate a bitcoin payment, so-called miners need to agree that the transaction is valid. That process entails making complex calculations to work out a puzzle that increases in difficulty as more and more miners join the network, known as the blockchain.

This method of reaching consensus, known as ""proof of work"" consumes a lot of energy — roughly as much as entire countries, such as Sweden and Norway.China has frequently issued warnings about crypto. But its most recent crackdown was arguably the most severe.The world's second-largest economy was dealing with a multi-month energy shortage last year, which led to numerous power cuts.China is still heavily reliant on coal, and is increasing investment in renewable energy in a bid to become carbon neutral by 2060. Authorities see crypto mining as a potential obstacle to that plan.Now, a resurgence of bitcoin production in China has catapulted the country to the second-largest destination for people hoping to find new digital currency — there's still 2 million bitcoins left to be mined. It might be a less profitable endeavor now, though, with the bitcoin price down more than 50% from its November peak.China's National Development and Reform Commission and the People's Bank of China — which have both issued strong warnings against crypto mining and trading — were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.- CNBC's Mackenzie Sigalos and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report"
2022-05-18,"At Block's first investor day since 2017, executives describe how crypto and music-streaming businesses make up an ""ecosystem"" beyond the original card reader. The future of Block, formerly known as Square, will also be focused on CEO Jack Dorsey's long-term belief in the cryptocurrency bitcoin.  ""Calling Block a payments company is like calling Amazon a bookseller,"" CFO Amrita Ahuja tells CNBC. ""We've grown in so many different ways across multiple dimensions."" Block executives no longer want the firm to be seen as a payments pure play.The San Francisco-based company held its first investor day in five years Wednesday, where the C-suite made its case to Wall Street that the money app, along with its crypto and music-streaming businesses, should be valued as an ""ecosystem"" instead.related investing newsMorgan Stanley sees a sign that points to a top in bitcoinTanaya Macheel15 hours ago""Calling Block a payments company is like calling Amazon a bookseller,"" CFO Amrita Ahuja told CNBC in a phone interview. ""We've grown in so many different ways across multiple dimensions.""Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, who formerly ran Twitter, kicked off Wednesday's presentation with a keynote on the evolution of Block and bitcoin's role in it going forward. It's ""difficult"" to fit a company like Block into a single category, he said. ""We are no longer just a payments company,"" Dorsey said during the livestreamed event. ""A lot has changed since our last investor day.""Square was founded in 2009 and made its name by creating a credit card reader for mobile phones. The company expanded its scope to peer-to-peer payments and bank-like products with Cash App. It also acquired Afterpay and Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service. The company also operates an FDIC-insured bank, and it offers stock and cryptocurrency trading.Square's corporate renaming to Block was meant in part to reflect that widening aperture and broader plans around crypto and blockchain. While fintechs were among the best performers during the coronavirus pandemic, Block and its peers have been pummeled in 2022 amid rising interest rates. Ark's Fintech Innovation ETF, a basket of fintech names, is down more than 60% year to date. Block itself has fallen more than 45% in 2022. Still, Block's CFO, Ahuja said the company is outperforming its peers on profitability. Block released updated profit margins Wednesday — an increasingly important metric as investors prioritize the bottom line over growth.Adjusted profit margins for the Square side of the business last year were 34%, and they were 12% for Cash App, according to the company. On the pure-growth side, Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users and 80 million annual actives as of March.""Wall Street analysts are going to want to understand our growth profile, and our margin structure as a company — you can see based on our track record we are outgrowing the rest of the industry,"" Ahuja said. ""We operate in a large and growing market and are still taking share.""Block closed a $29 billion deal to buy Australian fintech company Afterpay earlier this year as it expands into the installment loan market. The CFO highlighted the cross-selling opportunity with roughly 6% of its Cash App users also using AfterPay. The lending sector has become popular for consumers and merchants, along with a surge in online shopping. It spreads out the cost of a larger purchase into four interest-free installments. Despite pushback from consumer watchdogs, Ahuja contended that it's safer than a traditional card because consumers can't take on additional loans if they miss a payment. ""Millennials and Gen Z's are quite frankly skeptical of traditional forms of credit, that leave people in debt spirals,"" she said.Block also acquired Jay-Z's music streaming business Tidal for roughly $300 million last year — at the time a head scratcher for some payment analysts. Dorsey said it was a bet on the creator economy, which he argues will continue to grow as artificial intelligence removes ""more and more of the need for mechanical work.""""This will be a massive economy in the future, and we see an opportunity to be a big part of it, all using the tools and platform we've already built,"" Dorsey said. ""We acquired Tidal because we saw that artists take a path similar to small businesses, and that there's a significant gap in the market around artist tools."" As of the quarter ended in March, bitcoin still only accounted for roughly 5% of Block's gross profits. But executives are betting on crypto as a secular trend in which Block could be well positioned. Dorsey described it as the ""open standard for global money transmission"" and said it will allow Block's ""entire business to move faster globally.""Block first started offering bitcoin trading through the Cash App, and the company holds it on its balance sheet as an alternative to cash. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down more than 50% from its high and has struggled to regain its value so far this year.Block's crypto businesses have expanded to a bitcoin hardware wallet, a bitcoin-mining business, and an open-source business called TBD for developers. On top of that, there's an independent, bitcoin-focused business within Block called Spiral. Dorsey is not as bullish on other cryptocurrencies and said the ""internet requires a currency native to itself, and in looking at the entire ecosystem of technologies to fill this role, it's clear that bitcoin is currently the only candidate.""""Its development may feel slow relative to other candidates, but that's a result of the deliberateness required to preserve the attributes necessary for money storage and transmission,"" Dorsey said."
2022-05-18,"This is an excerpt from the CNBC Make It newsletter. Subscribe here.The Internal Revenue Service may be missing out on more than $50 billion a year from crypto traders not paying their taxes. And the agency is taking notice.In a new analysis released by Barclays last week, managing director Joseph Abate estimated that the tax gap from crypto trades — the difference between how much tax revenue the IRS collects and how much it is owed — may be as much as $50 billion per year.Barclays made its calculation by extrapolating data referenced by the IRS in 2017 to estimate that the current crypto tax gap represents a full 10% of the overall national tax gap.However, the gap is likely much larger, according to Barclays. That's because ""much of the DeFi activity occurring today did not exist four years ago."" DeFi, which stands for decentralized finance, aims to recreate traditional financial systems, such as banks and exchanges, with cryptocurrency. Most run on the Ethereum blockchain.""While all transactions may be visible on the blockchains, if all the counterparties are anonymous, it is difficult for the IRS to figure out who owes taxes,"" Abate writes. ""Without any supporting IRS data, our sense is that the $50 billion estimate for the crypto tax gap is probably too small.""This isn't to say that crypto traders should try to get away with not paying taxes on their gains. Instead, they should be more diligent than ever in reporting, as the IRS has greatly increased its crackdown on would-be crypto tax evaders in recent years.""The IRS has been leaning very hard, investing in both personnel as well as process and form amendments,"" says Austin Woodward, a certified public accountant and CEO of crypto accounting platform TaxBit.For the past two years, the first item that taxpayers have encountered on their 1040 forms after filling out their contact information is a question asking if ""at any time during 2021, did [they] receive, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in any virtual currency,"" which taxpayers must answer under penalty of perjury.""If you answer 'no' and don't report your crypto gains, now, there's intent behind this willful negligence,"" Woodward tells CNBC Make It. Failing to report gains could result in a lengthy IRS audit and possible fines.The best course of action for crypto traders is to be upfront and honest on their taxes about the crypto purchases and sales they make in a given year. Because the IRS audits on a two-year lag, Woodward says that traders who failed to report gains in the past may still get caught.He recommends keeping detailed records of your transactions so that you can answer any questions the agency may have for you. If you need to amend a previous tax return, you can do so electronically with the IRS at this link.""I think the best approach for any cryptocurrency user is to act like it's not anonymous at all,"" he says. ""Just because you feel like you're safe and in the clear a few months after you file your tax return, that is not the case. This thing can linger on for many, many years.""Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Warren Buffett and financial planners agree: When stocks are down, 'don't watch the market closely'"
2022-05-19,"The U.S. affiliate of crypto exchange FTX plans to roll out zero-commission stock trading.FTX U.S. will offer no-fee brokerage accounts, commission-free trading and market and company data.For now, the new service is limited to a small number of U.S. users. The U.S. affiliate of crypto exchange FTX is rolling out zero-commission stock trading as part of a bigger bet that retail investors will want to see their crypto and stock investments in a single place.FTX U.S. will offer no-fee brokerage accounts, commission-free trading, and market and company data, the company announced Thursday. For now, the new service is limited to a small number of U.S. users.As people become more familiar with cryptocurrencies as investment assets, and as investing services become more easily accessible to a growing number of retail investors, FTX is counting on users growing weary of managing various apps and accounts for their financial activity, according to FTX U.S. President Brett Harrison. The company is hoping to become a one-stop shop for retail investors, he said.""If they want to invest in stocks, they're not going to want to have to split their savings between two different apps, or have to move money around between two different accounts,"" Harrison told CNBC's ""Crypto World"" on Thursday. ""They'd like to be able to have one holistic experience where they can invest in multiple asset classes from a single app and experience. That's what we're hoping to provide by combining stocks and crypto into the same application for our user,"" he said.The product, called FTX Stocks, will initially route orders to Nasdaq through its clearing firm, Embed, Harrison said, adding the company will not receive any payment for order flow, citing ""a growing retail concern around transparency and fairness around order routing."" The back-end payments that brokers receive for directing clients' trades to market makers came under scrutiny last year during the Robinhood-GameStop trading frenzy, which brought more retail investors into the market.Instead, FTX Stocks is more of a customer-acquisition play, Harrison said. While FTX U.S. may initially lose money on stock trades, it hopes to recoup those losses in other ways, including through its crypto-trading service and selling its basic crypto services to other brokers and financial services providers.""To start, this isn't going to be a profitable endeavor for us,"" Harrison said. ""Our goal is to be able to add this additional service for our customers to help bolster our existing business.""Customers will have the option to fund their accounts with fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC in addition to normal dollar deposits through wire transfer, ACH or credit card. There will be no minimum required balances for customers to maintain and users will be able to trade some securities fractionally.The news, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes as the S&P 500 teeters on the edge of a bear market. Stocks — and cryptocurrencies — have been in a brutal sell-off for most of this year. The Nasdaq Composite suffered its worst month in April since 2008.FTX U.S. made the announcement a week after the company's owner, Sam Bankman-Fried, bought a minority stake in Robinhood, making him the third-largest shareholder and fueling speculation that he's interested in acquiring the whole company. Shares of Robinhood, which got its start in stock trading and has seen strong customer demand for crypto, have been falling and last week hit an all-time low, about 77% below its July 2021 IPO price.This week, Robinhood revealed plans for its own bigger push into crypto.FTX U.S. also joins fintech brands like Block's Cash App, SoFi and Public in offering trading in both stocks and crypto. Big crypto rivals like Coinbase and Binance do not offer stock trading, with the latter ending its equities product last year."
2022-05-19,"Tether said its holdings of U.S. Treasury bills rose 13% to $39.2 billion, while commercial paper fell 17% to $20.1 billion.The company said it now also owns around $286 million in non-U.S. government bonds.It comes after tether, the digital currency, briefly fell below its intended $1 peg last week. The issuer of the stablecoin tether said in a report that the controversial digital currency is now backed in part by ""non-U.S."" government bonds.Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of sovereign currencies and other traditional assets. Tether, the company behind the token of the same name, aims to track the U.S. dollar.related investing newsHedge funds piled into these stocks in the first quarterYun Li16 hours agoIn its latest so-called ""attestation"" report, Tether said its holdings of U.S. Treasurys rose 13% to $39.2 billion in the first quarter.The amount of commercial paper — short-term loans to companies — Tether owns fell 17% to $20.1 billion in the period, and declined a further 20% since Apr. 1, the company said. Tether's commercial paper holdings have been a concern for regulators and economists due to the potential exposure of money markets.Tether's latest disclosure is notable as it's also the first time the company has revealed it is buying government debt from countries outside the U.S. in addition to Treasury bills.At around $286 million, the amount of non-U.S. bonds is only a minor portion of the more than $82 billion in assets Tether claims to own. But the source of the funds, and the governments issuing them, isn't clear. Bonds issued by the U.S. government are widely viewed as safe and highly liquid. Debt from other less developed economies is riskier, as it comes with a higher probability of default.Tether was not immediately available for comment on which non-U.S. bonds it has bought.Paolo Ardoino, Tether's chief technology officer, said the ""latest attestation further highlights that Tether is fully backed and that the composition of its reserves is strong, conservative, and liquid.""Tether is meant to maintain a 1-to-1 peg to the dollar at all times. But volatility in cryptocurrencies last week, coupled with panic over the collapse of terraUSD, a competing stablecoin, temporarily dragged tether below $1 on several exchanges. TerraUSD, or UST as it's known, is a so-called ""algorithmic"" stablecoin that attempted to maintain a value of $1 using code rather than cash.Tether is a crucial part of the crypto market. With $74 billion in circulation, it's the world's biggest so-called stablecoin, facilitating billions of dollars' worth of trades each day. Investors often park their cash in tether in times of heightened volatility in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.""This past week is a clear example of the strength and resilience of Tether,"" Ardoino said. ""Tether has maintained its stability through multiple black swan events and highly volatile market conditions.""Still, the amount of cash flowing out of tether has raised fresh questions about the reserves behind it. Tether previously claimed to be backed solely by U.S. dollars. Investors have withdrawn more than $7 billion from Tether in the past week alone. Tether started releasing quarterly financials after a 2021 settlement with the New York attorney general, which accused the company of lying about its stablecoin's backing (Tether admitted no wrongdoing).The documents are signed by MHA Cayman, a little-known accountancy firm based in the Cayman Islands.Some economists and investors aren't convinced by Tether's attestations and are calling for a full audit. The company says such an audit is on the way. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week warned about the risk of a ""bank run"" scenario in which investors flee stablecoins, potentially causing a contagion of other markets. Stablecoins are now a $160 billion market.""The stablecoin market has grown so much that I think there is some systemic risk at this point,"" John Griffin, professor of finance at the University of Texas, told CNBC.

The Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF (SARK) has soared more than 75% year-to-date while the ARKK ETF has fallen more than 55% in the same time period.And now the creator behind the SARK ETF is taking the opposite bet with his latest instrument, the AXS 2X Innovation ETF (TARK). This new long-leveraged ETF is designed to receive two times the return of the ARKK ETF.AXS Investments managing director Matt Tuttle launched the short ETF in response to demand for a way to bet against Wood's ETF. But after seeing the interest in the ARKK ETF, the firm decided to add the ultra-long ETF.   ""The one thing people will agree on is that that's an ETF that's going to move and it's going to have large moves. So we wanted to give investors that tactical ability to play both sides,"" Tuttle told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" in an interview on Monday.""Plus, we think it's an interesting opportunity for some of ARKK shareholders who are really committed to the story,"" Tuttle added.In an interview last month with CNBC's Bob Pisani, ARKK founder Cathie Wood described the SARK ETF as shorting American innovation.Tuttle pushed back against those remarks, saying, ""What we're providing here is tools.

China's state-backed blockchain company is planning its first major international expansion, its CEO told CNBC, as Beijing continues to make the technology a key priority.Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) bills itself as a ""one-stop shop"" to deploy blockchain applications in the cloud, a process that could otherwise be costly and time consuming. It aims to link different blockchains together to help businesses deploy the technology.related investing newsCrypto’s biggest headwinds this year are hurting stablecoins. Here’s what investors need to knowTanaya Macheel10 hours agoHong Kong-headquartered start-up Red Date Technology is one of the founding members of BSN. The company's CEO Yifan He told CNBC that BSN is planning to launch a project called BSN Spartan Network overseas in August.Blockchain came to prominence with the cryptocurrency bitcoin but its definition has since expanded. It refers to a system of shared ledgers of activity, which could be public and available for all to see, or private, where only certain participants can use and modify it. Bitcoin is an example of a public blockchain.BSN's blockchain networks, however, do not operate with any cryptocurrencies because China has cracked down on digital coins.Proponents of blockchain technology say that it can reduce the cost and increase the speed of some business processes. Chinese President Xi Jinping has personally endorsed the technology, elevating it to a national priority. The international plan will be a major push for BSN.The Spartan Network will eventually be made up of half a dozen public blockchains that do not operate with cryptocurrencies. One of those will be a non-crypto version of the Ethereum blockchain when the project launches in August.Blockchain transactions usually cost money. But He said that the fee will be paid in U.S. dollars rather than Ethereum's related cryptocurrency called ether.""The purpose of this is to drop the cost to use public chains to very minimal so that more traditional IT [information technology] systems and business systems can use public chains as part of their systems,"" He said. ""That is why we are working with other major public chain protocols to convince them the mainstream is non-crypto public chains.""The Red Date Technology CEO admitted that not having cryptocurrencies as part of the company's product offering is a challenge. He said BSN Spartan Network will be ""difficult to push in the first or second year because most people in the blockchain industry only understand crypto."" BSN will likely face scrutiny abroad due to its links to the Chinese government. The company is backed by the State Information Center (SIC) which sits under China's powerful National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company, is also behind the project.He said that BSN's Chinese background is a ""huge challenge"" as it expands internationally. ""That is why when we a launch in August we will open source immediately and we are working with a lot of western companies,"" He said.""People will say BSN is from China, it is dangerous. Let me emphasize, BSN Spartan will be open source … we will not access anything from our end.""He also said users will be able to inspect the code behind the project to ensure there are no backdoor access for the Chinese government."
2022-05-22,"Workers have gained considerable leverage in the job market, from wages to benefits and work from home flexibility.A recession would lead to slower job growth and big companies from Facebook to Uber and Netflix are talking about pulling back on hiring, even layoffs.This may lead to some bargaining power losses, but with two job openings for every unemployed person in the current labor market, employees should be able to hold the line better than during past economic downturns. A long-running employee's market had made it difficult for employers to tug the reins and force remote workers back to the office.But times may be changing.Amid various business challenges ranging from market volatility, rising inflation, lagging revenue and a high risk of recession, companies are slowing hiring and, in some cases, letting workers go.Facebook parent Meta, Twitter, and Uber are just some of the companies that have pared back plans for new employees. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to employees that the company ""will treat hiring as a privilege and be deliberate about when and where we add headcount."" A Meta spokesperson told CNBC that ""in light of the expense guidance given for this earnings period, we are slowing its growth accordingly.""Carvana and Robinhood are just two of the companies that went through recent hiring streaks that are now letting workers go. ""We determined that making these reductions to Robinhood's staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers,"" Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev wrote in a blog post announcing the company would be letting go approximately 9% of its 3,800 employees.Netflix just laid off 150 workers.A quickly shifting employer-employee dynamic could give companies the ammunition to take a harder line against the full-time work-at-home arrangements that many employees have pushed for, according to corporate policies experts. In fact, they say more companies are likely to start pressing staffers to come back to the office — at least a few days a week.""The hybrid workforce is not going to go away, but the situation where employees refuse to come to the workplace at all is not likely to hold,"" said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., president and CEO of The Society for Human Resource Management.Before the pandemic, about 10% of the U.S. workforce worked fully remotely, according to SHRM data. ""By the end of 2024, we believe that the number of fully remote workers will go to about 20%. But that still means 80% will be working in the office in some way,"" Taylor said.Since the Bureau of Labor Services began publishing the JOLTS report in 2000, there have been two recessions with very similar trends in job openings, one in 2001 and the other in 2007-2009. What makes the current macroeconomic environment different, according to Jeanniey Walden, workplace expert and CIO of DailyPay, a leader in on-demand pay, is that if a recession is on the horizon, the Fed will be raising rates aggressively, unlike in 2001 and 2008, where the Fed was cutting rates to zero. Layer on top that the job openings are more than twice as high as they were before the last two recessions.Even so, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported a post-pandemic low in remote work at 7.7%, less than half the level it was a year ago. ""Expect that number to continue to decline, with or without a recession,"" she said.""Employers are likely to demand that you meet them midway,"" Taylor Jr. said of work location flexibility, but that midway point may be defined by employers differently — three days in the office, two days at home; two days in the office, three days at home. Some firms may define it as four days in the office.Recent data from New York City shows some shifts in the work arrangements, but the resilience of hybrid.While Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have been adamant about getting people back in the office full-time, other companies have taken a more employee-centric approach, either letting employees choose where to work, or not putting teeth in a policy that requires a certain number of days in the office. As of mid-April, 38% of Manhattan office workers were at a physical workplace on an average weekday, but only 8% were in the office five days a week, according to The Partnership for New York City. The share of office employees fully remote dropped from 54% in late October 2021 to 28% as of late April. Even without taking into account the prospect of a recession and less plentiful jobs, it is forecasting that return to office rates will increase after Labor Day, with nearly half (49%) of workers in the office on an average weekday in September, with the largest bucket (33%) being in three days per week.As more companies start to welcome back employees on a voluntary basis or require them to return, many are facing greater-than-expected resistance. Ford, for example, was surprised at how few employees came back to the office once the option was available, especially given employee polls that suggested they wanted a mix of remote and in-office work.""When we opened our doors on April 4 to our employees to welcome them back into the workplace – those that wanted to come in – the numbers that actually have come back into work have been lower than we expected,"" Ford Chief People and Employee Experience Officer Kiersten Robinson said during a recent CNBC Work virtual event.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon had particularly pushed for workers to return a majority of the workweek, if not all five days, calling this work-from-home era ""an aberration."" Speaking to CNBC's David Faber earlier this month, Solomon said that the bank's in-person attendance at its U.S. offices is between 50% to 60%, down from a pre-pandemic figure of roughly 80%.""We want people to generally come together,"" Solomon told Faber. ""It's going to take some time, you know; behavior shifts take time generally, and I think over the course of the next couple years, our organization will generally come together."" Right now, it's still very much an employee's market, so many companies are still walking a fine line when it comes to flexibility. Some companies, for instance, officially require employees to work in the office three days a week but aren't coming down hard on those who only come in for two.""It's really hard to go back to something restrictive once you've had more freedom,"" said Lori Dann, founder of the Presidents' Leadership Council, a forum for small business presidents, owners and partners.Companies are especially wary of rocking the boat, given that a record 47 million people quit their jobs in 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Gartner predicts that U.S. employee annual voluntary turnover is likely to jump nearly 20% this year from a pre-pandemic annual average, which would mean 37.4 million people quitting their jobs in 2022, according to the research and consulting firm. On top of that, the job market has remained very tight with the number of employment openings exceeding the pool of available workers by 5.6 million in March.""Companies are getting a lot of resistance getting people back to the office,"" Dann said. ""Whenever the job market changes back to an employer market, they may be more forceful, but I don't think there's any way to do that now.""Many companies, however, are losing patience with employee demands for fully remote work, Taylor said. He offered the example of Apple, which in April started requiring corporate workers to come in once a week. The company earlier this month ramped that up to two days a week and the plan was to require three days a week starting on May 23.The policy, which also allows staffers to work fully remote for up to four weeks a year, met resistance among employees. The group published an open letter, which garnered more than 3,000 signatures, decrying the ""rigid policies"" being promulgated. Apple also lost a top AI executive to Google, who bolted based on its return to work policy. While the company could stick to its guns, it has temporarily delayed its plan to require three days in the office, citing Covid concerns. The two-day requirement remains in place.For many companies, being in the office is an important part of their culture, Taylor said. Other employers, too, are going to be more willing to say, ""If you don't like what we're offering, find another place to work,"" he said. For now, many companies including Amgen, Clorox, DoorDash, Spotify, Splunk, and TIAA continue to offer hybrid and remote options to eligible employees, often depending on the role. These companies say that many employees continue to opt to work at home, at least some of the time. And many companies say their policies are subject to ongoing review.""We have no plans to change at this time, but we will continue to seek feedback from our employees and make any necessary adjustments,"" an Amgen spokesperson said.""Coming into the office remains voluntary at this time, unless a role must be performed in an office,"" said Kristen Robinson, chief people officer at Splunk. ""We expect teams to decide how they work together and when they come together in person,"" she said.For its part, Spotify, which gives employees the choice where to work, said it will conduct a two-year research initiative to further understand the impact of work-from-home on energy, innovation, collaboration and wellbeing. As for relative bargaining power, there is no question that workers today are benefiting from an unprecedented labor imbalance. A recession means fewer new job opportunities for workers, but the labor market currently has nearly two job openings for every unemployed person, giving workers significant leverage to pick and choose the career opportunity that works best for them.""This has impacted everything from base pay to signing bonuses to remote work status,"" Walden said. ""As the labor supply-demand imbalance shrinks, it will undoubtedly impact bargaining power.""But the degree to which the power of balance shifts may not be as significant as in past recessions, according to Richard Wahlquist, president and CEO of the American Staffing Association. ""The nation's employers were dealing with skills shortages before Covid triggered the last recession. Workers with skills in high demand today will likely be in high demand even when the economy tips back into a recession,"" he said.Job seekers will likely receive fewer offers in the coming weeks and months as companies tighten their belts and become more scrupulous in bringing on new talent, said William Chamberlain, careers expert and head of marketing at Hirect, but he doesn't believe workers will lose the footing they've gained over the past two years.""Workers won't be keen to simply give up that balance, and employers must realize satisfied workers are more loyal and productive than their disgruntled counterparts. In other words, it's too early to take a job out of fear. Recession or not, job seekers should keep their expectations high and not sell themselves short,"" Chamberlain said.This includes areas where employers have become more employee-centric, from the types of benefits they offer to workers, to signing bonuses and enhanced workplace flexibility.""While sign-on bonuses may diminish, employers will continue to aggressively compete for qualified talent. There's no turning back. Economic cycles happen. Workers will continue to benefit from the renewed focus on employee engagement,"" Wahlquist said."

SpaceX is raising a massive round of fresh funding, CNBC has learned, sending the private company's valuation to about $127 billion.The space venture is looking to bring in up to $1.725 billion in new capital, at a price of $70 per share, according to a company-wide email on Friday obtained by CNBC. Notably, SpaceX split its stock price 10-for-1 in February, which reduced the common stock to $56 a share – with the new valuation representing a 25% increase.SpaceX is also conducting a secondary sale to company insiders and existing shareholders for up to $750 million in common stock. The company conducts these secondary offerings regularly, as a way for long-time stockholders to sell equity, given that SpaceX remains private more than 20 years since its founding.Details of the cash infusion were not previously reported. The New York Post first reported SpaceX was looking to bring in more funding, and noted, citing unnamed sources, that the capital increase has seen ""tepid demand"" so far.The company's valuation has soared in the last few years as SpaceX has raised billions to fund work on two capital-intensive projects: the next generation rocket Starship and its global satellite internet network Starlink.The company's funding round comes as founder and CEO Elon Musk is embroiled in sexual harassment allegations reportedly from a former SpaceX jet flight attendant. The billionaire has denied the claims made against him as ""wild accusations."" The flight attendant reportedly did not sue SpaceX, and instead reached a $250,000 severance agreement in 2018."

Investors have yanked more than $10 billion out of tether in the past two weeks amid heightened regulatory scrutiny over stablecoins.Tether, the world's largest stablecoin, has seen its circulating supply plunge from a record $84.2 billion on May 11 to around $73.3 billion as of Monday, according to data from CoinGecko. About $1 billion was withdrawn late Friday evening.related investing newsIt’s been a month since the big Shapella upgrade. Here’s how Ethereum has changed since thenTanaya Macheela day agoThe cryptocurrency, which is meant to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, temporarily dipped as low as 95 cents on May 12 after another type of stablecoin, terraUSD — or UST — plunged well below $1. That resulted in a sell-off in UST's associated luna token, which in turn wiped out more than $40 billion in holders' wealth.The fallout from the collapse of Terra, the blockchain behind UST and luna, sent shockwaves through the crypto market, with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tumbling sharply. That's causing concern for regulators.""Whenever there's a failure or a catastrophe in crypto, the fear is always that someone will misread the situation and overcorrect in a position that's not helpful for the entire community writ large,"" Kathleen Breitman, a co-creator of the Tezos blockchain, told CNBC.""As much as I relish seeing things that don't make sense fail, there's always a tinge of like, 'Are people going to extrapolate from this that everything that's a stablecoin is unsound?' That's always the big fear."" Unlike tether, UST wasn't backed by fiat currency held in a reserve. Instead, it relied on some complex engineering where price stability was maintained through the destruction and creation of UST and its sister token luna. Investors were lured in by the promise of 20% savings yields from Anchor, Terra's flagship lending platform, a rate many investors said was unsustainable.Terra creator Do Kwon had also accumulated billions of dollars' worth of bitcoin and other tokens through his Luna Foundation Guard fund, but nearly all of the funds were depleted in a futile effort to save UST. ""While we have witnessed an erosion in investor confidence, we should not throw all stablecoins out the window,"" said Stephen Aschettino, U.S. head of fintech at Norton Rose Fulbright.""So many companies want to become involved with cryptocurrency but are still figuring out how to best navigate it. I think the industry as a whole would welcome greater regulatory clarity.""Nevertheless, the panic over UST has drawn attention to other stablecoins — tether, in particular.Regulators and economists have long questioned whether Tether has enough assets in its reserves to justify its stablecoin's purported peg to the dollar.""USDT is, quite simply, fully backed by collateral,"" Tether said in a statement Monday.""It has maintained its peg because every USDT is redeemable for dollars via Tether, and as such any time the price goes below $1 investors can earn a profit by buying USDT for a discount and redeeming it with Tether.""The company previously claimed tether was backed one-to-one by dollars in a bank account, but subsequently revealed it was using other assets including commercial paper — short-term corporate debt — and even digital tokens as collateral after a settlement with the New York attorney general.Last week, Tether said it reduced the amount of commercial paper it owns and increased its holdings of U.S. Treasury bills. For the first time, the British Virgin Islands-based firm said it also holds some foreign government debt. Tether declined to comment further on the source of its funds, but said it is pursuing a more thorough audit of its reserves."

2022-05-24,"WASHINGTON —Democratic billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried says he could spend $1 billion or more in the 2024 election, which would easily make him the biggest-ever political donor in a single election.Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, said in a podcast interview released Tuesday that he expects to give ""north of $100 million"" in the next presidential election and has a ""soft ceiling"" of $1 billion, with his spending likely to be on the higher end if former President Donald Trump runs again. That kind of money would be ""in a league of its own,"" said Alex Baumgart, a researcher with the campaign finance tracker Open Secrets.Bankman-Fried, who is estimated to be worth more than $20 billion and says he has already given away more than $200 million to various causes, cautions that his political plans are still in flux and will be contingent on what the landscape looks like. ""I would guess north of $100 million. As for how much more than that, I don't know. It really does depend on what happens. It's really dependent on exactly who's running where for what,"" he said on the Pushkin Industries podcast What's Your Problem. ""[$1 billion] is a decent thing to look at as a — I would hate to say hard ceiling, because who knows what's going to happen between now and then — but at least sort of as a soft ceiling.""That amount of money would be unprecedented and shatter existing records several times over — at least if it was all spent as so-called ""hard money,"" which includes donations to candidates, parties, super PACs and other groups who have to report to the Federal Election Commission.It's impossible to know how much other wealthy donors have spent to influence politics via so-called ""dark money,"" which includes donations to groups like think tanks and nonprofit advocacy organizations.The most hard money any individual has spent in any election cycle was $218 million in 2020 by the late Republican casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, according to Open Secrets.The Adelsons have competed in recent years to be the biggest donors in the country with Democratic billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, who have each spent between $75 and $150 million in the last three elections (not including the money they spent on their own presidential campaigns in 2020).Liberal billionaire George Soros earlier this year committed to spending $125 million toward this year's midterms.More from NBC News:Trump faces biggest test since 2020 in Georgia primariesISIS operative in U.S. plotted to assassinate George W. Bush, FBI allegesSuspect in fatal NYC subway shooting of Goldman Sachs employee is in custodyBeyond those well-known names, even mega-donors typically top out around $40 to $60 million per election cycle, so even $100 million would put Bankman-Fried among a tiny handful of the country's biggest donors.""If this is sustained and it's actually fully realized, it could have an immense impact on U.S. politics,"" said Baumgart, comparing the scope of the potential spending to that of the Adelsons, the Koch Brothers' donor network and Bloomberg.""The question is, does his spending bear fruit in the midterms? And ultimately I think that will wade pretty heavily in his decision to keep this going or not,"" Baumgart added.Bankman-Fried has spent at least $20 million so far this year supporting candidates in Democratic congressional primaries who have pledged to push the U.S. government to invest in stopping the next pandemic.Bankman-Fried is an adherent of Effective Altruism, a utilitarian philosophy which promotes ideas like earning lots of money in order to give it all away.He went into finance and started donating large portions of his paychecks long before he made his first billion and still lives fairly modestly, with roommates and a Toyota Corolla, with a stated goal of giving away the vast majority of his fortune as he makes it.Critics, however, question the motives behind Bankman-Fried's increasing involvement in politics, noting that the crypto industry has been stepping up its lobbying in Washington as lawmakers and regulators look to apply new rules to the largely unregulated industry that has likely destroyed more fortunes than it has made.He's one of several crypto donors who have started spending large amounts of money in politics seemingly out of nowhere, just as the industry comes under scrutiny.And Bankman-Fried's biggest political investment so far did not pay off. He spent at least $12 million backing a little-known Oregon congressional candidate who ended up getting crushed in a Democratic primary last week.In the podcast interview, Bankman-Fried said he would ""do it a bit differently"" if he could do it again, but fundamentally stood by the decision to intervene in the race, saying he always viewed it as a low-probability, high-reward situation.""If you're donating to political races that you think your candidate are 99 percent to win, you're almost certainly doing something wrong,"" he said, since the candidate doesn't need the help.

Asked when he thinks the world will move away from using smartphones to using smart glasses and other devices that are worn on the face, Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark said it will definitely happen by the time 6G arrives in 2030.U.S. tech giants such as Meta, Google and Microsoft are working on new augmented reality headsets that could one day replace the smartphone. Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark expects 6G mobile networks to be in operation by the end of the decade but he doesn't think the smartphone will be the most ""common interface"" by then.Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos Tuesday, Lundmark said he expects 6G to hit the commercial market around 2030, which coincides roughly with when Huawei expects to see the technology on the market.Headquartered in Finland, Nokia builds telecoms networks that enable phones and other internet-enabled devices to communicate with one another.Asked when he thinks the world will move away from using smartphones to using smart glasses and other devices that are worn on the face, Lundmark said it will happen before 6G arrives.

2022-05-25,"The Silicon Valley firm announced a new $4.5 billion fund for backing crypto and blockchain companies on Wednesday.Partners Arianna Simpson and Chris Dixon liken the long-term opportunity in crypto to ""the next major computing cycle,"" after PCs in the 1980s, the internet in the 1990s and mobile computing in the early 2000s.Bear markets are often when the best opportunities come about, said Simpson. Andreessen Horowitz plans to plow billions of dollars into crypto start-ups while digital asset markets are in a rut.The Silicon Valley firm announced a new $4.5 billion fund for backing crypto and blockchain companies on Wednesday. It marks Andreessen's fourth fund for the asset class and brings its total raised for crypto and blockchain investments to $7.6 billion. The firm plans to invest in both the cryptocurrencies behind projects and in company equity.Andreessen's first crypto-focused fund was launched four years ago, during a downturn now known as ""crypto winter.""""Bear markets are often when the best opportunities come about, when people are actually able to focus on building technology rather than getting distracted by short-term price activity,"" Arianna Simpson, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz told CNBC in a phone interview.Cryptocurrencies have slid significantly from their all-time highs, with bitcoin down more than 50% since its November peak, and they remain tightly correlated to higher growth tech stocks, which have undergone a major slide this year. Earlier in May, the crash of stablecoin TerraUSD shook investor sentiment and caught the attention of regulators.But Simpson said investors should not worry about the firm's bets.""The technical diligence and the other kinds of diligence that we do are a key part of of making sure that projects meet our bar,"" she said. ""While our pace of investment has been high, we continue to invest really in only the top echelon of founders.""Simpson and partner Chris Dixon liken the long-term opportunity in crypto to the next major computing cycle, after PCs in the 1980s, the internet in the 1990s and mobile computing in the early 2000s.Andreessen Horowitz is known for early bets on Lyft, Pinterest and Slack, and made its first major crypto investment with Coinbase in 2013. The firm has since backed a variety of start-ups in the crypto and NFT space, including Alchemy, Avalanche, Dapper Labs, OpenSea, Solana and Yuga Labs. Earlier this week it invested in Flowcarbon, a carbon-credit trading platform on the blockchain also backed by controversial WeWork founder Adam Neumann.While cryptocurrencies may be struggling to regain momentum, money flowing into private companies is at all-time highs. Blockchain start-ups brought in a record $25 billion in venture capital dollars last year, according to recent data from CB Insights. That figure is up eightfold from a year earlier.The flood of investment into so-called ""Web3"" start-ups trying to build businesses on blockchain technology has inspired scorn from some tech luminaries. Two of the world's best-known tech billionaires, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, have been among those questioning ""Web3."" Dorsey argues VCs and their limited partners are the ones who will ultimately end up owning Web3 and it ""will never escape their incentives,"" he tweeted, calling it a ""centralized entity with a different label.""""The people who are skeptical are not where we are, which is again in the fortunate position of being able to talk to these brilliant builders all day,"" Simpson said. ""The other thing I would add is that many of the skeptics are the titans of Web 2.0 — they have been very much in a position to profit from and benefit from the closed platforms.""Clarification: While Andreessen Horowitz was a seed investor in Brbn, the company that later pivoted to become photo-sharing platform called Instagram, it passed on the chance to invest in Instagram itself."
2022-05-25,"The U.S. has dropped the ball on crypto regulation, according to Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce, and she says the knock-on effects of that failure keep her up at night.""There's a lot of fraud in this space, because it's the hot area of the moment. ...The other piece that does concern me is the way that we've sort of dropped the regulatory ball,"" Peirce told CNBC on the sidelines of the DC Blockchain Summit this week.""We're not allowing innovation to develop and experimentation to happen in a healthy way, and there are long-term consequences of that failure,"" Peirce said. WASHINGTON — The U.S. has dropped the ball on crypto regulation, according to Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce, and she says the knock-on effects of that failure keep her up at night.""There's a lot of fraud in this space, because it's the hot area of the moment,"" Peirce told CNBC on the sidelines of the DC Blockchain Summit this week. ""The other piece that does concern me is the way that we've sort of dropped the regulatory ball.""She continued, ""We're not allowing innovation to develop and experimentation to happen in a healthy way, and there are long-term consequences of that failure.""The comments come as the crypto market meltdown continues.A broad sell-off in digital assets has erased more than half a trillion dollars from the entire market in the space of a few weeks thanks, in part, to turmoil in a subset of cryptocurrencies dubbed stablecoins.The name comes from the fact that these digital currencies are specifically designed to be stable, with values pegged to the price of real-world assets such as commodities like gold, or fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. The price moves of stablecoins are seldom worth mentioning because they're not supposed to fluctuate much. But the collapse of UST — one of the more popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins — had a contagion effect across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Those shock waves have also lit a fire under lawmakers and regulators.""We can go after fraud and we can play a more positive role on the innovation side, but we have to get to it, we've got to get working,"" said Peirce.""I haven't seen us willing to do that work so far."" The SEC's job description when it comes to regulating cryptocurrencies is amorphous.Wall Street's top regulator oversees securities, and until recently it was difficult getting Chair Gary Gensler to pin down which of the more than 19,500 cryptos fall under his jurisdiction, versus the commodity tokens which would be better left to law enforcers at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.But in recent testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, Gensler offered some clarity, saying the SEC has jurisdiction ""over probably a vast number"" of the cryptocurrencies in circulation. The SEC chief also conceded that bitcoin was ""maybe"" not under its purview — which, for him, were strong words on the subject.Gensler's recent take on bitcoin's regulatory jurisdiction runs in parallel to ex-SEC chief Jay Clayton, who previously said that cryptocurrencies are ""replacements for sovereign currencies,"" and if you ""replace the dollar, the euro, the yen with bitcoin ... that type of currency is not a security.""The SEC has spent the last few months beefing up its roster and broadening its remit with respect to digital asset regulation.In April, Gensler said Wall Street's top regulator plans to register and regulate crypto platforms, and earlier this month, the agency announced it would almost double the staff responsible for protecting investors in cryptocurrency markets — bringing its Crypto Assets and Cyber team up to 50 dedicated positions.""The crypto exchanges should come in and register,"" continued Gensler on Capitol Hill last week, ""Or, frankly, we're going to continue to bring, use what Congress has given us, in our enforcement and examination functions.""Gensler also recently told House lawmakers that the rules are ""actually quite clear."" If you are raising money from the public and the public anticipates a profit based on the efforts of that sponsor, that's a security, according to the SEC chair. Gensler says that differs from a commodity, which both lacks an issuer and also has no public buyer anticipating a return based on the efforts of the single party behind the product. But a lot of participants would welcome more clarity from lawmakers. The SEC's Peirce tells CNBC that while the SEC is already acting using the authority that it has, she thinks ""it would be helpful if Congress came in and said, 'SEC, here's the role we think you should be playing. CFTC, here's the role for you.'""""One could argue that the SEC would be a good regulator of retail exchanges, if we decide to have a federal regulator, but again, that's really up to Congress to make that call,"" continued Peirce, who noted that there is a lot of work to be done within existing authorities since traditional financial institutions want to get involved in crypto. ""They need regulatory clarity from us in order to do that.""Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., are aiming to provide that clarity with a bill that lays out a comprehensive framework for regulating the crypto industry and divvies up oversight among regulators like the SEC and CFTC. Lummis tells CNBC that they hope this regulatory blueprint for digital assets ""hits the sweet spot between regulation that is clear and understood, and does not stifle innovation.""But until Congress passes some hard and fast rules around how to regulate crypto, the dynamic will remain regulation by enforcement.Since the SEC launched a unit dedicated to crypto asset oversight in 2017, it has brought more than 80 enforcement actions against crypto asset offerings and platforms.The agency's lawsuit against San Francisco-based start-up Ripple could be a bellwether court battle.In 2020, the SEC alleged that Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company's executive chairman violated securities laws when it sold $1.4 billion worth of XRP, the world's sixth-largest cryptocurrency. Amid the wider sell-off, XRP is down 42% in the last 30 days, according to CoinGecko.Ripple says its token is not a security — and so goes the continued confusion over which digital coins fall into which regulatory bucket.The ambiguity at one point also extended to ether, the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, when in 2018, an SEC director said that ""the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.""How the Ripple legal battle plays out could be a sign of things to come — and could potentially force the SEC's hand on defining which of the nearly 20,000 crypto tokens fall under its jurisdiction."
2022-05-25,"Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government used social media to ask for cryptocurrency donations.On March 19, the government's ""Aid for Ukraine"" fund said it had raised more than $60 million worth of cryptocurrency.But two months later, on May 19, the total raised was worth $51.5 million. Ukraine, battered by three months of war, plans to continue to tap crypto investors to help raise funds after a plunge in prices decimated the country's fundraising efforts in May.Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the Ukrainian government used social media to ask for cryptocurrency donations. Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov sought to rally crypto investors this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos.On March 19, the government's ""Aid for Ukraine"" fund said it had raised more than $60 million worth of cryptocurrency. But two months later, on May 19, the total raised was worth $51.5 million, Ukraine's deputy minister for digital transformation Alex Bornyakov said.Cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply in recent weeks. Bitcoin has lost more than 20% of its price so far in May, following a 17% drop in April, highlighting the risks faced by holders of the highly volatile assets.All the funds raised in the ""Aid for Ukraine"" fund were stored in cryptocurrency but the government was able to spend $45 million of it on equipment for Ukraine's army before the crash, Bornyakov said in written responses to Reuters questions.Ukraine has been funding its war effort in part with cryptocurrencies. The year before the war saw a rise in bitcoin donations to Ukrainian volunteer groups, some of which supplied equipment to government forces.While crypto may provide some much-needed funds, Kiev estimated it needs $15 billion over the next three months to help its war-torn economy recover. Despite the volatility, crypto assets still appeal to Ukrainians seeking to raise funds.Ukraine's largest independent beer brand, Obolon, plans to sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to help it distribute free water for humanitarian aid.It is following the lead of Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation, which has raised 286 ether (around $550,000) with its online ""Museum of War"" NFT collection.Obolon plans to sell 5,000 NFTs for 0.1 ether (around $200), which can be exchanged for a commemorative beer bottle after the war.""This project is directly to help us continue to scale, because today the financial situation in the company is difficult because in Ukraine the economic situation is very difficult,"" Olexander Chub, Obolon's director of foreign trade, said in a video interview."
2022-05-26,"This story is part of CNBC Make It's Millennial Money series, which details how people around the world earn, spend and save their money.In late 2018, Brian Jung, then 21, decided to drop out of college to pursue entrepreneurship full-time. His South Korean immigrant parents were taken aback: Jung had some part-time e-commerce side hustles that earned about $200 a day, but they didn't offer the long-term financial security of a college degree. Jung also had a YouTube channel, which was more of a hobby than a full-fledged business. But he was confident in his decision: ""I had to tell my parents, 'I know you've worked really hard and I know how scary this is going to be, but I'm not going to finish school,'"" Jung tells CNBC Make It.He was determined to make things work, despite the uncertainty. And he did. Now 25, Jung has pivoted to YouTube full-time. He earned around $3.7 million in the last year, largely from his personal finance-focused channel, which has more than 1 million subscribers.Looking back, he says the decision to drop out of college to become an entrepreneur was a ""pivotal moment"" in his life: It allowed him to put more time into the channel and grow it into a business. Here's how Jung budgeted his money in March 2022. Investments: $50,000Rent: $3,745 Discretionary: $3,350 for shopping, gifts, donations and laundryFood: $2,534, with $1,645 spent on meals at restaurantsSupport for his parents: $2,478Subscriptions: $223 spent on gym memberships, Disney+Renters insurance: $176Gas: $92While the bulk of his earnings go toward operating costs and taxes for the business, Jung puts roughly $50,000 into various investments each month, including cryptocurrencies, NFTs, collectible items and angel investor ventures.Jung says his crypto assets are long-term investments, and that he doesn't plan to change his investing strategy despite the recent downturn in crypto markets. He does say he wants to continue diversifying his portfolio by investing in more cash-producing businesses.Aside from investments, Jung pays himself $400,000 a year, or about $33,000 per month, to cover living expenses, taxes and gifts.Jung's biggest living expense is a three-bedroom apartment in Rockville, Maryland, which doubles as his office space. His business covers the utility expenses. He also put a $145,000 down payment on a home worth $1.8 million, which he plans to move into in 2023. It's a new development that's currently being built.Jung drives an Audi RS7, which he bought with his YouTube revenue. He also owns a 2019 Toyota Tacoma, which he recently gave to his parents. He still covers the $600 monthly payments for the truck, as well as his parents' $1,878 monthly mortgage payments.Recently, Jung purchased a 2021 Lamborghini Huracan for $290,000. He put $100,000 down on the car and will finance the rest.In addition to splurging on meals out, Jung gets glass bottles of premium spring water delivered for $249 per month. It's worth it, he says: ""It makes me feel better, lets me feel more clear in my head."" Jung has memberships at a gym and a rock-climbing facility. Beyond that, most of his subscriptions — including access to Netflix, Spotify and Amazon Prime — are covered by perks from his 14 credit cards. Raised in Silver Spring, Maryland, Jung grew up in a low-income household. His mother cut hair in a salon and his father worked long hours as a contractor installing hardwood floors. Sometimes, they struggled to make ends meet.Mottos about saving money were the norm: ""Don't spend a lot. Don't eat out that much. Don't drive too fast or you'll use up more gas. Maximize every coupon possible, every discount possible — that's what I grew up with,"" says Jung. Jung says he didn't feel deprived. He had friends, enjoyed fishing with his father on weekends and was into gaming and cars. But as one of the few Korean-Americans at his middle school, he also felt like he didn't fit in. He became a self-described ""troublemaker,"" regularly disrupting class and getting into fights.In 10th grade, Jung got kicked out of school. He joined an educational program that counseled that counseled misbehaving students — a turning point in his life. ""I used to have this victim mentality,"" he says. ""I used to complain all the time."" But when he saw that version of himself in other students in the program, he decided the path he was on was a dead-end.""I told myself, 'I'm not going to live my life this way,'"" Jung says.He started to focus on self-improvement: working harder, working out and doing better in school. After six months, he had a 4.0 GPA and was allowed to return to his high school, where he excelled at rugby. Jung started posted videos to YouTube in 2013. As a teenager, he made content about video games and fishing. He started his channel about personal finance and entrepreneurship during college in 2018.That same year, he earned a general studies associate's degree at Montgomery College, a prerequisite for a career in law enforcement. From there, the plan was to transfer to the University of Maryland for a bachelor's degree in criminology.Instead, Jung decided to pursue his businesses full-time.""In the beginning, YouTube did not pay me anything. But I realized the downfalls of [the e-commerce] businesses and saw the advantages of YouTube,"" he says. ""I didn't have to rely on clients. I didn't have to work with other people. I didn't have to scale and buy an office and get hundreds of employees.""By December 2019, Jung was fully focused on YouTube. His most successful videos were credit card reviews. At that point, the channel had about 6,000 subscribers and was making $200 to $300 a day, he says. In 2021, amid the retail investor craze and cryptocurrency's bull run, the channel really took off. ""It took me years to get my first 100,000 subscribers, but in less than one year I gained 900,000 subscribers,"" Jung says.Between affiliate marketing, Patreon subscribers, ads and sponsorships, Jung's business brings in just over $300,000 per month. He now has four full-time employees helping him produce videos.Combined with a recently purchased stake in a Japanese barbecue restaurant that brings in another $5,500 per month, Jung made almost $3.7 million last year. Jung says he hopes to keep growing the number of subscribers to his YouTube channel, pursue investment opportunities and build up more wealth to ensure his financial independence. ""My goal in the next few years is to have the largest crypto and personal finance YouTube channel,"" he says. He also wants to invest in more properties, including a new one for his parents, as well as an e-commerce clothing business.""I want to keep building,"" says Jung. ""I just want to create a future generation for my family where no one has to worry about money again.""What's your budget breakdown? Share your story with us for a chance to be featured in a future installment.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: This is Kevin O'Leary's No. 1 job interview tip "
2022-05-26,"Bitcoin's recent slide has left the digital token well below its fair price, giving the cryptocurrency ""significant upside"" now, JPMorgan Chase said in a research note this week.The bank said bitcoin was undervalued by 28%, and put its price target for the coin, which was trading at just above $29,600 on Thursday afternoon, at $38,000 according to Markets Insider. Bitcoin fell below $26,000 earlier this month for the first time since December 2020, just as stock markets have been similarly pummeled — largely due to inflation fears.""The past month's crypto market correction looks more like capitulation relative to last January/February, and going forward, we see upside for Bitcoin and crypto markets more generally,"" strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote on Wednesday.JPMorgan's positive outlook is notable because CEO Jamie Dimon is a longtime cryptocurrency skeptic. Dimon has said that he ""personally think[s] that bitcoin is worthless,"" though he has acknowledged that many of his clients feel differently.""I'm not a bitcoin supporter.

2022-05-26,"Rohit Chopra leads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal agency whose mission is to protect consumers from ""abusive and deceptive financial practices.""As the director of the CFPB, he is keeping a close eye on trouble spots that could potentially cause another financial crisis.With inflation significantly impacting household budgets for millions of Americans, Chopra is focused on how financial products and services are being used or misused.  Chopra said housing and mortgage debt are topping his watchlist right now.""There are a lot of metro areas where first-time homebuyers are almost locked out,"" he said in an exclusive interview at CFPB headquarters in Washington. ""They're competing with private equity buyers, they're competing with cash buyers.More from Invest in You:Former Fed vice chair sees recession likelihood at up to 60%Money stress is taking toll on Americans' mental healthInflation costing Americans $341 a month more""I think that's a cause for concern about how we can get people into their first home,"" Chopra said. ""We want to make sure that we have high-quality servicing that is not leading to preventable foreclosures, and really making sure that we keep the housing market stable and resilient, even through the various economic cycles,"" Chopra said.Yet he said he sees signs of stress among many Americans who are again making the mortgage payments they'd paused as part of Covid relief at the height of the pandemic.""We are seeing some increases, as expected, in distress and foreclosure, but it's certainly not at a panic level,"" Chopra said. ""But we are keeping a close eye on that to make sure that those servicers are serving borrowers well.""Chopra said consumers are also taking on more credit card debt, increasing balances and turning to fast-growing ""buy now, pay later"" products to afford purchases. The Federal Reserve found that more than half of consumers who used buy now, pay later last year did so because they otherwise couldn't afford the purchase.  Chopra said the increasing popularity of BNPL could be clouding the picture for the overall level of consumer debt. ""Under typical credit card laws and regulations, there is a way in which credit card companies have to go through some basic protocols to make sure you can repay the loan,"" he said. ""The problem is that when they're using buy now, pay later for more and more expenses, including groceries and other in-store purchases, they can rack up a lot of debt,"" Chopra said, adding the CFPB has ordered major BNPL companies to provide more information about business plans and practices, as well as how they plan to share information with credit reporting agencies. ""A lot of mortgage lenders and auto lenders are also concerned that they don't have a full picture of consumers' obligations when they're issuing loans,"" he said. ""This is something that is being watched by all corners of the consumer finance markets.  ""The key piece is to make sure we're not creating systems sending people into a spiral of debt that they ultimately cannot repay,"" he added.  Providing a basic level of consumer protection for consumers using cryptocurrency for transactions is another issue the CFPB is addressing. A new Federal Reserve survey found that only 3% of adults used cryptocurrency for purchases or money transfers in 2021, yet among these transactional users of cryptocurrencies, 13% did not have a bank account.Chopra says although crypto is mostly used for what he calls ""speculative trading"" for investors, he recognizes a growing number of consumers are using crypto to buy something or make a payment.The CFPB and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are working together to make sure that crypto companies and other firms don't make false claims about insuring deposits and mislead consumers into thinking they have the same protections as banks.""Many people have compared some advances in crypto to the advances in subprime mortgages over a decade ago,"" Chopra said. ""We want to make sure that people have an understanding of the costs and risks and that there is some help for them when things go wrong.""SIGN UP: Money 101 is an eight-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

Rep. Madison Cawthorn on Friday belatedly disclosed suspected cryptocurrency transactions that earlier this month led the House Ethics Committee to open an investigation into the North Carolina Republican's possible promotion of an asset he secretly owned.Cawthorn, 26, revealed Friday that he bought between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of ""Let's Go Brandon"" cryptocurrency on Dec. 21.

2022-05-27,"This week, backers of the failed cryptocurrency project Terra voted to revive the initiative, with a new luna blockchain and token – and without its controversial algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD.The founders had been seeking the next step forward for the project that crashed as quickly as it took off. The collapse of the Terra project led to combined losses of about $60 billion between the stablecoin, also known as UST, and its sister cryptocurrency luna. Earlier this month, UST plummeted below its $1 peg, which incited a cryptocurrency sell-off.Like many stablecoins, UST was pegged at a 1-to-1 ratio with the dollar. Minting one new UST required ""burning,"" or destroying, one luna. This structure allowed for arbitrage opportunities that were key to maintaining the peg: Users could always swap one luna for UST and vice versa at a guaranteed price of $1, regardless of the market price of either token at the time.""What the Luna ecosystem did was they had a very aggressive and optimistic monetary policy that pretty much worked when markets were going very well, but they had a very weak monetary policy for when we encounter bear markets,"" said Stuti Pandey, a Web3 investor and venture partner at Farmer Fund. This isn't the first time a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin failed. Many in crypto had hoped the Terra project might succeed. But it may be a long time before investors recover from this month's Terra fiasco —and that could put the new project on shaky ground.""There's a big question mark. Whether that will be successful will take a lot of rebuilding trust with investors and builders,"" Felix Hartmann, managing partner of Hartmann Capital, told CNBC.""It will also take a lot of unthankful grind on the part of the founders of luna because they will no longer have the billion-dollar market caps that they had before: They will likely start at the ground floor again,"" he added. ""So it's something worth watching, but perhaps the real fruition — if it ever happens — would be over a year or two. Certainly not this month.""Regulatory hurdles also loom. Stablecoins have been top of mind for regulators for the same exact reasons highlighted by the TerraUSD crash: lack of transparency in the trading of stablecoins and the reserves backing them, as well as market participants' reliance on them to enable trading in other crypto protocols..""Algorithmic stablecoins as an idea are dead,"" said Omid Malekan, a crypto industry veteran and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School.""There are other ones out there not as big as UST and they're all in some state of failure to maintain the peg right now,"" he added. ""That failure has sort of made the other more conservative stablecoins — the fiat-backed ones — seem very appealing in comparison. But the open question now is also what kind of a regulatory response the entire industry gets.""—CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this story."
2022-05-28,"For some investors, confidence is rocked as analysts call the events of the last month a Bear Stearns moment for crypto, comparing the contagion effect of a failed stablecoin project to the fall of a major Wall Street bank that ultimately foretold the 2008 financial crisis and mortgage debt crisis.But senators and regulators told CNBC on the sidelines of the DC Blockchain Summit this week that the spillover effects are contained, crypto investors shouldn't freak out, U.S. regulation is the key to success for cryptocurrencies, and crucially, the crypto asset class isn't going anywhere. WASHINGTON — It's been a brutal few weeks for the crypto market.Half a trillion dollars was wiped off the sector's market cap as terraUSD, one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, imploded virtually overnight.Meanwhile, digital coins such as ether continue to take a beating on the price charts, as the sell-off keeps hammering the industry.Some investors have called the events of the last month a Bear Stearns moment for crypto, comparing the contagion effect of a failed stablecoin project to the fall of a major Wall Street bank that ultimately foretold the 2008 mortgage debt and financial crisis.""It really revealed some deeper vulnerabilities in the system,"" said Michael Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency for the U.S. Treasury Department.""Clearly, you saw contagion, not just from terra to the broader crypto ecosystem, but to tether, to other stablecoins, and I think that's something that wasn't assumed. And I think that's something people have to really pay attention to.""But so far, government officials don't seem to be worried about a crypto crash taking down the broader economy.Several senators and regulators told CNBC on the sidelines of the DC Blockchain Summit this week that the spillover effects are contained, crypto investors shouldn't freak out, U.S. regulation is the key to success for cryptocurrencies, and crucially, the crypto asset class isn't going anywhere.""There need to be rules to this game that make it more predictable, transparent, where there are the needed consumer protections,"" said Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ.""What we don't want to do is choke a new industry and innovation out so that we lose out on opportunities. Or what I'm seeing right now, a lot of these opportunities just move offshore, and we're missing the economic growth and job creation that's a part of it. So this is a really important space if we get the regulation right, that can actually be helpful to the industry and protecting consumers,"" continued Booker. In early May, a popular stablecoin known as terraUSD, or UST, plummeted in value, in what some have described as a ""bank run,"" as investors rushed to pull out their money. At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless.Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tethered to the price of a real-world asset, such as the U.S. dollar. UST is a specific breed, known as an ""algorithmic"" stablecoin. Unlike USDC (another popular dollar-pegged stablecoin), which has fiat assets in reserve as a way to back their tokens, UST depended on computer code to self-stabilize its value.UST stabilized prices at close to $1 by linking it to a sister token called luna through computer code running on the blockchain — essentially, investors could ""destroy"" one coin to help stabilize the price of the other. Both coins were issued by an organization called Terraform Labs, and developers used the underlying system to create other applications such as NFTs and decentralized finance apps.When the price of luna became unstable, investors rushed out of both tokens, sending prices crashing.UST's failure, though infectious, wasn't much of a surprise to some crypto insiders.Coin Metrics' Nic Carter tells CNBC that no algorithmic stablecoin has ever succeeded, noting that the fundamental problem with UST was that it was largely backed by faith in the issuer.Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who is among the most progressive lawmakers on Capitol Hill when it comes to crypto, agrees with Carter.""There are a couple types of stablecoins. The one that failed is an algorithmic stablecoin, very different from an asset-backed stablecoin,"" Lummis told CNBC. She said she hoped consumers could see that not all stablecoins are made equal and that choosing an asset-backed stablecoin is essential.That sentiment was echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.""I would beg you not to pull out of the importance of this world,"" said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva. ""It offers us all faster service, much lower costs, and more inclusion, but only if we separate apples from oranges and bananas.""Georgieva also stressed that stablecoins not backed by assets to support them are a pyramid scheme and emphasized that the responsibility falls to regulators to put up protective guardrails for investors.  ""I think it is likely that we're going to have regulation happen faster because of the events of recent weeks,"" said Securities and Exchange Commission's Hester Peirce, who also noted that stablecoin legislation was already on the docket before the fall of UST.""We have to make sure to...preserve the ability of people to experiment with different models, and do so in a way that fits within regulatory guardrails,"" continued the SEC Commissioner. For Commissioner Caroline Pham of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the UST meltdown highlights just how much action regulators need to take to protect against a possible return of shadow banking — that is, a type of banking system in which financial activities are facilitated by unregulated intermediaries or under unregulated circumstances.Pham says a lot of existing safeguards could do the trick.""It's always faster to stand up a regulatory framework when it's already existing,"" said Pham. ""You're just talking about extending the regulatory perimeter around newer, novel products.""Months before the UST algorithmic stablecoin project failed, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets published a report outlining a regulatory framework for stablecoins. In it, the group divides the stablecoin landscape into two main camps: trading stablecoins and payment stablecoins.Today, stablecoins are typically used to facilitate trading of other digital assets. The report looks to set down best practices to regulate stablecoins to be more widely used as a means of payment.""For those who are like me, bank regulators, we're kind-of historians of money-like instruments,"" said Hsu, whose Office of the Comptroller of the Currency co-authored the report.""This is a really familiar story, and the way to deal with it is prudential regulation. This is why I think some of the options, the proposals for more of a bank kind of regulatory-type approach is a good starting point.""The key question that regulators and lawmakers need to address is whether stablecoins, including the subset of algorithmic stablecoins, are in fact derivatives, says Pham. Generally speaking, a derivative is a financial instrument that allows people to trade on the price fluctuations of an underlying asset. The underlying asset can be almost anything, including commodities such as gold or — according to the way the SEC is currently thinking — a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.The SEC regulates securities, but for everything that is not a security, the CFTC probably has some regulatory touchpoint over it, says Pham.""We have the regulation over derivatives based on commodities, but we also have certain areas ... where we directly regulate spot markets,"" said Pham.""The last time we had ... something blow up like this in the financial crisis — risky, opaque, complex financial products — Congress came up with a solution for that, and that was with Dodd-Frank,"" continued Pham, referring to the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010 in response to the Great Recession. The act included stricter regulation of derivatives, plus new restrictions related to the trading practices of FDIC-insured institutions.  ""If some of these trading stablecoins are, in fact, derivatives, basically, you're talking about a custom basket swap, and then it's the dealer who has to manage the risk associated with that,"" explained Pham. Ultimately, SEC Commissioner Peirce says, Congress calls the shots on how to move forward on crypto regulation. While Wall Street's top regulator is already acting using the authority that it has, Congress needs to divvy up enforcement responsibilities.Lummis has paired up with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., to spell out this division of regulatory labor in a proposed bill.""We're setting it on top of the current regulatory framework for assets, including the CFTC and the SEC,"" Lummis told CNBC. ""We're making sure that the taxation is capital gains and not ordinary income. We've dealt with some accounting procedures, some definitions, we're looking at consumer protection and privacy.""The bill also delves into stablecoin regulation. Lummis says that the bill contemplates the existence of this specific subset of digital assets and requires that they either be FDIC-insured or more than 100% backed by hard assets.Booker says there is a group in the Senate with ""good folks on both sides of the aisle"" coming together and partnering to get it right.""I want there to be the right regulation,"" continued Booker. ""I don't think the SEC is the place to regulate a lot of this industry. Clearly, ethereum and bitcoin, which are the majority of the cryptocurrencies, are more commodity-like.""But until Capitol Hill pushes a bill into law, Pham says that crypto investors need to exercise a whole lot more caution.""If people started to think about some of these really novel crypto tokens as frankly, lottery tickets, when you go and you buy a lottery ticket, you might strike it big, and get rich quick, but you might not,"" said Pham.""I think what I'm worried about is that without appropriate customer protections in place, and the right disclosures, that people are buying some of these crypto tokens thinking that they're guaranteed to strike it rich,"" she said."
2022-05-28,"Tracy McGrady's Ones Basketball League makes its New York debut Memorial Day weekend.The Hall of Famer, who played for several NBA teams including the Magic and the Rockets, is spending under $10 million to back the league.McGrady has been involved in other business ventures, but he told CNBC: ""This is the first time I actually trusted and believed that I can pull this off."" This time, Tracy McGrady is trusting his ideas.The basketball Hall of Famer has funded real estate projects, he's backed a sports and entertainment agency, and committed to a cryptocurrency partnership before the sector lost billions in value. Now, McGrady is investing in his own company, Ones Basketball League, or OBL, which makes its New York premiere this weekend.""I've always invested in other people's ideas and other people's vision,"" McGrady told CNBC in an interview. ""Not once did I ever trust mine. I didn't have the confidence to think mine was good enough. I didn't trust my ideas or decision-making when it came to my vision.""He added: ""This is the first time I actually trusted and believed that I can pull this off.""McGrady, 43, self-funds OBL, an over-18 league through that tours seven cities from April to July. It pairs players in one-on-one games, a staple of playground basketball. Picture Ice Cube's Big 3 league, but with fewer players and no former NBA stars.McGrady will pay just under $10 million, all told, including the $250,000 prize for the eventual OBL champion. He has partnered with longtime sports executive and former XFL president Jeff Pollack to help with operations. Pollack says the costs associated with the league are ""not significant"" so far.""That means we're going to have an opportunity to grow this business and do it in a way where the economics, in the beginning, are pretty favorable,"" Pollack said.McGrady wants to attract a mass Generation Z audience, meaning those born after 1997. Then, he believes, media and sponsorship fees will follow. While OBL is new to the minor league sports scene, he pointed to other amateur leagues such as cornhole and bowling that draws a niche audience on networks and believe OBL can do the same. ""No disrespect to what these other things ESPN is putting on their programming – this is more entertaining,"" McGrady told CNBC earlier this week at the Standard Hotel in Manhattan. OBL has already found a prominent media supporter. It struck a digital distribution deal with Paramount-owned Showtime network that allows the network to show OBL content on its YouTube channel as well as cross-promotion.Terms of this pact were undisclosed, but OBL confirmed it would split advertisement revenue. Drafted in 1997 by the Toronto Raptors, McGrady played 16 seasons in the NBA, including a long stretch with the Houston Rockets, and made over $160 million in earnings, according to Spotrac, a website that tracks sports contracts. McGrady's earnings include a $92 million deal with the Orlando Magic in 2000. His last NBA season was 2011-12.He compared OBL to his stint with the Magic. It only lasted four seasons, but it was the start of seven-straight All-Star appearances and McGrady's transition to ""a household name"" in the NBA.""I finally get the keys handed to me and blossomed into this [All-Star] player,"" said McGrady. ""I didn't see me being that type of guy. And I didn't see [OBL] being this.""OBL launched in February. The league plays regional games featuring 32 players throughout seven cities, including New York and Los Angeles. Players that win regional games earn $10,000. The top three players from the games can compete for the bigger $250,000 payout. McGrady praised his two teenage sons for sparking his interest in one-on-one basketball. They don't really watch live NBA or NCAA games, he said. ""What they will watch: YouTube, short-form content, highlights,"" McGrady added.McGrady isn't naïve about the start-up. He expects OBL will have hiccups, and profitability will be unlikely at first. McGrady and Pollack didn't discuss specifics around OBL's plan to make money, but they expect to eventually profit from licensing deals, sponsorships and ticketing, which would help create a return on investment for potential sponsors.""It'll come from the audience we ultimately reach and engage,"" Pollack said. ""We have a long way to go.""He added that OBL would eventually seek investors, but at this stage, ""we want to make sure that we understand clearly what this should be, and then we'll plan how to grow it.""OBL is joining a crowded sports media landscape. Competitors include the Drake- and Jeff Bezos-backed media company Overtime. This media firm operates Overtime Elite, or OTE – the league that pays high schoolers $100,000 with an established Gen Z following.Macroeconomic concerns, including inflation, threaten early growth. Asked about these factors, Pollack suggested OBL is playing the long game.""We're in a tough economic time, and it may get worse,"" Pollack said. ""But we're going to come out of it at some point, and what we've all seen in the last couple of years is the consumer appetite for sports content is as insatiable as it's ever been.""Should OBL attract its target audience to watch social media sports content, McGrady plans to grow the company globally.""I have the right team to make it happen,"" he said. ""I think we've identified a model where it's very entertaining."""

2022-05-29,"In May, the collapse of one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin projects cost investors tens of billions of dollars as they pulled out in a panic that some have compared to a bank run.A stablecoin known as terraUSD and its sister token luna experienced a pretty spectacular run-up before it all collapsed. Venture capital firm Pantera Capital tells CNBC their $1.7 million investment in luna turned into $170 million, while Hack VC and CMCC Global exited their luna position in December and March, respectively.  WASHINGTON — In May, the collapse of one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin projects cost investors tens of billions of dollars as they pulled out in a panic that some have compared to a bank run. But before that, the stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token luna, had experienced a pretty spectacular run-up — and some investors made a killing before it all collapsed.Venture capital firm Pantera Capital tells CNBC it earned a 100-fold return on its $1.7 million investment in luna. Hack VC and the Winklevoss-backed CMCC Global didn't share their exact gains, but CMCC told CNBC that it closed its luna position in March, while Hack reportedly got out in December.The scheme relied largely on faith and the promise of future returns, plus a complex set of code, with very little hard cash to back up the whole arrangement.Unlike USDC (another popular dollar-pegged stablecoin), which has fiat assets in reserve as a way to back their tokens, UST was an algorithmic stablecoin created and administered by Singapore-based Terraform Labs. It depended on computer code to self-stabilize its value by creating and destroying UST and luna in a sort of supply-and-demand seesaw effect.For a while, it worked.UST held its dollar peg and the luna token soared. The luna token rose to more than $116 in April, up more than 135% in less than two months. Traders were able to arbitrage the system and profit from deviations in the price of the two tokens. But perhaps the greatest incentive of the entire scheme was an accompanying lending platform, called Anchor, which promised investors a 20% annual percentage yield on their UST holdings — a rate many analysts said was unsustainable.Widespread buy-in — and public PSAs — from respected financial institutions lent credibility to the project, further driving the narrative that the whole thing was legit.Most everyone was happy until it all came crashing down in early May. Although the project had amassed about $3 billion worth of bitcoin in its reserves as a backstop for UST, when the price of luna became unstable, investors rushed out of both tokens, sending prices off a cliff. The Luna Foundation Guard tried to restore UST's $1 peg by spending almost all of the bitcoin in its reserve. It didn't work.At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless.The entire episode has laid bare the advantages of experienced large-scale investors over retail investors gambling on hope.One person posted on Reddit that they didn't think they would have enough money to pay for their next semester at school after losing money on luna and UST. Another investor affected by the crash tweeted that she and her husband sold their house and bet it all on luna, noting that she was still trying to digest whether it was actually happening or just a nightmare.Others are contemplating suicide after losing all they've got.""I'm lost, about to commit suicide in a chair,"" one commenter posted to Reddit. ""I lost my life savings in the investments of (LUNA UST) the worst thing is that 3 weeks ago I proposed to my girlfriend. She doesn't know anything, I lost 62 thousand dollars. I'm here I don't know what to do."" Among the winners of the UST flash crash are Pantera Capital, a hedge fund that saw a 100x return on its investment.Joey Krug, the fund's co-chief investment officer, told CNBC that in the primary fund where they held and traded luna, they sold about 87% of their position from Jan. 2021 through Apr. 2022. Pantera then sold another 8% in May once it was clear the UST peg had broken. At the end of it all, Krug says that Pantera ""got stuck"" with about 5% of their position.All that liquidation translated to a return of $171 million on a $1.7 million initial investment, assuming the remaining luna they own continue to be worth nothing.Even as the fund was selling, Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead joined CNBC in Dec. 2021 to talk about his top altcoin picks, which included the Terra blockchain's luna token. At the time, luna was up more than 15,800% in 2021.""We think it's one of the most promising coins for the coming year,"" Morehead said of luna. ""So many people are just discovering it and just starting to trade it.""But Krug says the firm's initial decision to liquidate came down to risk management and rebalancing the fund.""For the large portion which we sold over 2021 and part of 2022, it was a really simple risk management reason,"" said Krug. ""It kept becoming a larger and larger part of the fund and so we had to de-risk it since you can't really run a liquid hedge fund with one position being a super large portion of the fund.""When Pantera noticed the UST $1 peg breaking in May, it sold again.""It was really just seeing the peg break by a few cents and pattern matching it to historical currency pegs,"" continued Krug, who noted that generally when a currency breaks peg, it gets hammered. Even though the firm owned a bunch of luna as opposed to UST, when UST trades under its peg, the dynamic is such that more luna is minted, lowering the value of each coin overall.""So basically, you want to sell it so you don't end up getting diluted,"" explained Krug.Hong Kong-based venture firm CMCC Global was one of Terraform's first seed investors back in early 2018.CMCC Founder Martin Baumann tells CNBC it divested its stake in March because of concerns resulting from ongoing due diligence. The decision to sell was partly to do with the tech behind UST, but his chief concern had more to do with regulation.""As opposed to asset backed stablecoins, which are derivatives of existing USD in circulation, UST was effectively increasing the money supply of USD in existence,"" a job that Baumann notes is reserved for the Federal Reserve.""We figured, while an interesting concept, regulators would not tolerate tampering with money supply of the USD,"" continued Baumann.The rapid growth of UST accelerated CMCC's concerns.When CMCC sold, the luna token was trading at about $100. When asked about the profit on that sale, Baumann said the firm does not comment on returns or performance of individual investments.Crypto-centric venture fund Hack VC reportedly exited its Luna stake in December.CNBC reached out to Hack VC partner Rodney Yesep, but he didn't respond to our request for comment on the profitability of that sale. Yesep did say in a recent interview on the DeFi Decoded Podcast that they were seed investors in Terra from ""back in the day"" when it was ""like a different entity.""""It sucks to see a bunch of people get impacted by this sort of stuff,"" Yesep said in the podcast. ""We were no longer holding a position by the time the downturn happened, but a lot of people were, and a lot of people were pretty impacted.""Then there's Galaxy Digital, the crypto merchant bank founded by billionaire investor Mike Novogratz.In a public letter addressed to ""shareholders, friends, partners, and the crypto community,"" Novogratz — who got a luna tattoo on his arm to memorialize his status as an official 'Lunatic' — opined on where the project went wrong, but also noted that Galaxy took profits along the way.In its Q1 earnings filing, Galaxy noted that the largest contributor to its net realized gain on digital assets of $355 million was sales of luna.Other major backers of Terraform Labs included some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coinbase Ventures. Three Arrows Capital and Jump Crypto bought into the luna token. CNBC has not learned how these firms fared. Terra's backers have voted to revive the failed venture. The proposed re-build involves a new Terra blockchain and getting rid of the beleaguered stablecoin that helped trigger the meltdown of the original project. It could also mean redemption for the institutional and retail investors who got wiped out.For those who saw a big loss, the re-launch could potentially translate into an opportunity to recoup losses on initial investments.Delphi Digital, for example, has disclosed that it it is ""currently sitting on a large unrealized loss"" after miscalculating the risk of a death spiral event coming to fruition, and Coindesk reporting shows that Seoul-based Hashed Ventures has lost over $3.5 billion.The terra 2.0 proposal includes a plan to distribute tokens to holders of the old luna (soon to be renamed ""luna classic"") and UST tokens. If the rebranded coins take off, that could be a form of redemption for investors who suffered a loss.But for those who got out before things went south for UST, they are steering clear.""With the new chain, it looks like a good chunk of the airdropped tokens will be vested over a number of years,"" Pantera Capital's Krug told CNBC. ""We have projects in our portfolio which have integrations with Terra. I'd love to see something community driven succeed here, but we're a fairly chain-agnostic fund.""CMCC Global's Baumann said the fund has decided not to make new investments into the revived terra ecosystem at this time.Days before the UST collapse, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon — who has bragged that he doesn't ""debate the poor"" — said in an interview that 95% of coins would ""die"" but there is ""entertainment in watching companies die, too."""
2022-05-29,"DAVOS, SWITZERLAND – A hedge fund investor told me she attends the World Economic Forum each year ""so that I'll know what to short."" In a world awash with geopolitical and economic pessimism, the dominant mood at this year's Davos, her argument is that it might be time to go ""long"" on optimism.One can quibble with her premise that Davos is a place more for conventional wisdom than investable solutions. As the world's leading convener of global and business elites for most of the past half-century, the WEF often has been ahead in identifying trends, including the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and in generating positive change, such as CEOs' increased focus on social responsibility.That said, there's no doubt this year's prevailing theme was a collective gloom without ready solutions. One of Europe's most murderous conflicts since World War II grinds on without resolution; the global economy grinds toward recession with slowing growth and growing inflation; and COVID with all its variants persists into its third year, with a particular pounding of China and related supply chains.Yet there was another narrative on display in Davos as well.Russian President Vladimir Putin has jolted the collective West from its slumber. Europe has responded with more collective purpose, and its taxpayers are funding weapons for a Ukraine fighting for shared freedoms. Even Davos' newest elites, the cryptocurrency crowd, are exploring ways to deploy aid more effectively and swiftly to Ukraine even as they lick their wounds from billions in losses from the Terra crypto scandal.That Davos for the first time took Russians off its invite list underscored that there are some crimes the global community must oppose.""In Davos, our solidarity is foremost with the people suffering from the atrocities of this war,"" said Klaus Schwab, the Forum's founder and executive chairman. The WEF called for a ""Marshall Plan"" for the reconstruction of Ukraine, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the Davos crowd via video that it should use seized Russian assets to help accomplish that task.Not present was China's President Xi Jinping, who has used the Davos stage to preen as a champion for a better world, most recently on Jan. 17 when he spoke to a virtual WEF session.""We need to discard Cold War mentality and seek peaceful coexistence and win-win outcomes,"" he said, just a matter of days before he signed a joint statement with Putin agreeing to a relationship ""without limits."" That, in turn, was a little more than a month before Putin launched his war.One wonders whether Xi ever tried to convince Putin of what he told his January Davos audience: ""History has proved time and again that confrontation does not solve problems, it only invites catastrophic consequences.""The week's most repeated story was that of how Ukrainian business leader and philanthropist Victor Pinchuk transformed the perennial ""Russia House"" into ""Russian War Crimes House.""Prominently located on the ski resort's main drag, Russian business and government leaders took meetings and downed vodka shots there in previous years. This year its walls wore photographs and a big screen showing Putin's atrocities.""Russia for years came here to Davos to present itself in the way it believed it should show itself to the world,"" exhibition curator Bjorn Geldhof, told CNBC's Silvia Amaro. ""We are representing war crimes that Russia is committing in Ukraine, but war crimes that were also committed in Chechnya, that were committed in Syria — so what we are showing is the reality from Russia that most people don't speak about.""For all these reasons and more, I am going ""short"" on pessimism and long on ""optimism"" as I return to Washington, D.C., this weekend. I'm acting less due to any conviction about a positive outcome than I am because of the costs to us all if we don't leverage this moment for a common cause.I'm wagering that the hope and heroism Ukrainians have demonstrated will overwhelm the complacency that has weakened global democracies for much of the past three decades. I'm betting that the resolve to help the Ukrainians win will expand and outlast signs of fatigue as Russia makes gains in eastern Ukraine.As Delaware Senator Christopher Coons told the Washington Post's Ishaan Tharoor in Davos: ""I think it's fairly obvious that the Russian plan is to grind it out … and to count on the West to come apart in some way and frankly to lose interest and be distracted by high energy costs and our own elections.""I'm also wishing, against previous experience, that following this week's school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, resulting in 21 deaths, the United States can address its domestic ills even as it rallies the world to help Ukraine defeat Putin. One draws hope from the new $40 billion aid package for Ukraine that Washington's toxic partisanship isn't irreparable.One can only see hope in Sweden and Finland's applications to join NATO, ending a 200-year history of Swedish neutrality, not to threaten Putin but rather to better unify the transatlantic community against a generational threat. I'm betting that NATO can overcome Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's objections.President Joe Biden's trip this week to Asia was also encouraging, in that it introduced a new economic plan to advance relations with his partners and abandoned the outdated concept of ""strategic ambiguity"" toward Taiwan, not to make war but to prevent it.It was Secretary of State Antony Blinken's speech at George Washington University on Thursday that captured the link between Putin's war and China's challenge.""Beijing's defense of President Putin's war to erase Ukraine's sovereignty and secure its sphere of influence in Europe should raise alarm bells for all of us who call the Indo-Pacific region home,"" he said, later adding, ""We cannot rely on Beijing to change its trajectory. So we will shape the strategic environment around Beijing to advance our vision for an open, inclusive international system.""That's an outcome worth investing in.— Frederick Kempe is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Atlantic Council."
2022-05-29,"Covid closed schools and offices and supercharged demand for cloud services. But now that's mostly over, and cloud stocks have been coming down.Higher interest rates have especially challenged money-losing cloud stocks. Now investors are paying more attention to profit margins and free cash flow than before, even for the fastest-growing cloud stocks. Tech investors finally got some relief this past week, as the Nasdaq broke a seven-week losing streak, its worst stretch since the dot-com bust of 2001.With five months in the books, 2022 has been a dark year for tech so far. Nobody knows that more than investors in cloud computing companies, which were among the darlings of the past five years, particularly during the stay-home days of the pandemic.related investing newsHere’s the secret sauce that fueled Palo Alto Networks’ beat and raise despite tough timesJeff Marks5 hours agoA.I. investments will keep Nvidia ahead of its semiconductor rivals, Stifel saysBrian Evans20 hours agoParadoxically, growth remains robust and businesses are benefiting as economies re-open, but investors are selling anyway.Bill.com, Blend Labs and SentinelOne are all still doubling their revenue year over year, at 179%, 124% and 120%, respectively. Yet the trio is worth around half of what they were at the end of 2021. The market has taken a sledgehammer to the entire basket.Byron Deeter of Bessemer Venture Partners, an investor in cloud start-ups and one of the most vocal cloud-stock commentators observed earlier this month that the revenue multiples for the firm's BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index had fallen back to where they were in 2017. One of Deeter's colleagues at Bessemer, Kent Bennett, isn't sure why the fastest growers aren't getting a pass on the slashing across the cloud category. But he has an idea.""You can absolutely imagine in a moment like this it would go from revenue to, 'Holy crap, get me out of this market,' and then settle back into efficiency over time,"" said Bennett, who sits on the board of restaurant software company Toast, which itself showed 90% growth in the first quarter. The stock is now down 52% year to date.Toast disclosed declining revenue in 2020 as in-person restaurant visits lightened up, leading to less intense use of the company's point-of-sale hardware and software. Then online ordering took off. Now people are increasingly dining in again, and Toast is seeing stronger demand for its Go mobile point-of-sale devices and QR codes that let people order and pay on their own phones, CEO Chris Comparato said in an interview with CNBC earlier this month.Now that the company has recovered from its Covid stumble, investors are telling the company to ""paint a better path toward profitability,"" he said.Management is telling all teams to be very diligent about their unit economics, but Comparato said he's not ready to tell investors when exactly the company will break even, though.What Toast did offer up is new information on margins. On Toast's first-quarter earnings call earlier this month, finance chief Elena Gomez said guidance implies that its margin for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in the second half of 2022 will be 2 points higher compared with the first half as the company works to bolster margins in the future.""A few investors pushed, and they want a little bit more detail, certainly,"" Comparato said. ""But many of them are like, 'Okay, this was a different tone, Chris, thank you. Chris, and Elena, please keep executing on this on this vision.'""Other cloud companies are getting the message, too.Data-analytics software maker Snowflake, which just ended a two-and-a-half-year streak of triple-digit revenue growth, is ""not a growth-at-all-costs company,"" CEO Frank Slootman declared on a call with analysts on Wednesday.Zuora, which offers subscription-management software, is ""focused on building a successful long-term company, delivering durable and profitable growth for years to come,"" CEO Tien Tzuo said on his company's quarterly analyst call. The company reported a $23.2 million net loss on $93.2 million in revenue, compared with a $17.7 million loss in the year-ago quarter. Even across the wider software industry, there is a re-acknowledgment of the old-fashioned view that software should make money. Splunk, whose software helps corporate security teams amass and analyze data, included a slide in its shareholder presentation called ""Growing Profitability With Scale."" It charted the past few years of Splunk's performance against the ""Rule of 40,"" a concept stipulating that a company's revenue growth rate and profit margin should add up to 40%. Splunk called for 35%, the closest it will have been in three years, in the current fiscal year.The emphasis on efficiency isn't completely absent at Bill.com, whose software helps small and medium-sized businesses manage bills and invoices, but that's easier to miss, because the revenue is growing so much faster than it is at most businesses. Even before the software selloff began in November, executives have touted the company's healthy unit economics.Blend Labs, which gives banks software they can draw on for mortgage applications and other processes, has been more active in repositioning itself for the new market reality, but it's also one-seventeenth the size of Bill.com by market capitalization.Despite enjoying hypergrowth, Blend cut its headcount by 10% in April. Nima Ghamsari, the company's co-founder and head, told analysts the company was conducting a ""comprehensive review to align our cash consumption and market realities near-term, while charting a clear course toward stronger product and operating margins that will lead to Blend having long-term profitability.""SentinelOne, which sells cybersecurity software that detects and responds to threats, has been busy working on its cost structure. Co-Founder and CEO Tomer Weingarten turned analysts' attention to its margin improvement during a March conference call, and he said the company aims to make more progress over the next year.The comments, and the better-than-expected results in general, were well received by analysts. But many still lowered their price targets on SentinelOne stock anyway.""While we are increasing our growth estimates on S, we reduce our PT to $48/share due entirely to a reduction in software multiples,"" analysts at BTIG wrote to clients. In other words, the category was getting crushed, and SentinelOne was not exempt.By that point the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund, an exchange-traded fund tracking Bessemer's  index, had tumbled 47% from its Nov. 9 high. The decline hasn't stopped as the Federal Reserve has reiterated plans to fight inflation with higher interest rates.That leaves cloud observers wondering when the downward pressure will ease up.""It's going to take us a couple months to get through this, said Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr, a company that holds cloud-centric conferences. He likens the decline to a hangover, after Covid got investors drunk on cloud stocks. ""We haven't got through our Bloody Marys and Aspirins,"" he said.Two of the biggest divas in the Covid cloud set, Shopify and Zoom Video Communications, saw the triple-digit growth go away last year as stores began to reopen and in-person social engagements began to return. If anything, that's when investors should have grasped that the demand boom was largely in the past, Lemkin said.""We're reverting to the mean,"" he said.The reset might not be uniform, though. Cloud companies that adhere to the Rule of 40 are showing considerably healthier revenue multiples than those that don't, said Mary D'Onofrio, another investor at Bessemer. Companies showing free cash flow margins above 10% are also enjoying higher multiples better these days, she said, with investors fearing a recession.""The market has rotated to where cash is king,"" D'Onofrio said.-- CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.WATCH: Tech will see cutbacks in marketing budgets, slower recruiting and layoffs, says Bessemer's Deeter"
2022-05-30,"Terra has launched a new version of its failed luna cryptocurrency, which plunged to $0 this month.At its height, the old luna — now known as ""luna classic"" — had a circulating supply of over $40 billion.The revived luna token is already trading on exchanges. But its price is crashing. A new version of the collapsed luna cryptocurrency is already live on major exchanges — and it's gotten off to a bad start.Last week, supporters of the Terra blockchain project voted to revive luna but not terraUSD, a so-called ""stablecoin"" that plunged below its intended peg to the dollar, causing panic in the crypto market.TerraUSD, or UST, is what's known as an algorithmic stablecoin. It relied on code and a sister token, luna, to maintain a $1 value. But as digital currency prices fell, investors fled the stablecoin, sending UST tumbling — and taking luna down with it.At its height, the old luna — now known as ""luna classic"" — had a circulating supply of over $40 billion.Now, luna has a new iteration, which investors are calling Terra 2.0. It is already trading on exchanges including Bybit, Kucoin and Huobi. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, says it will list luna on Tuesday.Its launch has not gone well.After reaching a peak of $19.53 on Saturday, luna dropped as low as $4.39 just hours later, according to CoinMarketCap data. It has since settled at a price of around $5.90.Analysts are deeply skeptical about the chances of Terra's revived blockchain being a success. It will have to compete with a host of other so-called ""Layer 1"" networks — the infrastructure that underpins cryptocurrencies like ethereum, solana and cardano. Terra is distributing luna tokens through what's called an ""airdrop."" Most will go to those who held luna classic and UST before their collapse, in an effort to compensate investors.But many investors burned by the debacle are unlikely to trust Terra a second time, experts say. Vijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, said there's been a ""massive loss in confidence"" in the project."
2022-05-30,"South Korea's investment of around $177.1 million is among the first investments in the nascent industry to be made by a national government and is a cautious first step into the metaverse.It signals an interest in a technology that could take center stage in the coming years — and it could provide a blueprint for others to follow.But there are many issues that South Korea and other governments will have to address when venturing into the metaverse, whether it's using the technology to improve citizen engagement, or in deciding the role they will play as regulators of a rapidly expanding technology. The shape that the metaverse will take is still unknown, but South Korea is betting on the fledgling industry as the next big thing.As part of its Digital New Deal, a program for investing in new technologies in the country's economy, the Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technologies plans to kickstart the metaverse industry in South Korea by supporting companies and creating jobs.Minister of Science and ICT Lim Hyesook called the metaverse ""an uncharted digital continent with indefinite potential,"" with the government earmarking 223.7 billion won ($177.1 million) for the endeavor.On the city level, Seoul's metropolitan government is building a 3.9 billion-won metaverse platform to allow citizens to access public services virtually.The metaverse, which has drawn hype in the last year, refers to technologies like virtual reality and the idea that people may be playing and living in virtual worlds. It has been touted as the next frontier in technology services, especially since Facebook rebranded itself as Meta and committed to developing a metaverse-focused future.That all fits into the concept of Web3, a broad church encompassing the metaverse, virtual reality, augmented reality and blockchain technology, as well as digital assets like cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). South Korea's investment of around $177.1 million is among the first investments in the nascent industry to be made by a national government and is a cautious first step into the metaverse.It signals an interest in a technology that could take center stage in the coming years — and it could provide a blueprint for others to follow. ""It's interesting, it's predominantly a private sector and Big Tech-driven initiative and trend. Governments have not done much beyond South Korea,"" Yugal Joshi, a partner at research firm Everest Group, told CNBC.Other government bodies in Asia are taking notice, too. Shanghai's authorities have been encouraging public services to be built with the metaverse in mind, as previously reported by CNBC.""Some things are happening in bits and pieces but I believe this does tell you that governments are starting to take this more seriously because it's a platform where people come together. Anything which makes people come together, it makes governments interested.""Joshi said that in China, tech giants like Tencent and Alibaba have shown a keen eye for developing metaverse products, with the latter recently investing in an AR glasses start-up.He added that metaverse activity in Asia, much like the rest of the world, is still in its infancy, as companies invest time and money in finding the first major winning application.Despite the growing interest and South Korea's plans, no country has emerged with a clear first mover advantage, he said.""How governments will use it is still undecided because the entire ecosystem is still undecided. It is still being built."" How metaverse technologies will gel with existing regulations is therefore among many questions that governments and policymakers will have to grapple with in the coming years.For example, NFTs, a critical component of many metaverse developments, remain in a legal gray area in South Korea and are not subject to the same rules as cryptocurrencies.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Science and ICT declined to comment beyond its public statements.But, for now, the adoption of NFTs or crypto in the country hasn't been curtailed, and big names are getting in on the trend.BTS, the record-breaking K-pop group, announced an NFT project late last year. Despite some backlash from fans over environmental concerns — NFTs and cryptocurrencies require a lot of computing power — the project is moving ahead. Meanwhile, LG Electronics, the Korean tech giant, launched a blockchain and cryptocurrency division earlier this year. Javier Floren, CEO of NFT start-up DNAverse, said countries that experiment with these new technologies will gain a greater understanding of them for the future.However, that experimentation comes with several risks. Cryptocurrencies, another large component of Web3 and metaverse developments, are notoriously volatile, as seen in May's price crash.For a country like El Salvador, which has made bitcoin legal tender, being at the vanguard of new tech also means being vulnerable to such risks.""It's going to depend on how different countries approach the legal side,"" Floren said.""With any new technology or disruptive ecosystem and new places to interact, there will be issues, challenges and for sure dangers."" Governments will need to ""change a little bit of their mindset,"" he said, to make sense of both the opportunities and the risks, such as the protection of user's privacy or the threat of scams.""At the beginning there won't be legal support or coverage by official institutions so the governments have to understand how Web3 is moving because the [existing] protocols are not going to work in Web3,"" Floren added. Meta envisions a metaverse in which people socialize in digital worlds through avatars. But a novel digital experience brings with it old problems, too. Questions of privacy, security, safety and illegal activity will be challenges for such platforms and the authorities that oversee them.Those are among the myriad issues that South Korea and other governments will have to address when venturing into the metaverse, whether it's using the technology to improve citizen engagement, or in deciding the role they will play as regulators of a rapidly expanding technology.In light of this, South Korea plans to create a body that brings together different ministries to monitor issues like data protection, illegal behavior and intellectual property protection. But collaboration across different authorities may be necessary if the metaverse becomes as ubiquitous as its proponents hope. The Institute of Engineering and Technology, a U.K.-based organization, published a report in April which outlined its concerns around abusive or illegal content in the metaverse. Children are at risk, it said, citing a survey that found two-thirds of parents don't understand how the metaverse works or what content their children are accessing.""Nobody is thinking about it meaningfully, which is unfortunate because it's actually very important but that has happened in social media as well,"" Joshi said.He added that there are a lot of companies jumping on the metaverse ""bandwagon"" without examining these particular risks.""I haven't come across many areas where vendors are building these platforms or even enterprises that are really thinking about these things."""

Abramovich put the Chelsea team up for sale on March 2, a week after the invasion and a few days before the British government added his name to a list of sanctioned Russian oligarchs.

Ukraine's hip-hop and folk band Kalush Orchestra won in a landslide with their song Stefania, a powerful ode to Ukraine's mothers.— Natasha Turak  Mon, May 30 20223:12 AM EDT The EU will continue to work Monday toward an agreement to embargo Russian oil, after attempts to do so on Sunday failed.The talks are largely held up by Hungary, a major user of Russian oil and whose leader Viktor Orban is on friendly terms with Russia's Vladimir Putin.Budapest over the weekend signaled support for a European Commission proposal that would apply sanctions only on Russian oil brought into the EU by tankers, which would allow landlocked energy importers Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to continue to receive their Russian oil via pipeline until alternative sources can be found. Talks were held up however by demands from Hungary for EU financing.The proposed sanctions on oil imports would be part of the EU's sixth sanctions package on Russia since it invaded Ukraine in late February.Roughly 36% of the EU's oil imports come from Russia. Energy prices, already high at the start of this year, have skyrocketed since Putin launched the war against Ukraine.— Natasha Turak  Mon, May 30 20222:45 AM EDT The Russian army has likely suffered ""devastating losses"" among its mid and junior ranking officials, which will likely exacerbate problems in modernizing its approach to command and control, the U.K. defense ministry said.  Junior officers are leading lowest level tactical actions because the army lacks highly trained and empowered non-commissioned officers who fulfil that role in Western forces, the ministry said in an intelligence update.""More immediately, battalion tactical groups (BTGs) which are being reconstituted in Ukraine from survivors of multiple units are likely to be less effective due to a lack of junior leaders,"" the ministry added.""Brigade and battalion commanders likely deploy forwards into harm's way because they are held to an uncompromising level of responsibility for their units' performance,"" the ministry said.The lack of experienced and credible commanders is also likely to result in a further drop in morale and continued poor discipline following multiple credible reports of localized mutinies amongst Russian forces, the ministry added.— Chelsea Ong  Mon, May 30 20222:54 AM EDT The world, particularly the West, should have been more alert to Putin's actions in Georgia and Ukraine in previous years and should have more actively engaged with Russia then, says Angus Blair, professor at the American University in Cairo.   Sun, May 29 20223:51 PM EDT The ""liberation"" of Ukraine's Donbas is an ""unconditional priority"" for Moscow, while other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own, RIA news agency cited Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Sunday.""The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognized by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,"" Lavrov said in an interview with French TV channel TF1, according to RIA.For the rest of the territories in Ukraine, ""the people should decide their future in these areas,"" he said.— Reuters  Sun, May 29 20223:45 PM EDT The European Union failed to reach an agreement on a Russian oil embargo, a senior EU official told Reuters.Diplomats will still try to make progress ahead of a Monday-Tuesday summit on an exemption for pipeline deliveries to landlocked Central European countries, officials told the news agency.The proposed sanctions, which would be the EU's sixth package in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, are facing oil supply concerns from countries including landlocked Hungary.Talks have been going on for a month, and would continue Monday, Reuters said.— Leslie Josephs  Mon, May 30 20222:29 AM EDT Zelenskyy visits frontlines; Lithuania raises money to buy combat drone for Ukraine "

Two top cryptocurrency companies, Ripple and FTX, told CNBC that they're on the lookout for acquisitions as the industry hopes to drive growth through buying other firms.It is a sign that some crypto firms feel that they're large enough and well capitalized to splash the cash on acquisitions.Brett Harrison, president of cryptocurrency exchange FTX U.S., said in an interview last week that the company is in ""a very good spot in terms of our capital and cash"" and will ""look around the market for potential merger and acquisition opportunities.""Harrison said that FTX U.S. will look for companies which will help them acquire more users or regulatory licenses. In 2020, FTX acquired trading platform Blockfolio which helped it get more users. Earlier this month, CNBC reported that FTX is looking for brokerage start-ups to acquire to push further into stock trading.Last year, FTX U.S. bought LedgerX, a futures exchange that had several licenses from regulators in the U.S.""We're doing that globally, in places like in Japan, Australia, in Dubai, different places where we've been able to either partner with local companies or sometimes do acquisitions to be able to get licenses that we need,"" Harrison said.Meanwhile, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of cross-border payments company Ripple, said the company has ""a very strong balance sheet,"" predicting a rise in mergers and acquisitions in the crypto industry.""I think there'll be an uptick in M&A in the blockchain and crypto space. We haven't seen that yet. But I think that's likely in the future. And I certainly think as that unfolds, we would consider things like that,"" Garlinghouse told CNBC in an interview last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.""We're now at a stage of growth where I think we're more likely to be the buyer versus the ... seller,"" he added. Mergers and acquisition activity in crypto boomed in 2021 with the global value of such transactions totaling more than $55 billion, versus $1.1 billion in 2020, according to PWC. That coincided with a boom in cryptocurrency prices that took bitcoin to an all-time high in November last year.But since then, prices have come crashing down. Bitcoin is about 55% off of its record high of $68,990.90, according to CoinDesk data.A drop in cryptocurrency prices, and potentially valuations of companies in the industry, could make certain acquisitions attractive to larger players.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook. "
2022-05-31,"The U.K. government has proposed amending existing rules to manage the failure of stablecoin firms that may pose a ""systemic"" risk.It comes after the collapse of terraUSD, a so-called stablecoin that was meant to always be worth $1.Regulators are worried about the risks posed by stablecoins to the broader financial system. Britain wants to make sure stablecoins don't end up threatening the wider financial system following the collapse of controversial crypto project Terra.The government on Tuesday proposed amending existing rules to manage the failure of stablecoin firms that may pose a ""systemic"" risk. The proposal is separate from previously announced plans to regulate stablecoins under laws governing electronic payments.""Since the initial commitment to regulate certain types of stablecoins, events in cryptoasset markets have further highlighted the need for appropriate regulation to help mitigate consumer, market integrity and financial stability risks,"" the government said in a consultation paper setting out its proposals.""The government considers that it is important to ensure existing legal frameworks can be effectively applied to manage the risks posed by the possible failure of systemic DSA [digital settlement asset] firms for the purposes of financial stability.""Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a traditional asset, most often the U.S. dollar. TerraUSD, a so-called ""algorithmic"" stablecoin, was meant to follow this arrangement using a mix of code and partial backing from bitcoin and other digital tokens. But it imploded earlier this month, taking an associated token called luna tumbling with it. Panic over the debacle has erased hundreds of billions of dollars from the entire crypto market.That has, in turn, caused concern for regulators, who are worried about the risks posed by stablecoins to the broader financial system. Tether, the world's biggest stablecoin, saw more than $10 billion in redemptions in the weeks following Terra's collapse, fueling fears of a 2008-style ""bank run"" with knock-on effects for other financial markets. Though Tether says its token is fully backed by assets held in a reserve, critics remain unconvinced and have called for a full audit.The government is looking to implement additional safeguards to existing legislation around insolvency of firms operating key financial market infrastructure. Such a provision would take into account the return or transfer of the private keys that protect users' funds. The Bank of England would serve as the lead regulator enforcing the rules. A consultation on the proposal is currently underway and will close on Aug. 2.Glen Goodman, a crypto advisor to eToro, said the proposal was ""pretty dramatic.""The government has ""effectively accepted that some stablecoins may become as systemically important as banks and so should be treated as special cases and assisted if they're failing,"" he said."
2022-05-31,"The world of freelancers continues to grow. As of 2021, there are more than 6 million independent professionals in the U.S., according to freelancer platform Fiverr's 2022 Freelance Economic Impact Report.Fiverr defines ""independent professionals"" as those who earn their income outside of traditional employment, who do not employ others and who offer creative services like video producing, technical services like IT, and professional services like accounting. They make up 3.9% of the U.S. labor force and earned an estimated $247 billion in revenue in 2021.While some of their skills are regularly in demand, the work their clients need can change over time. Fiverr analyzed data from its millions of searches across the platform for its Small Business Needs Index, to see which services have seen significant increases in the past six months, compared to the previous six months.Here are five of those ""trending skills,"" as Gali Arnon, Fiverr's chief marketing officer, calls them and how much freelancers are charging for them.  Businesses are always looking for the best ways to reach their client base across social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok. Video ads created specifically for these various platforms help them do that.The term saw a 453% growth in search over the last six months.Professionals who offer this service take on work like video editing, scriptwriting and voice overs. They charge anywhere from $5 to $1,200 per project. Similarly, businesses are constantly in need of social media mavens to create content for their Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube channels and more to ensure they're building relationships with their clients.Projects in this space are ""great opportunities for young people,"" says Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter, because ""they're jobs with no set education or experience requirements"" other than simply knowing how to use the platforms.Social media content manager saw a 361% growth in search in the last six months. These professionals charge anywhere from $5 to $2,100 for their packages on the site. A logistic website is one that helps businesses keep track of cargo and transportation to see when their product shipments may arrive, what their delivery costs could be and so on. With so many disruptions to the global supply chain over the last few years, businesses looking to build these sites may be hoping to get a better of sense how they can best deliver their products.  This term saw a 268% surge in searches, according to Fiverr.Freelancers offering to build logistic websites charge anywhere from $15 to $950 per project. Three-dimensional CAD, or computer-aided design, modeling is used to create digital renderings of a product before it's made. It helps companies get a sense of what their products could look like and how they could function before they invest in building them.Three-dimensional modeling is also used in industries like architecture, and Fiverr attributes the term's popularity, in part, to the growth in metaverse interest.Though 3D CAD modeling saw a 297% surge in searches in the last six months, the term, ""has been flourishing on Fiverr in the last few years,"" says Arnon, adding that, ""everything from 3D modeling to 3D CAD modeling and all those new technologies are great opportunities for architects, designers, 3D designers.""Freelancers who offer the service charge between $5 and $1,500 per project.

Sponsorships include deals for arena-naming rights and for companies to put their names or logos on players' jerseys. Crypto partnerships are now the second most lucrative sponsorship category for the NBA, behind only the technology category.  Cryptocurrency companies helped fuel the NBA's sponsorship revenue to a record $1.6 billion in the 2021-22 season, according to estimates by IEG, a sports partnerships consultancy.That's up 13% from the $1.4 billion in the 2020-21 season. In the 2018-19 season, the National Basketball Association raked in $1.2 billion in sponsorship money. Sponsorship agreements can include deals for arena-naming rights and for companies to put their names or logos on players' jerseys.""The cryptocurrency category's sponsorship sending spree is like nothing we have ever seen before,"" said said Peter Laatz, IEG's global managing director.Crypto partnerships are now the second most lucrative sponsorship category for the NBA, behind only the technology category. Among the NBA's crypto deals this season was a league agreement with crypto trading platform Coinbase. CNBC reported that the deal is worth $192 million over four years.Other categories estimated to pay the NBA over $100 million annually include banks, telecom and merchandise, according to IEG. Companies spending at least $50 million include Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi, and AT&T.Among the big four sports leagues, the NBA ranks third in sponsorship revenue. The NFL is No. 1 with nearly $2 billion in sponsorship deals for its 2021 season, according to IEG. And in March, CNBC reported MLB made $1.7 billion in sponsorships last season. The NHL secured $676 million in sponsorship money for the 2020-21 season.IEG's projections come as the NBA Finals are set to begin on Thursday, when the Golden State Warriors will host the Boston Celtics in Game 1 at Chase Center.On the team front, the Los Angeles Lakers agreed to a 20-year arena-naming rights contract worth $700 million with platform Crypto.com. And the Warriors signed a $10 million global rights agreement with FTX, a crypto derivatives exchange. The company also secured arena naming rights for the Miami Heat. Another category helping the NBA's bottom line: ads on players' jerseys.The NBA is expected to bring in more than $200 million this season from jersey patch deals. They include the Brooklyn Nets securing $30 million a season from brokerage trading platform Webull in September 2021. The deal led the NBA at the time, but the Warriors overtook the top spot earlier this month when it renewed its deal with Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten.The terms of that deal weren't publicly disclosed. But league sources told CNBC Rakuten will pay the Warriors north of $40 million annually. That's up from $20 million for the previous deal.The people spoke to CNBC on the condition of remaining anonymous because they're restricted from publicly discussing team agreements.Jersey sponsorships have expanded in pro leagues over the last year. The NHL, for example, added patches on uniforms and helmets during the pandemic. And the MLB approved team uniform patches in its new labor agreement with players in March of this year. The NFL doesn't allow patches on uniforms.Growing revenue from ads on uniforms and other sponsorship deals could help the NBA reach its projected $10 billion in total revenue this season. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said total revenue in the 2020-21 season was down about 35% from the previous year after the pandemic trimmed the season to just 72 games. Revenue in the 2019-20 season, which was also partially impacted by the pandemic, was $8.3 billion, down from $8.8 billion in 2018-19.But the NBA's revenue is poised to keep growing.The league's data rights deal with Switzerland-based Sportradar — reportedly worth $1 billion — starts in the 2023-24 season. The NBA's TV deal also expires after the 2024-25 season and sports executives expect that'll eclipse its current $24 billion value, or roughly $2 billion per season. The NBA also has a merchandise deal with e-commerce powerhouse Fanatics and a deal with Dapper Labs, the creator of NBA Top Shot NFTs.In league deals, companies also commit to buying advertisements for national NBA games.For 2021-22 regular-season games, national ad spend on NBA games reached $470.7 million, according to media tracking company iSpot.  "

Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is launching its own venture capital fund.The company's venture arm, Binance Labs, said Wednesday it has raised $500 million for its debut start-up fund, securing backing from partners at DST Global and Breyer Capital as well as unnamed family offices and corporations.

Though still an ill-defined term, Web3 loosely refers to a hypothetical future iteration of the internet that's more decentralized than online platforms today and incorporates blockchain, the shared digital ledgers behind most major cryptocurrencies.The launch of Binance's new fund arrives at a time when bitcoin and other digital currencies are down sharply. Bitcoin has plunged more than 50% since reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November. That's taken a toll on publicly-listed crypto companies like Coinbase, whose shares have plunged 69% since the start of 2022. Investors fear the slump will feed through to privately-held crypto start-ups. While start-up valuations of $1 billion or more are ""slowing down a bit,"" there's ""no current impact in early-stage private markets,"" Ken Li, Binance Labs' executive director of investments and M&A, told CNBC.Binance Labs is hoping to capitalize on the recent plunge in digital assets to find founders building what it sees as the next big thing in tech. Its bets will be split into pre-seed, early-stage and growth equity, and the fund will invest in tokens as well as shares.""We are looking for projects with the potential to drive the growth of the Web3 ecosystem,"" Li said. Such projects may include infrastructure, nonfungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations. Binance estimates there are currently around 300,000 to 500,000 active Web3 developers, a number it hopes to grow ""substantially.""Binance has made a series of high-profile equity investments in the past year.

It was also an investor in Terraform Labs, the embattled Singapore-based start-up behind failed stablecoin project Terra.

2022-06-01,"U.S. prosecutors in New York's Southern District have charged and arrested Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at the online marketplace OpenSea. The 31-year-old faces one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading in non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, ""using confidential information about what NFTs were going to be featured on OpenSea's homepage for his personal financial gain.""Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, the Department of Justice wrote in a press release.  U.S. prosecutors are now going after insider trading in the crypto industry.On Wednesday, prosecutors in New York's Southern District charged and arrested Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at the online marketplace OpenSea. The 31-year-old faces one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading in non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, ""using confidential information about what NFTs were going to be featured on OpenSea's homepage for his personal financial gain.""Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, the Department of Justice wrote in a press release. DOJ officials say it is the first time they have pursued an insider trading charge involving digital assets.Chastain's alleged scheme was relatively simple.According to the indictment, Chastain was tasked with selecting NFTs to be featured on OpenSea's homepage. OpenSea kept those homepage selections confidential until they went live, since a main page listing often translated to a jump in price for both the featured NFT, as well as NFTs made by the same creator.From roughly June to September of 2021, the indictment says, Chastain would secretly buy an NFT just before OpenSea featured the piece on the front page of its website. Once those NFTs hit the main page, he would allegedly sell them ""at profits of two- to five-times his initial purchase price.""To cover his tracks, he conducted transactions with anonymous digital currency wallets and anonymous accounts on OpenSea, according to the DOJ, which alleges this happened dozens of times.""NFTs might be new, but this type of criminal scheme is not,"" said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. ""Today's charges demonstrate the commitment of this Office to stamping out insider trading — whether it occurs on the stock market or the blockchain.""The FBI's Assistant Director-in-Charge Michael J. Driscoll says the bureau will continue to aggressively pursue actors who choose to manipulate the market in this way.Up until Sept. 2021, when Chastain's alleged bad practices first came to light, the start-up was relatively lax with respect to restrictions around employees using privileged information to invest in NFTs.The company has since implemented two new employee policies, including banning OpenSea team members from buying or selling from collections or creators while they are being featured or promoted by the company, as well as barring staff from ""using confidential information to purchase or sell any NFTs, whether available on the OpenSea platform or not."" The entire episode lays bare the regulatory gap that exists across large swaths of the wider crypto ecosystem. NFTs, in particular, exist in a legal gray zone. They aren't officially considered securities, nor is there much by way of legal precedent around digital assets as a whole. So up until today's arrest, it wasn't clear if prosecutors would go after insider trading of NFTs.London-based fintech data analyst Boaz Sobrado said the OpenSea scandal makes two things clear. First, the transparency of the blockchain makes it a powerful tool to monitor nefarious behavior, given that all trades are public and recorded forever. But until today's arrest, regulators hadn't done much with that information.""There's a lot of chat about regulation right now, but what a lot of these bad actors are doing is clearly against the law right now. Regulators don't need their powers expanded to be able to combat this sort of fraud and misleading statements,"" Sobrado said.Sobrado noted that money is so loose in the space that people participating in nefarious activity are neglecting the simplest steps to cover their tracks.""This, again, is indicative of the sort of wanton craziness that is going on in the sector right now,"" he said. ""While the going is good and everyone feels like they're rich, it's not spoken about as much. But as soon as the market turns down, a lot of these people are going to get exposed and a lot of people are going to be angry."""

Fellow crypto exchange Coinbase recently reported that revenue had fallen 27% from a year ago, as had overall usage.It's been a brutal few weeks for the crypto market. Half a trillion dollars was wiped off the sector's market cap as terraUSD, one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, imploded virtually overnight. It is unclear whether this recent rout marks the next crypto winter (a multiyear bear market that occurs on a cyclical basis for the crypto asset class), though dropping trading volumes on crypto exchanges is one sign that we may be headed in that direction. The last so-called crypto winter ran from 2018 into the fall of 2020 as the value of cryptocurrencies plunged and layoffs were rife.Gemini — which has been around since 2014 and is valued at $7.1 billion as of its last funding round — has 1,033 people on its payroll, according to PitchBook, which translates to about 100 employees affected by today's layoffs. CNBC reached out to Gemini to ask for the exact figure, but the press team declined to comment beyond the blog post.As for next steps, Gemini has closed its physical offices today in order to protect employee privacy. Impacted team members will receive a calendar invite for individual conversations about separation packages and health care benefits. On Friday, remaining employees will take part in a ""company-wide standup"" to talk about its future.The memo says that Gemini wants to focus only on products that are critical to its mission — and team leaders will assess whether their teams are ""right-sized"" for the ""current, turbulent market conditions that are likely to persist for some time.""""Today is a tough day, but one that will make Gemini better over the long run,"" the brothers wrote in the staffwide memo.Other fintech start-ups such as Robinhood and BitMEX have recently cut staff.But even as crypto companies pare back their rosters, venture capitalists continue to pour money into the crypto ecosystem.

""The extended hiring pause will include backfills, except for roles that are necessary to meet the high standards we set for security and compliance, or to support other mission-critical work."" Coinbase has lost more than 70% of its value this year as the selloff in cryptocurrencies coupled with economic turmoil has spurred a decline in users and shrinking revenue. The pain is being felt across much of the tech sector, with Uber and Facebook parent Meta taking similar steps, and Robinhood cutting headcount by about 9%.Prior to the 2022 downturn, Coinbase had been among the highest flyers in the tech industry. The company tripled the size of its staff last year to 3,730 employees. Following its Nasdaq debut in April 2021, Coinbase reported a 12-fold increase in second-quarter sales to $2.28 billion, while profit climbed 4,900% to $1.6 billion.But the tech companies with the highest growth rates last year have been hit the hardest this year as investors rotate into assets deemed safer in a world of rising interest rates and soaring inflation. With bitcoin down by more than one-third this year and ethereum off by 50%, fewer people are racing to Coinbase to open accounts and make transactions.Coinbase said last month that revenue in the latest quarter fell 27% from a year earlier, while total trading volume declined from $547 billion in the fourth quarter to $309 billion in the first three months of 2022.""We always knew crypto would be volatile, but that volatility alongside larger economic factors may test the company, and us personally, in new ways,"" Brock wrote in Thursday's post.

2022-06-02,"TerraUSD or UST, is an algorithmic stablecoin which was supposed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar. But it lost its dollar peg, collapsed and sent shockwaves through the crypto market.Reeve Collins, co-founder of BLOCKv and co-founder of another stablecoin tether, said the terraUSD debacle will ""probably be the end"" of so-called algorithmic stablecoins.The crypto industry also warned that regulation is likely to come for stablecoins as global governments look at the risks in the space. Algorithmic stablecoins like terraUSD, which collapsed and sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, are unlikely to survive, the co-founder of digital currency tether told CNBC.Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is usually pegged to a real-world asset. TerraUSD or UST, is an algorithmic stablecoin which was supposed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.Whereas stablecoins like tether and USD Coin are backed by real-world assets such as fiat currencies and government bonds in order to maintain their dollar peg, UST was governed by an algorithm.UST lost its dollar peg and that also led to a sell-off for its sister token luna, which crashed to $0. The debacle has led to warnings that algorithmic stablecoins might not have a future.""It's unfortunate that the money ... was lost, however, it's not a surprise. It's an algorithmic-backed, stablecoin. So it's just a bunch of smart people trying to figure out how to peg something to the dollar,"" Reeve Collins, the co-founder of digital token company BLOCKv, told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.""And a lot of people pulled out their money in the last few months, because they realized that it wasn't sustainable. So that crash kind of had a cascade effect. And it will probably be the end of most algo stablecoins."" Collins is also the co-founder of tether, which is not an algorithmic stablecoin. But tether's issuer claims it is backed by cash, U.S. Treasurys and corporate bonds. In the crypto market turmoil last month, tether also briefly lost its dollar peg before regaining it.Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, one of the companies behind the issuance of the USDC stablecoin, said he thinks people will continue to work on algorithmic stablecoins.""I've compared algorithmic stable coins to the Fountain of Youth or the Holy Grail. Others have referred to it as financial alchemy. And so there will continue to be financial alchemists who, who work on the magic potion to to create these things, and to find ... the Holy Grail of a stable value, algorithmic digital currency. So I fully expect continued pursuit of that,"" Allaire told CNBC last week.""Now, what happens with regulation around it is a different question. Are there going to be, you know, clear lines drawn about what can interact with the market. What can interact with ... the financial system, given the risks that are embedded,"" he added. Stablecoins have been in focus for regulators and governments around the world. Earlier this year in the U.S., the Senate Banking Committee Ranking Member Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) released a draft set of rules on regulating stablecoins.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last month urged lawmakers to pass legislation around stablecoins.In April, the U.K. government announced plans to bring stablecoins under its regulatory purview. On Tuesday, the British government also released a proposal to amend existing rules to manage the failure of stablecoin firms that may pose a ""systemic"" risk. The crytpo industry is expecting tougher regulation on stablecoins, especially after terraUSD's collapse. Bertrand Perez, CEO of the Web3 Foundation and a former director of the Facebook-backed Diem stablecoin project, expects regulators to demand that such cryptocurrencies are backed by real assets.""So I expect that once we have a clear regulation of stablecoins, the basic rules of the regulation would be that you have a clear reserve with a set of assets that are strong, that you're subject to regular audits of those reserves,"" Perez told CNBC last week.""So you can have an auditing company that comes regularly to make sure that you have the proper reserves, that you have also the proper processes and measures in order to face bank runs and other, let's say, negative market conditions, to make sure that your reserve is really secure, not only when everything goes well.""Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook. "
2022-06-03,"Cryptocurrency companies dominated the main street at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, a notable difference between this edition and the last one in 2020.The recent bear market in cryptocurrency was welcomed by industry players as they said it is a chance to get rid of the bad actors and focus on building products.Many said they expect thousands of cryptocurrencies to collapse.Stablecoins and regulation were two other major topics. Cryptocurrency companies dominated the main street at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, a notable difference between this edition and the last one in 2020.The high-profile presence from the industry came even as the cryptocurrency market crashed. It was sparked by the collapse of the so-called algorithmic stablecoin called terraUSD or UST, which saw its sister token luna drop to $0 in May.Meanwhile, global regulators are setting their sights on the cryptocurrency industry.WEF is the annual gathering of global business leaders and politicians that aims to set the agenda for the year.Against that backdrop, it was the perfect time to catch up with some of the big players in the cryptocurrency industry. Here's what I learned. There are currently over 19,000 cryptocurrencies and dozens of blockchain platforms in existence.Blockchain is the technology that underpins these digital currencies and platforms include Ethereum, Solana and many others.Many of the industry executives see the current state of the market as unsustainable.Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of cross-border blockchain firm Ripple, predicted there may only be ""scores"" of cryptocurrencies left in the future. He said there are around 180 fiat currencies in the world and there is not really a need for that many cryptocurrencies. Betrand Perez, CEO of the Web3 Foundation, likened the current state of the market to the early internet era, and said there were lots of ""scams"" and many ""were not bringing any value.""Brett Harrison, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX U.S., said there are ""a couple of clear winners"" when it comes to blockchain platforms. You may have heard of stablecoins. They're a type of cryptocurrencies which are supposed to be pegged to a real world asset.In practice, stablecoins like tether or USD Coin, which aim to mirror the U.S. dollar one-to-one, are backed by real assets such as currencies or bonds. They hold a reserve of these assets in order to maintain a dollar peg. You may have also heard about the debacle surrounding a terraUSD or UST. This is a so-called algorithmic stablecoin. Instead of maintaining its peg by having a reserve of assets, it aims to mimic the U.S. dollar and maintain stability through a complex algorithm.But that algorithm failed and caused terraUSD to lose its peg and collapse.The crypto industry tried to warn users to make sure they know the difference between an algorithmic stablecoin, like terraUSD, and others that are backed by assets. The terraUSD collapse ""made it very clear to people that not all stablecoins are created equal,"" said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, one of the companies behind the issuance of USDC.""And it's helping people differentiate between a well-regulated, fully reserved, asset-backed dollar digital currency, like USDC, and something like that (terraUSD).""Reeve Collins, co-founder of BLOCKv and co-founder of another stablecoin tether, said the terraUSD saga will ""probably be the end"" of most algorithmic stablecoins. Believe it or not, the cryptocurrency industry welcomed the recent market crash, which saw major tokens like bitcoin fall more than 50% from their all-time highs.""We're in a bear market. And I think that's good. It's good, because it's going to clear the people who were there for the bad reasons,"" said the Web3 Foundation's Perez. This sentiment was echoed by other executives too, who say the massive rally in prices caused people to focus on speculation rather than building products.″[The] market, in my personal opinion, became maybe a little bit irrational, or maybe a little reckless to a certain extent. And when the times like that come, [a] correction is normally needed, and at the end of the day [is] healthy,"" said Mihailo Bjelic, CEO of Polygon. Ahead of the World Economic Forum, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said she thinks cryptocurrencies are ""worth nothing.""It appeared to me like regulators and authorities were still antagonistic to cryptocurrencies, much like they had been over the past few years at Davos.But executives said the thinking from regulators, for the most part, has shifted to something slightly more constructive.""I think we've come a long way from three or four years ago when when I literally had just arrived here in the snowy version of Davos and someone said, you know, crypto is still a bad word here. That is no longer the case. So I definitely don't think 'antagonism' would be the right descriptor. I think 'curiosity,'"" Ripple's Garlinghouse said. ""I think it's constantly changing both regulators, big enterprises. Everyone wants to be more more involved with crypto now, no one is ignoring the industry anymore,"" Polygon's Bjelic said.In March, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. Still, there is no major cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. and other major economies.Garlinghouse said that he wants ""clarity and certainty"" from regulators.BLOCKv's Collins, meanwhile, called Lagarde's comments ""ignorant."" He highlighted the tension that still exists between the cryptocurrency industry and some authorities in traditional finance. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook. "
2022-06-03,"Lawmakers in New York just passed a bill to ban certain bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources.The measure now heads to the desk of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it.If it passes, it would make New York the first state in the country to ban blockchain technology infrastructure Following an early morning vote in Albany on Friday, lawmakers in New York passed a bill to ban certain bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources. The measure now heads to the desk of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it.If Hochul signs the bill, it would make New York the first state in the country to ban blockchain technology infrastructure, according to Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Industry insiders also tell CNBC it could have a domino effect across the U.S., which is currently at the forefront of the global bitcoin mining industry, accounting for 38% of the world's miners.The New York bill, which previously passed the State Assembly in late April before heading to the State Senate, calls for a two-year moratorium on certain cryptocurrency mining operations which use proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions. Proof-of-work mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity, is used to create bitcoin. Ethereum is switching to a less energy-intensive process, but will still use this method for at least for another few months.The push for an eleventh-hour vote came as leadership in the state capitol managed to flip some of the senators who were previously undecided.Lawmakers backing the legislation say they are looking to curb the state's carbon footprint by cracking down on mines that use electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels. If it passes — for two years, unless a proof-of-work mining company uses 100% renewable energy, it would not be allowed to expand or renew permits, and new entrants would not be allowed to come online.The net effect of this, according to Boring, would be to weaken New York's economy by forcing businesses to take jobs elsewhere.""This is a significant setback for the state and will stifle its future as a leader in technology and global financial services. More importantly, this decision will eliminate critical union jobs and further disenfranchise financial access to the many underbanked populations living in the Empire State,"" Boring tells CNBC.It is a sentiment echoed by Galaxy Digital's Amando Fabiano, who says that ""New York is setting a bad precedent that other states could follow.""As for timing, the law would go into effect as soon as the governor signs off. One section of the bill involves conducting a statewide study of the environmental impact of proof-of-work mining operations on New York's ability to reach aggressive climate goals set under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which requires New York's greenhouse gas emissions be cut by 85% by 2050.Boring tells CNBC the recent swell of support in favor of this year's proposed ban has a whole lot to do with this mandate to transition to sustainable energy.""Proof-of-work mining has the potential to lead the global transition to more sustainable energy,"" Boring told CNBC's Crypto World, pointing to the irony of the moratorium. ""The bitcoin mining industry is actually leading in terms of compliance with that Act.""The sustainable energy mix of the global bitcoin mining industry today is estimated to be just under 60%, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce has found that the sustainable electricity mix is closer to 80% for its members mining in the state of New York.""The regulatory environment in New York will not only halt their target – carbon-based fuel proof of work mining – but will also likely discourage new, renewable-based miners from doing business with the state due to the possibility of more regulatory creep,"" said John Warren, CEO of institutional-grade bitcoin mining company GEM Mining.A third of New York's in-state generation comes from renewables, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. New York counts its nuclear power plants toward its 100% carbon free electricity goal, and the state produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains.The state also has a chilly climate, which means less energy is needed to cool down the banks of computers used in crypto mining, as well as a lot of abandoned industrial infrastructure that's ripe for repurposing. In a conversation at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami in April, former presidential candidate and New Yorker Andrew Yang told CNBC that when he speaks to folks in the industry, he has found mining operations can help develop demand for a renewable source of energy.""In my mind, a lot of this stuff is going to end up pushing activity to other places that might not achieve the goal of the policymakers,"" said Yang.Some in the industry aren't waiting for the state to make a ban official before taking action.Data from digital currency company Foundry shows that New York's share of the bitcoin mining network dropped from 20% to 10% in a matter of months, as miners began migrating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions in other parts of the country.""Our customers are being scared off from investing in New York state,"" said Kevin Zhang of Foundry.""Even from Foundry's deployments of $500 million in capital towards mining equipment, less than 5% has gone to New York because of the unfriendly political landscape,"" continued Zhang. If the crypto mining moratorium is signed into law by the governor, it could have a number of follow-on effects.Beyond potentially stifling investment in more sustainable energy sources, industry advocates tell CNBC that each of these facilities drives significant economic impact with many local vendors consisting of electricians, engineers, and construction workers. An exodus of crypto miners, according to experts, could translate to jobs and tax dollars moving out of state.""There are many labor unions who are against this bill because it could have dire economic consequences,"" said Boring. ""Bitcoin mining operations are providing high-paying and high-grade, great jobs for local communities. One of our members, their average pay is $80,000 a year.""As Boring points out, New York is a leader when it comes to state legislation, so there is also the potential for a copycat phenomenon rippling across the country.""Other blue states often follow the lead of New York state and this would be giving them an easy template to replicate,"" said Zhang, Foundry's SVP of Mining Strategy.""Sure, the network will be fine — it survived a nation-state attack from China last summer — but the implications for where the technology will scale and develop in the future are massive,"" continued Zhang.However, many others in the industry think concerns over the fallout of a mining moratorium in New York are overblown.Veteran bitcoin miners like Core Scientific co-founder Darin Feinstein say the industry already knows New York is generally hostile to the crypto mining business.""There's no reason to go into a region that doesn't want you,"" said Feinstein. ""Bitcoin miners are really a data center business, and the data center needs to locate in jurisdictions that want to have data centers within their borders...If you're going to ignore that, then you have to deal with the consequences of conducting business in a region that doesn't want your business.""Feinstein and other miners point out that there are plenty of friendlier jurisdictions: Georgia, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming have all become major mining destinations.Texas, for example, has crypto-friendly lawmakers, a deregulated power grid with real-time spot pricing, and access to significant excess renewable energy, as well as stranded or flared natural gas. The state's regulatory friendliness toward miners also makes the industry very predictable, according to Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners.""It is a very attractive environment for miners to deploy large amounts of capital in,"" he said. ""The sheer number of land deals and power purchase agreements that are in various stages of negotiation is enormous."" Meanwhile, the Biden Administration is formulating its own policy targeting bitcoin mining — with an aim to mitigate energy consumption and emissions.The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is examining the connections between distributed ledger technology and energy transitions, the potential for these technologies to impede or advance efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad, and the impacts these technologies have on the environment, according to Dr. Costa Samaras, who is the principal assistant director for energy.The effort is one of the deliverables spelled out in the president's executive order that was issued in March.Samaras tells CNBC that the White House is specifically examining the role these technologies might play in accounting for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as potentially supporting the buildout of a clean electricity grid.They're also ""taking a look at the implications for energy policy, including how cryptocurrencies can affect grid management and reliability.""It is unclear whether these recommendations, which are due in September, will culminate in federal law on proof-of-work mining. For now, states are calling the shots."
2022-06-03,"More than 46,000 people say they lost over $1 billion in crypto to scams since the start of 2021, according to a report released by the Federal Trade Commission on Friday. Losses last year were nearly sixty times what they were in 2018, with a median individual loss of $2,600.  More than 46,000 people say they lost over $1 billion in crypto to scams since the start of 2021, according to a report released by the Federal Trade Commission on Friday.Losses last year were nearly 60 times what they were in 2018, with a median individual loss of $2,600.The FTC notes that the top cryptocurrencies people said they used to pay scammers were bitcoin (70%), tether (10%), and ether (9%).One key feature of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is that payment transfers are final and can't be reversed. This isn't always a good thing. Chargebacks — a type of tool designed to protect consumers — allow consumers to reverse a transaction if they claim they have been fraudulently charged for a good or service they did not receive.Nearly half the people who reported losing crypto to a scam since 2021 said it started with some kind of message on a social media platform. The top platforms mentioned in these complaints were Instagram (32%), Facebook (26%), WhatsApp (9%), and Telegram (7%). Fake investment opportunities were by far the most common type of scam. In 2021, $575 million of crypto fraud losses reported to the FTC related to investment opportunities. People reported that investment websites and apps would let them track the growth of their crypto, but the apps were fake, and when they tried to get their money out they could not.""There's no bank or other centralized authority to flag suspicious transactions and attempt to stop fraud before it happens,"" the FTC warns in its report. ""These considerations are not unique to crypto transactions, but they all play into the hands of scammers.""Romance scams are the second-most common source of crypto fraud losses, followed by business and government impersonation scams, which the FTC said can often start with fake messages purporting to be from tech companies like Amazon or Microsoft.Younger consumers were more likely to be taken in by crypto scams. The FTC reports that people aged 20 to 49 were more than three times as likely as older age groups to report losing crypto to a scammer.To avoid being scammed, the FTC says, people should understand that cryptocurrency investments never have guaranteed returns, avoid business arrangements that require a crypto purchase, and watch out for romantic come-ons accompanied by a crypto solicitation.The news comes after a tumultuous few weeks in the crypto markets. A failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin helped drag down the entire crypto asset class, erasing half a trillion dollars from the sector's market cap and denting investor confidence in the process. Many institutional and retail investors got wiped out, and for the most part, there are no backstops from the FDIC, nor any other consumer insurance protections.Billionaire bitcoiners Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss recently announced layoffs at crypto exchange Gemini, citing the fact that the industry is in a ""contraction phase"" known as ""crypto winter,"" which has been ""further compounded by the current macroeconomic and geopolitical turmoil."""
2022-06-04,"""Right now, the crypto world is in crisis, having lost trillions of dollars. We're in a bear market,"" Deepak Chopra recently told CNBC at Gary Vaynerchuk's ""VeeCon"" in Minneapolis.But the wellness icon says now is a time for investors to focus on the long-term opportunity in financial markets, including crypto.Earlier this year, Chopra's foundation partnered with crypto crowdfunding platform EarthFund to launch a collection of NFT tokens aimed at helping people achieve mental and emotional health. It's been a brutal stretch for the crypto market, and a hard time for cryptocurrency investors to keep their emotions in check.The sector's market cap collapse was led by terraUSD, one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, which imploded virtually overnight. But bitcoin and ethereum, too, saw massive price declines from their recent bull market highs.A cultural icon known for being in touch with emotions — and for his recent foray into the NFT space — Deepak Chopra says investors can't ignore the recent crypto market meltdown, but they should be able to see beyond it.""The crypto world is in crisis, having lost trillions of dollars. We're in a bear market,"" Chopra recently told CNBC at Gary Vaynerchuk's ""VeeCon"" in Minneapolis.""Right now is the time to think long-term in these financial markets, including crypto. I think emergence happens when you have maximum diversity of people hanging in there creatively, complimenting each other's strengths and having some kind of a spiritual and emotional ecosystem where they can help each other and that's happening right now in the crypto community,"" Chopra said. It is unclear whether the recent rout marks the next ""crypto winter"" — a multiyear bear market that occurs on a cyclical basis for the crypto asset class — though dropping trading volumes on crypto exchanges is one sign that we may be headed in that direction. The last so-called crypto winter ran from 2018 into the fall of 2020 as the value of cryptocurrencies plunged and layoffs were rife.There are more than 19,000 cryptocurrencies in existence and dozens of blockchain platforms, the underlying technology that cryptocurrencies are built upon. Not all will survive, and some crypto industry leaders expect a period of ""creative destruction"" wiping out many players.Mark Cuban, who has become a big investor in blockchain-based technologies, recently compared the crypto crash to ""the lull that the internet went through"" during the dotcom bubble. He tweeted that there are too many imitators out there. ""The chains that copy what everyone else has, will fail,"" Cuban tweeted. ""We don't need NFTs or DeFi on every chain.""Earlier this year, Chopra's foundation partnered with crypto crowdfunding platform EarthFund to launch a collection of NFT tokens aimed at helping people achieve mental and emotional health. Token holders can earn rewards that allow them to ""crowdfund a treasury and decide as a community which mental well-being projects get the funding they need to make a difference,"" according to a March statement.The Chopra Foundation has also participated in Hollywood actress Emilia Clarke's SameYou NFT initiative launched in November 2021, which aims to provide better treatment of those recovering from the injuries of brain stroke and injury.""We're using artificial intelligence to talk to people who are feeling mentally challenged and if they need counseling, we have a token with EarthFund so that we can democratize well-being all over the world,"" Chopra said. ""This is the future. We want to create global communities of attention, affection, appreciation and acceptance, where people are there to support each other and have each others backs.""NFTs are a type of digital asset created to track ownership of a virtual item using blockchain technology. Earlier this week, U.S. prosecutors announced that they're pursuing an insider trading charge involving these digital assets for the first time.""I hope people don't get sucked into the melodrama [of NFTs], because the markets always reflect the fickle human mind. One day it's up, one day it's down, one bit of news and we're in a bull market, the next day there's bad news and we're in a bear market,"" Chopra said.""Ultimately, history has shown that economic development will happen because we are creative human beings, but we have to hang in there and support each other. It's not a time for competition right now, but cooperation,"" he added."
2022-06-04,"Assemblymember Anna Kelles speaks to CNBC about her New York mining moratorium bill.""It's important to understand that it's not a ban,"" she said.But critics say it singles out a particular use of energy — crypto mining — rather than the type of energy being used, in the name of meeting the state's climate goals. New York State Assemblymember Anna Kelles is tired of all the fear-mongering about the bill she wrote — and sponsored — to place a two-year moratorium on certain types of new cryptocurrency mines in the state. The fate of the measure, which passed the state senate in the wee hours of Friday morning, rests in the hands of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it.""It's important to understand that it's not a ban,"" Kelles said in a call with CNBC on Friday.""It's like a three-page bill. So it would be wonderful to just have people read it, but it often ends up being an interpretation based on emotions.""The legislation aims to curb the state's carbon footprint by cracking down on crypto mines that meet very specific criteria.For one, they need to use the energy-intensive proof-of-work authentication method to validate blockchain transactions. Second, they must draw electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels. Within that subcategory of mines, the measure only applies to those looking to expand or renew permits, while new entrants would not be allowed to come online.Proof-of-work mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity, is virtually synonymous with bitcoin. Ethereum is switching to a less energy-intensive process, but will still use this method for at least for another few months.""If there is a cryptocurrency mining operation, like there is one in Syracuse, where there are thousands of cryptocurrency mining computer processors, and they are directly tied into the grid: It is not a moratorium on that facility,"" explained Kelles, who disclosed to CNBC that she does not own any cryptocurrencies but actively researches the sector.In addition, it won't affect existing operations in power plants because it's not retroactive, nor will it impact ""boutique or small-scale cryptocurrency miners that are doing, you know, four, five, ten, twenty computers in their basement,"" she said.Kelles says that her bill is essentially just a big pause button, designed to halt the actions of a corner of the state's crypto mining industry running on coal- and natural gas-based power plants. Those energy sources interfere with the state's aggressive climate laws requiring it to become net-neutral in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.""It's very narrow, and it won't, in any way, affect anyone's ability to buy, use, sell or invest in any cryptocurrency, including any cryptocurrency that is based off of proof-of-work validation methods like bitcoin,"" continued Kelles. The crypto mining industry has banded together to challenge the legislation.Miners tell CNBC that even though this bill is relatively narrow, they're concerned about the possibility of regulatory creep.""A moratorium and ban on how a miner sources energy — behind the meter versus grid — is not hospitable to miners,"" said Marathon Digital's Fred Thiel.""New York has a grid congestion issue which is not at all impacted by behind-the-meter energy consumption,"" continued Thiel. ""In the end, this is sending a message to miners to stay away from New York, because these are only the first steps in what may become a wholesale ban of mining in the state.""Miners make large capital investments that can require up to five years to provide a payback, plus return on investment. Thiel says that no company is willing to risk investing in a state where after two years, or even sooner, they might be forced to shut down and relocate.  Kelles tells CNBC that crypto miners challenging the bill sound a whole lot like the oil and gas industry. She says both use lines, such as, ""If you do this, in the future, it will put a damper on free trade and free commerce – and any regulation is bad.""She also isn't worried about crypto miners leaving New York because ultimately, like any company, their interest is profits. Miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry where their only variable cost is typically energy, so they are incentivized to migrate to the world's cheapest sources of power – which also tend to be renewable. New York is a bastion of cheap and renewable energy, which is a huge draw for the industry.A third of New York's in-state generation comes from renewables, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the state produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains.""The oldest and largest cryptocurrency mining operation in the country is in New York State, and it is fully on hydroelectric. Hydroelectric can't be picked up and moved,"" said Kelles, who also noted that hydropower is the cheapest form of renewable energy.In addition, the state has a chilly climate, which means less energy is needed to cool down the banks of computers used in crypto mining. New York has a lot of abandoned industrial infrastructure that's ripe for repurposing, as well. ""To say that miners can pick up and leave and go to any state and have access to that form of energy...I think that it is fear-mongering to say that,"" said Kelles. However, some data suggests miners began leaving New York for friendlier political jurisdictions like Wyoming and Texas last year, ahead of the anticipated crackdown. Data from digital currency company Foundry shows that New York's share of the bitcoin mining network dropped from 20% to 10% between Oct. 2021 and the end of January.""Our customers are being scared off from investing in New York state,"" said Kevin Zhang of crypto mining pool Foundry.""Even from Foundry's deployments of $500 million in capital towards mining equipment, less than 5% has gone to New York because of the unfriendly political landscape,"" continued Zhang. The real sticking point of the legislation comes down to the question of who to regulate: The proof-of-work crypto miners or the energy generators.""It is a two-year moratorium on the use of power plants,"" Kelles said. ""Some of my colleagues say, 'You know, this is really a power plant bill.'""That logic irks some crypto miners.""If this was only about refiring coal-fired plants then it would be much easier – and more fair – to just ban refiring coal-fired plants,"" said Thiel. ""Problem solved.""Some of the biggest names in bitcoin — including Jack Dorsey, Tom Lee, Nic Carter, and Michael Saylor — recently co-signed a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency in which they took issue with congressional Democrats conflating data centers with power generation facilities. The issue was totally separate from New York's moratorium bill, but the same reasoning applies.The rebuttal letter said data centers that contain ""miners″ are no different than data centers owned and operated by Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. According to the letter, each is just a building in which electricity powers IT equipment to run computing workloads.""Regulating what data centers allow their computers to do would be a massive shift in policy in the United States,"" the letter read.Kelles says the New York bill isn't singling out crypto miners over other large energy consumers — it's just that ""there are no other energy consumers that are buying power plants.""""This is not about the industry, this is about the use of power plants,"" she said.But Castle Island Venture's Nic Carter makes the case that New York is now ""regulating the contents of the data center"" and has effectively ""banned a kind of computation.""""They're directly controlling what constitutes a valid use of power,"" Carter wrote in a tweet. Kelles says the key here is to make sure the state isn't making emotionally or politically based decisions. She says that's why the second half of the bill, which requires the state government to evaluate the impact of the industry, is the most important part of it.""Our scientific experts and environmental experts will be collecting data about the industry's impact on our ability to reach our CLCPA goals,"" she said, referring to the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. The CLCPA is ""among the most ambitious climate laws in the world"" and requires New York to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030 and no less than 85% by 2050 (from 1990 levels). Kelles says the two-year moratorium on the purchasing of fossil fuel-based power plants in New York will give scientists and experts from the Department of Environmental Conservation the time they need to complete a comprehensive and transparent environmental impact statement.""The charge for them, as outlined in the bill, is to evaluate the impact of the cryptocurrency mining industry on our ability to reach our CLCPA goals,"" continued Kelles.It is unclear whether the investigation will also examine the ways in which proof-of-work miners might help with grid resilience and incentivizing the buildout of renewable infrastructure.Texas, for example, has served as a case study in how bitcoin mines can help stabilize power grids by ensuring that demand is always even with supply.Bitcoin miners have also improved the economics of renewables. When these energy buyers co-locate with renewables, it creates a financial incentive for buildout and improves the core economics of renewable power production, which has been fraught with volatility."
2022-06-04,"As companies navigate having both in-office and at-home workers, the role of the traditional office is being reconsidered.Having less people in an office every day could mean cutting space, but those spaces need to better suit the workforce of today, executives say.How that experience evolves could be the difference between workers coming back to the office smoothly or leaving their jobs. As companies and workers continue to try to figure out where and how work will take place in a hybrid environment, the costs being spent on existing office spaces previously built around the 9-to-5, five-day workweek are being closely examined.Flexibility has become the buzzword for both sides of the employee-employer power dynamic. Workers have been leveraging the empowerment gains they've made amid the pandemic and a tight labor market to maintain the personal time that has come with working from home. Companies, many fearful of eroding culture that could increase turnover as well as stifling innovation by having a mostly remote workforce, have tried to meet workers somewhere in the middle by gently prodding, not pushing, workers back to the office.The question becomes then, how does that impact budgeting and spending on typically costly workspaces when a large portion of your workforce won't be there every day, if it all? Is there an opportunity to cut costs, or do those spaces now require additional investment to try to draw workers who are at home back into the office?Scott Dussault, the CFO of HR tech company Workhuman and himself a pandemic-era hire, is seeing the change firsthand.""I always quote Larry Fink's [2022] letter [to CEOs] where he said no relationship has been changed more by the pandemic than the one between employer and employee; that's never going to change and we're never going back,"" Dussault, a member of the CNBC CFO Council, said. ""The concept of 9-to-5 in the office five days a week is gone – the keyword is going to be flexibility.""For many companies that means retrofitting offices to meet this new normal and employee demands, while also investing in other tools to make sure connections are still being made efficiently – efforts that could mean spending more money even if square footage or leases are adjusted.""I'm not so sure it's going to be a cost negative,"" Dussault said. ""I'm not sure if people are going to take less real estate; they're just going to change the way that real estate works.""Workhuman is currently coming towards the end of its lease in its Boston-area headquarters, and Dussault said the company is considering expanding its space, which would provide a ""clean slate"" to adjust to this new working environment.He recalled his time at a job in the 1990s where it was a ""football field of cubicles"" – the kind of situation where you could ""go to work and sit in a cube all day and never interact with anybody – you truly could lose that connection.""Dussault said he sees the office becoming what he calls a ""collaboration destination,"" part of a hybrid environment where while you might work from home on days where you're catching up on work or emails, the office can serve as a space that is ""all about connection.""""You're going to see a lot more open spaces, collaboration spaces, conference rooms, meeting rooms, break areas where people can sit and get together,"" he said. ""It's going be focused on connection which I think frankly is positive and it is evolution – it's going to be about making those connections more meaningful.""That would mean investing more in things like a gym, where employees could take a physical break, or other spaces that would provide a place to take an emotional break or meditate, Dussault said, something he said results in costs shifting ""from one bucket to another.""""We need to understand and recognize that when employees are home and productive, they have those things, and we need to try to make sure that those things exist in the office as well,"" he said.That also puts a further onus on the investment in digital tools, because there still needs to be ways for workers to connect with peers even when they're not in person.""Companies always talk about how important employees are and how employees are the most important investment – they haven't always acted that way,"" he said. ""This is a good thing that's come out of the pandemic.""Neal Narayani, chief people officer at fintech company Brex, noted that in 2019 the company had people coming into offices five days a week in San Francisco, New York, Vancouver, and Salt Lake City. At that time, ""nobody worked from home, because it was seen as a negative,"" Narayani said. But as the pandemic forced employees to work from home, where they successfully took on several large projects, that view shifted.""We recognized very quickly that we were able to actually work more productively and faster, and that video collaboration is a very productive tool when you don't have to commute somewhere to search the office for a conference room,"" he said.With a belief that a remote-first approach was the future of work, Brex leaned in. Of the company's more than 1,200 employees, 45% are fully remote. The company still maintains those four office location hubs where workers can go if they want, but the company has altered its approach so that every process is designed for remote workers.That also changed the thinking that went into those spaces as Brex planned out its growth.""When you unwind the real estate costs, we were able to look at how many people would come into an office if we were to make it fully optional, and it was about 10%,"" Narayani said. ""So, we were able to move into a 10%, maybe even less, real estate option, and then take the rest of those dollars and repurpose that towards travel, towards talent development, towards diversity and inclusion efforts, and towards anything else that makes the employee experience better.""""It turns out to be a much better experience for us because that real estate cost was very high, and those markets are very expensive,"" he added.Roughly a third of the cost of the company's previous real estate strategy has been put into the company's new off-site strategy, Narayani said, with other portions of that being used to pay for the four office spaces and other co-working spaces.Larry Gadea, CEO of workplace technology company Envoy, said that he thinks many companies are looking at ways they can reduce costs right now, with office space spending as one area potentially ripe for cuts.However, Gadea warns that ""people need to be together with each other, they need to know each other.""""They need to have a sense of purpose that's unified, and you need to bring people together for that,"" he said. ""How are you going to bring people together when they're all around the country? I think that there is a substantial amount of people thinking they're going to be saving money on real estate, but United and other airlines and Hilton and other hotels are getting it instead.""Gadea said that as companies try to manage a tight labor environment as well as other market challenges, more time needs to be spent on ""thinking about how to bring teams together.""""The number one reason that most people stick with a company is that they love the people they work with,"" he said. ""It can be a lot harder to love those people if you don't ever see them because they turned off their video on Zoom or if they don't even know them at all."""
2022-06-06,"Bitcoin moved higher over the weekend as cryptocurrency investors continue to look for a bottom following a rough six months of selling.The largest cryptocurrency by market cap rose 4.3% Monday to $31,278.09, according to Coin Metrics. Ether advanced nearly 2% to $1,852.64.Crypto has continued to move in tandem with stocks. All three of the major stock averages were higher on Monday, too. Investors have been holding their breath while watching prices across risk assets move higher, uncertain if the moves are temporary or if a more permanent reversal is finally here.Some still say it's too early, however.""We believe this relief rally is a bull trap, and that bitcoin may have a short-lived gain but is more than likely going to resume the downward trend we've seen for the past two months,"" said Josh Olszewicz, head of research at Valkyrie Investments. ""Uncertainty in the global economy due to high inflation and the likelihood we are in a recession, paired with the prevalence of central bankers raising rates, is likely going to force all assets downward at least through the end of the summer.""""We still believe this confluence of factors is likely to lead bitcoin to fall as low as $22,000 before rallying later this year, mainly because that level is where many institutions and large corporates bought in and they are highly unlikely to let their trade go too far underwater,"" he added. Last week, bitcoin and ether both turned green for their first positive week in nine, according to Coin Metrics. That was the longest-running losing streak for the cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin has more than halved since hitting its all-time high of $68,982.20 in November. It was trading in a tight range this year before falling below $30,000 this month after the Terra collapse.""Token prices fell 27% in May, following a 20% decline in April,"" said Kenneth Worthington, a JPMorgan research analyst, in a note Monday. ""The already challenged April environment was exacerbated in May by the collapse of the UST algorithmic stablecoin that drove a combination of forced selling and uncertainty to negatively impact the broader cryptoecosystem. While trading volume appears somewhat higher in May from a depressed April, nearly all the other gauges of growth declined this past month.""Worthington also said crypto is ""in need of a fresh catalyst,"" and that it could be the Ethereum merge.Last month, another JPMorgan strategist, London-based Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, said he sees about 30% upside for bitcoin after the recent washout."

WASHINGTON — A week after prominent technologists publicly slammed crypto for being too risky and unproven in a letter to Congress, human rights advocates from around the world have sent a rebuttal to U.S. lawmakers defending digital assets for the access they provide to people in countries where ""local currencies are collapsing, broken, or cut off from the outside world.""Some 21 human rights supporters from 20 different countries said in the letter that they've relied on bitcoin and stablecoins, which allow the trading in and out of crypto without going through a bank, ""as have tens of millions of others living under authoritarian regimes or unstable economies.""The lobbying of U.S. legislators comes as Congress considers laws that would regulate digital assets, which have been particularly volatile this year. Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo, and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, introduced legislation on Tuesday to create a regulatory framework for the crypto markets. Because U.S. lawmakers effectively set policy and standards for the world, a draconian response in Washington, D.C., could have major repercussions across the globe.Beyond their use in trading and speculative investing, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen increased utility in recent months, as people from numerous different countries sent tens of millions of dollars to Ukraine via crypto payment rails to support the war effort and the defense against Russia.Meanwhile, Ukrainians fleeing the country were able to take their money with them in the form of cryptocurrency stored on a USB drive. A similar narrative played out in Afghanistan in August, when the Taliban took over the country and banks there closed down.""Bitcoin provides financial inclusion and empowerment because it is open and permissionless,"" the latest letter said.

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital collectibles that have soared and crashed in value at various times over the past year.But Gladstein and his allies say that perspective comes from people in the West, who have never experienced ""the horrors of monetary colonialism, misogynist financial policy, frozen bank accounts, exploitative remittance companies, and an inability to connect to the global economy.""""If the Congress intends to restrict the ability of Americans to use bitcoin, it needs to know that this is going to have significant negative effects for the millions of people who rely on it worldwide,"" said Gladstein.WATCH: Sen.

2022-06-07,"Checkout.com said it will let settle payments in the stablecoin USDC through a partnership with crypto security firm Fireblocks.The $40 billion start-up is the latest major financial institution jumping into crypto; rival payments group Stripe launched a similar feature earlier this year.Regulators have gotten worried about stablecoins after the collapse of UST, a token that aimed to maintain a $1 peg using code rather than a reserve of assets. AMSTERDAM — Online payments company Checkout.com says it will settle payments for its merchants round-the-clock using stablecoins, making it the last major financial services firm taking the plunge into crypto.The start-up, which competes with the likes of PayPal and Stripe, said Tuesday it is launching a feature that allows businesses to accept and make payments in USD Coin, a popular stablecoin that's pegged to the U.S. dollar. Checkout.com said it is offering the new payment method through a partnership with Fireblocks, a crypto security firm.related investing newsMorgan Stanley sees a sign that points to a top in bitcoinTanaya Macheel16 hours agoStablecoins are a key part of the crypto market, helping investors trade in and out of digital currencies rapidly without having to go through banks. With a circulating supply of more than $50 billion, USDC is the world's second-biggest stablecoin.The feature will allow merchants to settle payments even on weekends and public holidays, something that's not currently possible with fiat currencies, according to Jess Houlgrave, Checkout.com's head of crypto strategy. She used the example of someone buying bitcoin from a crypto exchange. While the user can get their bitcoin straight away, how banks and card schemes like Visa and Mastercard operate means merchants may not receive the funds for several days.""Between the time that they've sent the bitcoin, and the time that they receive those funds, they have a working capital constraint,"" Houlgrave told CNBC on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam.Checkout.com said it has tested the feature privately with select clients, facilitating $300 million in transaction volumes in the past few months. It now plans to roll the product out globally, with Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX among the first to use it.Last valued at $40 billion, Checkout.com is the latest major financial institution betting big on crypto. Stripe recently launched its own stablecoin payments feature, allowing Twitter creators to get paid in USDC. Such developments come at a time when cryptocurrencies have tumbled sharply from the peak of a seismic rally last year. Bitcoin has more than halved in value since an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in November.Unlike bitcoin, stablecoins aren't meant to fluctuate that much in price. They're designed to be tied to the value of traditional assets like the dollar. But recent events have put stablecoins' main selling point to the test. Last month, a so-called stablecoin called terraUSD imploded after falling below its intended dollar peg, shaking investors' confidence in cryptocurrencies. TerraUSD, or UST, used code to maintain a price of $1. That's different to more mainstream stablecoins like tether and USDC, which are backed by cash and other assets.Tether, meanwhile, also briefly slipped below a dollar on numerous exchanges as crypto investors fled the token due to panic over the UST debacle. Tether, which has long faced questions over its stablecoin's backing, said it processed more than $10 billion in redemption requests in May.Regulators are getting worried about the phenomenon. Last week, the U.K. government announced new proposals that would give the Bank of England the power to intervene and manage the collapse of certain stablecoins if they pose a risk to financial stability. Stateside, Treasury Janet Yellen also wants the U.S. lawmakers to approve stablecoin regulation by the end of the year."
2022-06-07,"Sens. Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand introduced legislation Tuesday to create a regulatory framework for the crypto markets.The Lummis-Gillibrand bill would classify the vast majority of digital assets as commodities.The Responsible Financial Innovation Act would empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate most of the industry. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis introduced the first major bipartisan legislation aimed at taming the ""Wild West"" crypto market on Tuesday that would classify digital assets as commodities like wheat or oil and empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to rein in the nascent industry.Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York who sits on the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Lummis, a first-term Republican from Wyoming on the Banking Committee, said the Responsible Financial Innovation Act is the culmination of months of collaboration in the House and Senate and represents a critical first attempt to structure the markets for digital assets with long-awaited legal definitions. Their offices touted the bill as ""landmark bipartisan legislation that will create a complete regulatory framework for digital assets that encourages responsible financial innovation, flexibility, transparency and robust consumer protections while integrating digital assets into existing law.""  CNBC PoliticsRead more of CNBC's politics coverage:Republicans walk out of debt ceiling talks, say White House isn't being 'reasonable'GOP Sen.

Tim Scott of South Carolina files paperwork to run for presidentG-7 leaders commit to more Russia sanctions with Ukraine's Zelenskyy set to attend summit The cornerstone of the legislation is how it defines the vast number of digital assets available to American investors and consumers. With few exceptions, the bill designates digital currencies as ""ancillary assets,"" or intangible, fungible assets that are offered or sold in tandem with a purchase and sale of a security. Those ancillary assets would be treated like commodities under U.S. law and fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC.Aides to Gillibrand and Lummis said their proposed law treats all digitals assets as ""ancillary"" unless they behave like a security a corporation would issue to investors to build capital.   Cryptocurrencies and other digital coins won't be treated like traditional securities under the Securities and Exchange Commission's scrutiny unless the holder is entitled to the privileges enjoyed by corporate investors like dividends, liquidation rights or a financial interest in the issuer, the aides told reporters. While staffers described the bill as a mix of input from politicians on both sides of the political aisle, they acknowledged its size and complexity could force lawmakers to break it up and attempt to pass its components piece by piece.They added that the bill is a product of months of discussion with fellow senators, including Republicans such as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Pat Toomey, as well as Democrats like Ron Wyden. ""My home state of Wyoming has gone to great lengths to lead the nation in digital asset regulation, and I want to bring that success to the federal level,"" Lummis said in a press release. ""As this industry continues to grow, it is critical that Congress carefully crafts legislation that promotes innovation while protecting the consumer against bad actors."" Gillibrand said their bill will ""provide clarity to both industry and regulators, while also maintaining the flexibility to account for the ongoing evolution of the digital assets market,"" according to the press release.The CFTC and SEC together regulate wide swaths of the U.S. markets and act as two powerful Wall Street watchdogs. The former oversees the purchase and sale of raw commodities like corn, coffee, gold and oil, while the latter polices companies, executives and securities that seek to raise capital from the public.Daniel Kahan, a lawyer in King & Spalding's cryptocurrency and blockchain group, told CNBC that the legislation is likely a welcome development for investors who believe that the SEC's rules don't make much sense for decentralized digital tokens.""In part, it's because the securities regulatory regime is so prescriptive,"" Kahan, who often represents financial technology companies, said. ""There's a focus on all of these technical elements of the regime around reporting and trading and other things that are not directly tied to fraud.""The belief is that the CFTC ""would be much more appropriate to focus on investor protection and anti-fraud and anti-market-manipulation-type issues rather than on these very technical prescriptive elements of the current securities law regime,"" he added.Aides for both senators touted key features of the bill in a call with reporters, including certain tax exemptions that would shield stablecoin holders from having to report income changes each time they make a purchase with digital currency. Other new disclosures would inform investors about issuers' experience developing digital assets, the price history of issuers' prior assets, anticipated costs, and descriptions of the management teams and liabilities of each issuer. While it is up to Congress to decide how government agencies police U.S. markets, the SEC and its chairman, Gary Gensler, had for more than a year led the public crusade in support of tighter crypto rules. ""Currently, we just don't have enough investor protection in crypto finance, issuance, trading, or lending,"" Gensler told lawmakers in September. ""Frankly, at this time, it's more like the Wild West or the old world of 'buyer beware' that existed before the securities laws were enacted.""  Representatives for Lummis and Gillibrand said they worked with the SEC on their plan, and spent weeks trying to remedy concerns voiced by the regulator's attorneys that the legislation would cede too much power. Ultimately, the senators decided it best to grant more authority to the CFTC.They also said that fees collected from digital asset issuers would play an important role in augmenting the CFTC's budget to take on what's expected to be a deluge of regulatory oversight. Asked for comment, CFTC spokesman Steven Adamske confirmed the commission provided the senators with technical assistance and referred CNBC to a February statement made by CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam.""I believe many of the CFTC's regulatory principles that have made the U.S. derivatives markets the strongest in the world can also serve to aggressively address many of the risks of digital assets,"" he said at the time. ""The continued emergence of digital asset technology presents risks and opportunities, and the CFTC stands ready to leverage its expertise and experience to confront both.""The SEC did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment.Input from both agencies is critical to the legal debate in the U.S. on how to define cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. The Gillibrand and Lummis bill, for example, defines a ""digital asset"" as a natively electronic asset that confers economic or proprietary access rights or powers and includes virtual currency and payment stablecoins. It later defines virtual currency as a digital asset that is used ""primarily"" as a medium of exchange, unit of account or a store of value and is not backed by an underlying financial asset.  The industry has hired more than 200 officials and staff from the White House, Congress, Federal Reserve and political campaigns, according to the Tech Transparency Project. Meanwhile, crypto executives have contributed more than $30 million toward federal candidates and campaigns since the start of the 2020 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission data.It's not surprising to see senators propose relatively light regulation for the crypto industry after investors and executives poured that much into campaigns, said Dennis Kelleher, a co-founder of Better Markets, a prominent financial reform advocacy group.Kelleher, who served on President Joe Biden's transition team, said that handing crypto regulation to the CFTC is a deliberate attempt to shove responsibility onto an agency that Congress has left without resources for years.He said the legislation, in effect, deregulates crypto because the CFTC isn't equipped to regulate the complex and fast-growing sector. ""Actually, in my view, it's much worse because it's designed to make the public think it's regulating crypto,"" he said.""The CFTC is the smallest financial regulator with the smallest budget,"" he said. ""Wall Street and its allies in Congress have made sure that the CFTC has been chronically underfunded for years, making it impossible for the CFTC to even fulfill its current responsibilities.""Both Lummis and Gillibrand want to work with their peers to develop their respective states into blockchain and crypto havens. In the Empire State, New York City Mayor Eric Adams invested his early paychecks in bitcoin and ether, while U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat representing the Bronx, said in March that his city ""should and must embrace crypto if it is to remain the financial capital of the world."" Wyoming, meanwhile, edited its laws in 2019 to create a novel type of bank charter called a special purpose depository institution to accommodate crypto start-ups and trading platforms and remains on an aggressive track to diversify into finance and away from old-school industries like coal and gas. Left underregulated by the CFTC, Kelleher said the crypto market could grow into a larger systemic risk.""Giving the CFTC jurisdiction over crypto is like New York City outsourcing crime fighting to a small-town police force,"" he said. ""You might see a cop every now and then, but by and large, the criminals are going to be running the place."""
2022-06-08,"Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money"" and Investing Club, is a ""believer"" in cryptocurrencies, but only as a speculative investment that's a small part of your portfolio — less than 5%.""I can't tell you not to own crypto; I own ethereum,"" Cramer tells CNBC Make It.Cramer initially bought it in order to bid on an NFT, or non-fungible token, at a charity event. ""They wouldn't let me do dollars,"" he says. ""I had to buy it in ethereum, so I researched it, and it's got some qualities I like.""Cramer argues that crypto's long-term value ""is its timeliness"" as a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency that could be widely adopted over time. He recommends bitcoin and ethereum, which have the largest followings and ""seem the most legitimate.""Owning crypto can also be a good short-term bet that takes advantage of the momentum from swings in its price, especially since there are many enthusiastic investors in the space who are willing to ""buy high,"" he says.However, there's a catch: ""You must admit that it's speculative"" and know your bet might not pay off. As with any investment, past performance is no guarantee of future returns.The recent downturn in the crypto market underscores this risk, as there's no way of knowing how much crypto might decline in value. This is why experts typically advise investors only put in as much money as they're comfortable losing.Because of these risks, Cramer says you should never borrow money to own crypto: ""Borrow for your house, borrow for your car — but don't borrow for crypto.""Crypto should also be treated differently than safer long-term investments, like blue-chip stocks. ""Don't put it in the Procter & Gamble class. It's not Coca-Cola, it's not Apple,"" he says.  Cramer recommends allocating no more than 5% of your investments to crypto, as well as up to 5% in gold, another speculative investment.Despite the inherent risks in owning crypto, Cramer says he would never discourage someone from investing because of ""all the fortunes that have been made in it.""

2022-06-08,"Cryptocurrencies are a ""threat to the safety of our payment schemes,"" Anne Boden, CEO of U.K. digital bank Starling, warned Tuesday.Regulators are concerned about the financial system becoming more entwined with the volatile world of crypto.Roughly $400 billion has been erased from the combined value of all cryptocurrencies in the past month. AMSTERDAM — The boss of Goldman Sachs-backed digital bank Starling has doubled down on criticisms of crypto, calling digital currencies a threat to the safety of payment infrastructure.""It is very dangerous,"" Anne Boden, who founded Starling in 2014, warned Tuesday at the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam. Based in Britain, Starling offers fee-free checking accounts and loans through an app. The firm was last privately valued at £2.5 billion ($3.1 billion) and counts the likes of Goldman and Fidelity as investors.""A lot of [crypto] wallets are being connected directly to payment schemes,"" Boden said. ""This is a threat to the safety of our payment schemes around the world.""Major payment players are embracing cryptocurrencies — credit card giants Mastercard and Visa opened their networks to digital assets, for example, while PayPal also lets users trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Regulators are concerned about the financial system becoming more entwined with the volatile world of crypto.Roughly $400 billion has been erased from the combined value of all cryptocurrencies in the past month, as investors were rattled by the collapse of terraUSD, a popular so-called stablecoin that was meant to always be worth $1. It's not the first time Boden has warned about the dangers of the crypto space. She has previously sounded the alarm about the risk of consumers falling victim to fraud as a result of investments in crypto.""Customers are being scammed,"" the Starling chief said Tuesday. ""We're spending far more of our time protecting customers from the scammers than we are trying to promote crypto.""Asked whether Starling would ever offer crypto, Boden said it was unlikely to happen in the next couple of years, adding crypto companies have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to anti-money laundering controls.In April, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority published the findings of a review that found online-only challenger banks aren't doing enough to tackle financial crime. The regulator didn't name any names, but Starling confirmed it was among the firms whose systems were scrutinized, with a spokesperson saying the company has been ""extremely vocal"" about fighting fraud."
2022-06-08,"Ethereum wrapped up its first big dress rehearsal for a long-awaited makeover that's been repeatedly pushed back for the last several years.Developers told CNBC that the effort was quite smooth.Later this year, ethereum is expected to undergo an official transition from the energy-intensive proof-of-work method of securing the network to proof-of-stake. Ethereum just completed its first big dress rehearsal for a long-awaited makeover that will be its most significant overhaul since the digital currency was launched nearly a decade ago.Cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and bitcoin are often criticized for the process of mining to generate new coins. Both currently use a so-called proof-of-work mining model, involving complex math equations that massive numbers of machines race to solve.Ethereum has been working to shift from the energy-intensive proof-of-work method for securing the network to a proof-of-stake model, which requires users to leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens. This requires far less power than mining and will translate to faster transactions. The transition has been repeatedly pushed back for the last several years because of major flaws in the implementations.Developers told CNBC that the latest test run on Wednesday was very smooth, an important marker as the blockchain for the second-largest cryptocurrency gears up for its landmark move.Here's what happened. Ethereum's longest-lived test network (testnet, for short) simulated a process identical to what the main network (or mainnet) will execute this fall. Testnets allow developers to try out new things before they're rolled out on the main blockchain, giving them time to make necessary tweaks. Wednesday's exercise showed that the proof-of-stake validation process substantially reduces the energy necessary for verifying a block of transactions, and also proved that the merger process works.""There was no crazy bug that happened,"" said Auston Bunsen, co-founder of QuikNode, which provides blockchain infrastructure to developers and companies. ""Everything went as smooth as it could be.""Tim Beiko, the coordinator for ethereum's protocol developers, agreed and added that the network is now stable. However, he noted that the test hit ""some minor known issues,"" and developers ""will be spending the next few days triaging them before discussing next steps on this Friday's AllCoreDevs call."" The price of ether, the token native to the ethereum blockchain, has lost about half its value this year and is trading at just over $1,800. Since December 2020, the ethereum community has been testing out the proof-of-stake workflow on a chain called beacon. The beacon chain runs alongside the existing proof-of-work chain and already has human validators crunching new blocks.Beacon solves the problems that have arisen from prior efforts to make the switch, according to Beiko.""We knew that there would be a lot of technical work to address things like the increased centralization that we see in other proof-of-stake systems,"" Beiko told CNBC. ""We've achieved that with the beacon chain.""Beiko tells CNBC the original proposal required validators to have 1,500 ether, a stake now worth around $2.7 million, in order to use the system. To lower the barrier to entry, the new proof-of-stake proposal would require interested users to have only 32 ether, or about $57,600.

On Wednesday, ethereum's longest-running testnet, known as Ropsten (which closely mirrors the mainnet) successfully merged its proof-of-work execution layer with the proof-of-stake beacon chain. It was the first dry run of the process that the mainnet will undergo later this fall, should all go according to plan.Beiko said that testing the merge allowed developers to ensure that the software running the ethereum protocol was stable and ""that everything built on top of the network was ready for the transition.""Bunsen said that prior to Wednesday, the beacon chain wasn't actually doing much.""It was just chugging along, creating, for lack of a better term, empty blocks,"" he said.He called Wednesday's trial ""an instantaneous smooth rollout"" and said, ""I can see it happening in the same way for mainnet."" More dry runs are expected to happen on testnets called Goerli and Sepolia, giving developers additional opportunities to see what might go wrong before the official show.""At each testnet, we expect the code to be closer to what will be used on the ethereum mainnet,"" said Beiko. ""We're looking for less friction every time. Hopefully the minor issues we've seen today are resolved by the time we upgrade the next testnet.""Still, Beiko encourages enthusiasts to exercise caution.""Users should be aware that ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake requires no action on their part unless they are a validator on the network,"" he said. ""The transition also won't create any 'new' ethereum tokens.""Beiko encouraged users to watch out for scams and refer to ethereum's blog for announcements.WATCH: UST's crash has some investors reevaluating their crypto investments"

Erik Finman, who became a bitcoin millionaire by the time he was 18, is spending up to $20 million on Republican candidates running for Congress in the 2022 midterm elections.Finman, 23, said he wants to donate $10 million toward GOP candidates and political action committees, including Saving Arizona, a super PAC backing Trump-endorsed Arizona Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters. The committee has received at least $10 million from tech executive and Republican megadonor Peter Thiel, Federal Election Commission records show.Finman said he's sinking another $10 million into his new Washington D.C.-based nonprofit America's Future. The 501(c)(4) will finance what he called a ""midterms tour"" – a series of rallies across the country for conservative candidates. Finman's new organization will also promote his conservative ideals as well as a proposed regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, he said in an interview.Finman's foray into politics comes as the crypto industry evolves into a powerful lobbying force on Capitol Hill. More than $30 million so far has been poured into the campaigns from crypto leaders since the 2020 election cycle.Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, has been the primary financier behind the political action committee Protect Our Future, which has only backed Democrats running for office in the 2022 election cycle so far. Bankman-Fried gave another $10 million to the PAC in April, according to FEC records.Finman could give a similar boost to Republicans this cycle. He's donated tens of thousands of dollars in the past, but not millions. Election records show he gave more than $40,000 to candidates since the start of the 2020 election cycle.Like Bankman-Fried, Finman says he's met with lawmakers about crypto regulations and other policy matters, though he would not say who he's met.Finman's become more active in politics because he questions whether lawmakers really understand the laws they're writing and industries they oversee, he said.""I don't think a lot of these people are wise elders,"" Finman said, adding that some lawmakers are thoughtful and well informed, ""and those are golden people. But I don't know if that's the majority of people in D.C.""Finman's nonprofit, America's Future, is expected to launch in July and already has plans to host a rally for George Santos, a Republican running for Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi's open House seat in New York. Suozzi is giving up his position to try to unseat New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in the primary. Finman has separately given $5,800 to Santos' campaign this cycle, the maximum allowed in direct contributions to a candidate under campaign finance rules. Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball, an election tracker, marks the race for Suozzi's district as a toss-upThough Finman gave $2,800 to President Joe Biden's campaign during the 2020 election, he's become increasingly more conservative. He met with former President Donald Trump in February at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, and said he plans to support the twice-impeached president if he runs again in 2024.Finman also spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, earlier this year. The conference is organized by longtime Trump ally Matt Schlapp.A high school dropout, Finman said he attended a summit Thiel hosts for a fellowship program he runs that gives $100,000 over two years to participants who drop out of school to pursue business opportunities. Masters and Thiel worked together at Thiel's firm, Thiel Capital.He said he met Masters while participating in the program and then spoke with him again at a 2020 election night party hosted by Thiel at his home in Los Angeles. Finman says he encouraged Masters to run for Arizona's Senate seat and he has since given $5,800 to his campaign.Finman is surrounded by key Republican political advisors, including Garrett Ventry, who was chief of staff to Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., and a senior communications advisor to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. when the veteran lawmaker chaired the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.Finman also said he's in regular contact with David McIntosh, president of the conservative group Club for Growth.Correction: Finman took part in a summit Thiel hosts for tech entrepreneurs in his fellowship program, he wasn't a fellow himself."
2022-06-10,"Chief executives at 228 American companies co-signed a letter on Thursday urging members of the U.S. Senate to take ""bold, urgent action"" to pass legislation aimed at reducing gun violence in America.The CEOs who signed the letter represent companies both large and small across a wide range of industries, including some highly recognizable names:Consumer goods: Unilever United States, Levi Strauss & Co., Dick's Sporting Goods, Patagonia, Lululemon AthleticaFinance: Bain Capital, Credit Karma, Intuit, Kabbage, NerdWalletTech: Lyft, Bumble, DoorDash, Logitech, Poshmark, YelpMedia: Bloomberg, Conde Nast, YahooSports: Philadelphia Eagles, Cleveland Guardians, San Francisco Giants, San Francisco 49ersThe letter, posted to the website CEOsForGunSafety.org, points to recent gun violence tragedies at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and a Tops supermarket in Buffalo, New York, alongside the dozens of other mass shootings that have occurred in the U.S. — just since those massacres unfolded in May. ""Taken together, the gun violence epidemic represents a public health crisis that continues to devastate communities – especially Black and Brown communities – and harm our national economy,"" the letter reads. ""All of this points to a clear need for action: the Senate must take urgent action to pass bold gun safety legislation as soon as possible in order to avoid more death and injury.""The CEOs cite statistics compiled by gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety: more than 110 people are shot and killed in the U.S. each day, on average, while another 200 are shot and wounded. The letter also cites Everytown's estimate that the effects of gun violence, including costs associated with medical care and victims' lost earnings, cost the country more than $280 billion each year – with U.S. employers losing $1.4 million daily in productivity and revenue.The letter does not offer any specific policy solutions — although Levi Straus CEO Chip Bergh, one of the letter's key organizers, has previously expressed support for universal background checks on all gun purchases and national red flag gun laws. Rather, the letter calls on federal lawmakers to ""transcend partisanship and work together to pass bold legislation to address gun violence in our country.""On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a sweeping gun bill called the Protecting Our Kids Act, that would raise the federal minimum age for buying an assault rifle from 18 to 21, while also banning the sale of large-capacity magazines and implementing new rules around secure at-home gun storage.The bill passed on a mostly party line vote in the Democratic-held House. It's not expected to survive in the Senate, where Republicans can easily block the bill with a filibuster. A small group of Senators, led by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), are currently negotiating a potential bipartisan agreement on measures like background checks, red flag laws and funding for mental health and school safety initiatives.""We are not far away,"" Murphy told reporters after the group met on Thursday. ""But we are not there yet.""In 2019, CEOs for Gun Safety published a similar letter to Senate leaders, featuring the signatures of 145 executives, saying that ""doing nothing about America's gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable.""

2022-06-10,"The consumer price index rose 8.6% in May from a year ago, the highest increase since December 1981. Core inflation excluding food and energy rose 6%. Both were higher than expected.Surging food, gas and energy prices all contributed to the gain, with fuel oil up 106.7% over the past year.Shelter costs, which comprise about one-third of the CPI, rose at the fastest 12-month pace in 31 years.The rise in inflation meant workers lost more ground in May, with real wages declining 0.6% from April and 3% on a 12-month basis. Inflation accelerated further in May, with prices rising 8.6% from a year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.The consumer price index, a wide-ranging measure of goods and services prices, increased even more than the 8.3% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI was up 6%, slightly higher than the 5.9% estimate.On a monthly basis, headline CPI was up 1% while core rose 0.6%, compared with respective estimates of 0.7% and 0.5%.Surging shelter, gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase.Energy prices broadly rose 3.9% from a month ago, bringing the annual gain to 34.6%. Within the category, fuel oil posted a 16.9% monthly gain, pushing the 12-month surge to 106.7%.Shelter costs, which account for about a one-third weighting in the CPI, rose 0.6% for the month, the fastest one-month gain since March 2004.

Analysts say it can beat the market too Finally, food costs climbed another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.Those escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month. Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6% in April, even though average hourly earnings rose 0.3%, according to a separate BLS release. On a 12-month basis, real average hourly earnings were down 3%.Markets reacted negatively to the report, with stock futures indicating a sharply lower open on Wall Street and government bond yields rising.""It's hard to look at May's inflation data and not be disappointed,"" said Morning Consult's chief economist, John Leer. ""We're just not yet seeing any signs that we're in the clear.""Some of the biggest increases came in airfares (up 12.6% on the month), used cars and trucks (1.8%), and dairy products (2.9%). The vehicle costs had been considered a bellwether of the inflation surge and had been falling for the past three months, so the increase is a potentially ominous sign, as used vehicle prices are now up 16.1% over the past year. New vehicle prices rose 1% in May.Friday's numbers dented hopes that inflation may have peaked and adds to fears that the U.S. economy is nearing a recession.The inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices. May's report likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest rate increases ahead.""Obviously, nothing is good in this report,"" said Julian Brigden, president of MI2 Partners, a global macroeconomic research firm. ""There is nothing in there that's going to give the Fed any cheer. ... I struggle to see how the Fed can back off.""With 75 basis points of interest rate rises already under its belt, markets widely expect the Fed to continue tightening policy through the year and possibly into 2023. The central bank's benchmark short-term borrowing rate is currently anchored around 0.75% -1% and is expected to rise to 2.75%-3% by the end of the year, according to CME Group estimates.Inflation has been a political headache for the White House and President Joe Biden.Administration officials pin most of the blame for the surge on supply chain issues related to the Covid pandemic, imbalances created by outsized demand for goods over services and the Russian attack on Ukraine.In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden said he will push for further improvements to supply chains and continue efforts to bring down the budget deficit.However, he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen both have emphasized that much of the responsibility for lowering inflation belongs to the Fed. The administration has largely denied that the trillions of dollars directed toward Covid aid played a major role.How much the central bank will have to raise rates remains to be seen. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently released a white paper with a team of other economists that suggests the Fed will need to go further than many are anticipating. The paper asserts that the current inflation predicament is closer to the 1980s situation than it appears because of differences in the ways that CPI is computed then and now.Correction: Julian Brigden is president of MI2 Partners.

2022-06-11,"Last month, Amazon hosted more than a dozen Instagram, TikTok and YouTube stars at a glitzy Mexico resort.Attendees could stroll through a curated pop-up shop of ""internet famous"" items for sale on Amazon, visit the ""Kindle Beach Oasis"" and hang out at a Prime Video movie night. The company is trying to entice social media creators to join its influencer program, which launched in 2017. For three days in May, more than a dozen stars of Instagram, YouTube and TikTok convened in the coastal town of Todos Santos, Mexico, where they were treated to sunset dinners and spa sessions.It's the type of luxurious weekend that internet influencers have come to expect from the growing number of companies trying to capitalize of their online fame. But the event on Mexico's Pacific Coast wasn't run by one of the powerhouses of social media. It was hosted by Amazon.The online retailing giant took over the opulent Paradero and rebranded it as ""Amazon Resort."" The outing was for members of Amazon's influencer program, which was launched five years ago and allows creators to earn money by recommending the company's products on their social media accounts. Amazon held prior events this year in New York and Los Angeles.Amazon is dipping its toe into the influencer marketing industry, which has skyrocketed from a roughly $1.7 billion market in 2016 to an estimated $13.8 billion in 2021, according to a study by the Influencer Marketing Hub. It's expected to grow to $16.4 billion this year, which reflects the amount of money companies are spending on the increasingly popular marketing channel.Influencers are seen as key tastemakers, who can help companies unlock access to a specific audience demographic, and they often have rabid and engaged fan bases. Many social media stars are now commanding lucrative endorsement deals from major brands. They also get wined, dined and otherwise pampered.In addition to the lavish meals and spa offerings at Amazon Resort, the host company held a workshop to help creators set up their own Amazon storefront, a dedicated page where they can post shoppable videos and selections of their favorite products to drive purchases and earn commissions.  Attendees could also stroll through a curated pop-up shop of ""internet famous"" items for sale on Amazon, visit the ""Kindle Beach Oasis"" and hang out at a Prime Video movie night. Raye Boyce was one of the attendees. She's been part of Amazon's influencer program for almost a year, and said she joined the program after regularly hosting makeup tutorials on Amazon Live, the company's livestreaming service, which has provided her with some additional income. Boyce, who boasts more than a million followers on her YouTube and Instagram accounts, has turned what was a hobby a decade ago into a full-time gig.""Now there's Amazon, which is a way of making commissions from products you would normally buy on your own,"" Boyce said. ""You can make money off of that on top of your brand deals, and YouTube and TikTok and everything else.""Amazon isn't the first company to jet social media influencers off to lavish excursions. In recent years, as social media creators have proved their value, brands are inviting them on paid getaways, typically to promote their latest products and post content that can go viral and persuade other influencers to join the party. For Amazon, influencers serve as unofficial marketers of its online store, the company's largest source of revenue. Influencers have to apply to join the program, and Amazon considers metrics such as the number of followers they have before admitting them.""Creators today really are decentralized media companies,"" said Ryan Detert, CEO of influencer marketing start-up Influential. ""These channels that exist on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, you name it. They can drive traffic to wherever they want their audience to go."" Amazon pays out a commission to influencers any time a customer buys an item that it recommended. Payouts vary depending on the product type, but influencers stand to earn the most if they promote titles from Amazon Games and luxury beauty items, which earn commissions of 20% and 10%, respectively. Influencers weren't required to push out content while they were at the Mexico event, Amazon said. But plenty of them did, including creator Kirsten Titus, who posted a vlog on YouTube chronicling her experience.""They've got a whole setup here,"" Titus said in the video, as she walked onto a beach where free cocktails were available along with access to cabanas and surf lessons on boards branded ""Amazon Resort.""Meredith Silver, Amazon's director of creative growth, told CNBC that the events ""facilitate a sense of community among our creators, to educate and inspire them, and thank them for being part of our program.""Gracey Ryback is a frequent Amazon Live streamer and has been part of Amazon's influencer program for two years. She said her monthly earnings from the program amount to the ""low five figures.""Ryback said she started on TikTok, posting content under the user name ""DealCheats."" Most of her videos were focused on shopping, and helping users find ""dupes,"" or cheap knockoff products that they can buy on Amazon. ""I started to become the personal shopper of TikTok,"" Ryback said.As her following grew, Ryback realized she needed to diversify onto other platforms. She joined Amazon's influencer program and began hosting live streams five days a week that last an hour or two each.On a recent stream, Ryback promoted products including an Apple Watch knockoff, an LED face mask light and a Shiatsu foot massager. Each stream takes hours of preparation, and Amazon has a long list of guidelines for creators to follow.""It's a whole production,"" Ryback said. ""Usually, afterwards I'm sweating, and my house looks like a warehouse because I have all these products strewn around.""WATCH: Company promises to clone your pets"
2022-06-11,"Millions of people received aid through three rounds of federal checks after the onset of Covid-19.The rush to get payments out quickly meant sometimes sacrificing accuracy.A look back at whether the money really helped everyone who needed it most, and if it is a factor in today's high inflation. When the U.S. began to shut down the wake of the onset of Covid-19, it meant millions of families were suddenly without the income they needed.Within weeks, Congress passed a massive emergency aid package aimed at providing relief. In that legislation were ""economic impact payment"" checks amounting to up to $1,200 per eligible adult.There have been a total of three rounds of such checks — including additional payments of up to $600 and $1,400 per person in 2021 — referred to as ""stimulus checks"" by many Americans.While the government had deployed stimulus checks before — particularly in the wake of the Financial Crisis — the size and scope of the direct checks was in many ways a new experiment.More from Personal Finance:Annuity sales buoyed by market fears, higher interest ratesHow to use a 529 college savings plan if student debt's forgivenHere's how to fight a higher-than-expected property tax bill""The three of them together were massively bigger than what the government had done before,"" said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.With each stimulus check, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury became faster and more efficient at deploying the money.In the initial few weeks of the first stimulus check program in 2020, the IRS deployed 89.5 million payments.When a third stimulus check was approved by Congress on March 11, 2021, the IRS announced on March 17 it had already disbursed about 90 million payments.  ""Overall, the IRS gets credit,"" Gleckman said. ""They just did an extraordinary job in getting these checks out in very difficult circumstances.""To be sure, there were glitches along the way, including some initial checks that were sent to deceased Americans.Experts also say the money could have been more targeted, as some well-to-do taxpayers who were unaffected financially by the pandemic also received money.""There was a trade-off between speed and accuracy,"" said Erica York, senior economist and research manager at the Tax Foundation. ""The payments were not as targeted as they could have been if lawmakers had other options,"" York said. ""A higher priority for lawmakers was getting relief out fast because of the nature of the pandemic.""About 90% of taxpayers received money regardless of whether they were experiencing financial hardship, she said.The third $1,400 checks phased out more quickly in an effort to limit how much people with higher incomes received.As the payments were deployed, there was a drop in the number of households actually spending them, according to York. While the first checks were mostly devoted to household spending, the later checks were more typically used for saving or paying down debt – a trend seen across all income levels.  One issue that persisted throughout the deployment of the stimulus checks, and then again with monthly child tax credit payments, was reaching non-tax filers who do not typically submit returns because their incomes are too low.In January 2021, President Joe Biden issued an executive order to renew government efforts to find the estimated 8 million people who were still without checks.While the number may have been reduced with additional outreach, it is possible some people may have still fallen through the cracks. ""It was really, really difficult to get money into the hands of the most vulnerable, people that are transient or unbanked or folks with little to no internet access, particularly in rural areas,"" said Dorian Warren, co-president of Community Change, a national organization focused on helping low-income Americans, particularly people of color.""There was just no easy way for them to get the money,"" he said.Moreover, those people may have hesitated to sign up for payments, due to the complexity of the forms or fear and shame associated with the IRS, Warren said. For much of 2020, Capitol Hill lawmakers were at odds over whether to send additional payments. Former President Donald Trump advocated for a round of $2,000 checks. So did then President-elect Biden.But Washington leaders bargained down to $600 per person for the second round, which led to another legislative package with $1,400 payments to top those off after Biden was elected.Those last checks happened just as the economy was about to improve.""With the benefit of hindsight, you could say it was probably unnecessary,"" Gleckman said of the third round of checks. ""But I think at the time it was a reasonable call.""Now that the U.S. has record high inflation, some argue the stimulus money could have fueled those issues.  ""There's inflation across the board, and the U.S. is experiencing kind of a uniquely higher inflation,"" York said. ""I think it's driven by not just the stimulus payments themselves, but the size of the relief overall.""Yet Gleckman argues the surge in prices has been affected by supply rather than demand issues — and those problems aren't directly connected to the stimulus money.That includes constraints on factory workers due to the pandemic, problems with shipping from overseas and now the Russia-Ukraine war, which led to additional bottlenecks.""It's a little too convenient to blame inflation on excessive stimulus payments,"" Gleckman said. ""Not that they had nothing to do with this, but they don't have as much to do with this as some people would suggest."""
2022-06-11,"Apple is positioned to gain PC market share from Microsoft Windows after announcing MacBook laptops with the next-generation M2 chips.Adobe, Microsoft and other app developers have been making their software compatible with Apple silicon, giving companies more of an incentive to make the switch. Apple's new laptops announced on Monday, featuring the iPhone maker's next-generation in-house chips, might pose fresh challenges to Microsoft's lucrative Windows business.Since Apple started selling Macs powered by its homegrown M1 processors in late 2020, the company's computer business has been picking up momentum. Earlier this week, Apple introduced the M2, which will debut in the new MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro.related investing newsStanley Druckenmiller piles into these A.I. plays and other technology stocksYun Li21 hours agoLong-time Tesla bear sees more trouble ahead for EV maker after annual meetingSamantha Subin21 hours agoThe new chip will include 25% more transistors and 50% more bandwidth than M1.Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at technology industry research company Gartner, said Apple could continue picking up market share with the M2 architecture. In 2021, Apple held 7.9% of worldwide PC shipments by operating system, while Windows controlled 81.8%, according to Gartner's estimates. The firm expects Apple's share to move up to 10.7% in 2026 as Windows share slips to 80.5%.Kitagawa said an updated forecast that will likely make Apple's performance look stronger is coming in the next few weeks.Apple's Mac business has been revived by new devices sporting the company's own chips as a replacement for processors from Intel. The first was the MacBook Air released last year, followed by updated models of the iMac, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro laptop, and a new model for power users called Mac Studio.Apple's newer devices have longer battery lives than their older Intel-based counterparts and plenty of processing power.Sales have been surging. Apple's Mac business grew by 23% in fiscal 2021 to over $35 billion in sales. In the March quarter, Mac sales rose over 14%, a faster increase than any other Apple hardware category. Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts in April that ""the incredible customer response to our M1-powered Macs helped propel a 15% year-over-year increase in revenue despite supply constraints."" That isn't great news for Microsoft.Most of Microsoft's Windows revenue comes from licenses it sells to Dell, HP, Lenovo and other device makers. That amounts to 7.5% of Microsoft's total revenue and almost 11% of gross profit, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Keith Weiss wrote in a note this week.As Microsoft loses market share, ""a lot of pricing control is lost in the marketplace,"" said Brad Brooks, CEO of cybersecurity start-up Censys and formerly corporate vice president for Microsoft's Windows consumer business.Most revenue from Windows licenses to device makers comes from commercial customers. Brooks said Apple is making headway among consumers, and he learned during his nine years at Microsoft that there's a positive correlation between consumer use and what happens at work.""Once they start using a different product set in their home environments, they're more likely to adopt that environment in their professional settings,"" Brooks said, speaking of the corporate leaders who make technology buying decisions.Brooks said he switched to a Mac as his main computer in 2017, and said he'd like an M2 machine in the future. All of his company's roughly 150 employees use Macs as their primary computers, he said.Businesses were slow to adopt Apple's M1 computers because of concerns that key applications wouldn't be compatible. But Adobe, Microsoft and other developers have gradually come out with native versions of their software for the devices, said Kitagawa, who now expects corporate adoption to grow.Patrick Moorhead, CEO of industry research company Moor Insights and Strategy, said Windows PCs could eventually have battery life and performance that match Apple's latest Macs. Among chipmakers that they use, ""it's closer right now between Apple and AMD than it is between Apple and Intel,"" Moorhead said.Apple has other levers to pull, though, as it could offer cheaper computers. Moorhead envisions a MacBook SE that might cost $800 or $900, compared with the $1,199 starting price for Apple's upcoming M2 MacBook Air. It would be similar to what Apple has done with the iPhone SE, a budget iPhone that lacks some of the company's newest smartphone enhancements.""A MacBook SE at a much lower price point would disrupt Windows in a pretty big way,"" Moorhead said.Microsoft didn't respond to a request for comment.— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.WATCH: M2 chip, Apple's pay later service are most important announcement's from Apple's WWDC, says Goldman's Hall"
2022-06-13,"Even as cryptocurrency craters as it has the past few weeks, it remains an asset class that is accessible to anyone, says Cleve Mesidor, a blockchain educator.She says that is why it's drawing in Black and Latino communities.""The working class and middle class are already adopting this,"" Mesidor said. Even as cryptocurrency craters as it has the past few weeks, it remains an asset class that is accessible to anyone, says a blockchain educator. And Cleve Mesidor says that's why it's drawing in Black and Latino communities.Bitcoin's selloff, sparked by a reversal of the buying mania that drove it higher, has now become the third-deepest in the cryptocurrency's 13-year history. On Monday, bitcoin fell to as low as $22,611, according to CoinDesk. That is down more than 20% from Friday, and down 67% from its November high of $68,991. Despite the slide, Mesidor remains bullish.She was working in the Obama administration in 2013 when she first heard about bitcoin.From the beginning, the concept excited her. Within a few years, she'd leave politics and enter the cryptocurrency space with a mission to make the new financial world a better one for people of color and women than the traditional market of stocks, bonds and mutual funds.Most recently, Mesidor has published a book, The Clevolution: My Quest for Justice in Politics & Crypto, a memoir about her journey from growing up in Haiti to falling down the blockchain rabbit hole.She's the founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain and just became the executive director of The Blockchain Foundation, which seeks to educate different industries on the emerging technology.

Shortly after that conversation, bitcoin had a massive drop Monday, hitting $23,000 — its lowest level since December 2020.The exchange has been edited and condensed for clarity. Annie Nova: You had a career in politics before moving over to cryptocurrency. How does that prior experience inform the work you're doing now?Cleve Mesidor: When I left Washington, I moved back to New York, and got immersed in the New York City crypto ecosystem. When bitcoin hit $20,000, everybody lost their minds, and the IRS was like, 'Are these people paying their taxes?' The regulatory conversation really heated up, and so I started leaning back on my Washington background. I found there was a void: Policy was not keeping up with adoption. Since 2018, I started publishing a weekly newsletter that goes to my public policy network. AN: What do people get most wrong about cryptocurrency?CM: We know that about 25% of the U.S. owns cryptocurrencies of some kind, and Black and Latino communities are actually leading the adoption. It's not white males. The working class and middle class are already in.AN: Why are Black and Latino communities leading crypto adoption?CM: Your attraction to cryptocurrency depends on your relationship with money. If money in the traditional system has always worked for you, you'll be like, 'Why fix it?' 'Why actually take the risk of a new pathway?' But if traditional finance never worked for you, then the alternatives look attractive. In America, Black and Latino communities, regardless of whether you're unbanked or a professional like myself, you're treated the same. Banks don't care about you, wealth managers don't care about you and Wall Street doesn't care about you.AN: But what's different about cryptocurrency? I can see the same problems in traditional finance reemerging here.CM: What's different about cryptocurrency is decentralization. With every other traditional asset class, there are barriers to entry. This is the first asset class that is accessible to anyone. That is not the case for stocks or bonds or mutual funds. Also, Black and Latino communities do not see crypto as a risky investment; the riskiest place for us has been traditional finance. A few months ago, Ryan Coogler, the director of ""Black Panther,"" went into a bank to withdraw $10,000, and they called the police on him. AN: There's still a huge gender imbalance in the cryptocurrency space, with much fewer women than men involved. What do you think the main reason for this is?CM: Women are a fast-growing demographic in crypto, but the numbers are still abysmal. That's largely because women are often the heads of households and responsible for the livelihoods of their children and their parents, which impacts their tolerance for risk.AN: How do you get more women in?CM: We need to empower women and give them more information about crypto. By talking to people about things like 'fractionalization,' meaning you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin, we will get more women. And the value proposition can't just be about becoming an investor. We must also emphasize opportunities for entrepreneurship, innovative career paths with remote work options, the ability to make a social impact and also highlight resources and education about how to reduce risk.AN: What do you see as the future of cryptocurrency?CM: If we cut through the noise of cryptocurrency and blockchain, and a lot of it is noise, it's really about efficiency, optimizing processes and giving people more control — access to their own data. Blockchain and cryptocurrency will be powering our world, and we won't even notice it."

The firm has seen the value of its assets more than halve since October, when it handled $26 billion in client funds. Celsius' cel token has also erased 97% of its value in the same timeframe. Celsius is the biggest holder of cel, a token it encourages people to buy to earn rewards and get discounts on lending rates.""Acting in the interest of our community is our top priority,"" Celsius said in the memo.

Celsius has denied this.Just last week, the company said it had not had any issues meeting withdrawal requests. Celsius said it had the reserves and ""more than enough"" of the cryptocurrency ether, to meet obligations.In April, Celsius boss Alex Mashinsky told CNBC his company holds on average 300% collateral for each loan it offers to retail investors, while for institutional investors it issues undercollateralized loans.""We've been doing this for five years now, longer than anybody else,"" he said at the time. ""The business is doing very well.""Hours before announcing a freeze on account withdrawals, Mashinsky lashed out at a crypto investor raising concerns with Celsius.""Do you know even one person who has a problem withdrawing from Celsius?"" Mashinsky asked, before accusing the investor of spreading ""misinformation.""Crypto lending is still very much a regulatory gray area. U.S. market regulators believe many of the products should be treated as securities subject to strict rules to ensure investors are protected.In February, BlockFi, a competitor to Celsius, was hit with a $100 million penalty from the Securities and Exchange Commission and 32 states, which charged it with violating securities laws. Celsius itself was sent cease-and-desist letters from four U.S. states.Vijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, said Celsius' decision to pause withdrawals had exacerbated the sell-off in cryptocurrencies, which have already come under pressure due to concerns around rising inflation and higher interest rates.""The Luna/Terra debacle potentially has a lot of hidden skeletons in the closet, which we're now potentially seeing come out,"" Ayyar told CNBC.""The trust in these yield products is definitely impacted and we're probably going to see widespread regulation on such products in the near term.""Nexo, another crypto lending firm, said it sent Celsius a letter Sunday offering to acquire its collateralized loan portfolio, but the company declined.""As a sign of goodwill and in an attempt to support the digital asset ecosystem in these difficult times, yesterday we reached out to the Celsius team to offer our support, but our help was refused"" Antoni Trenchev, Nexo's CEO, told CNBC.""We firmly believe that much can be done to help Celsius' clients in various different ways.""Celsius' troubles have reignited worries over the risk of a broader market contagion from cryptocurrencies.

""While we tried our best to get this just right, in this case it is now clear to me that we over-hired.""The news comes during a deep rout for Coinbase shares. The stock went public via a direct listing last April during a boom in crypto markets and investors clamoring for high-growth tech stocks. Coinbase's shares are down 79% this year and 85% from the all-time high. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped to near $22,000 and has lost 53% of its value this year. San Francisco-based Coinbase reported a slump in users in its last quarter and a 27% decline in revenue from a year ago. The company gets the majority of its top line from transaction fees, which are closely tied to trading activity.President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi called it a ""very difficult decision for Coinbase"" but given the economic backdrop, she said it ""felt like the most prudent thing to do right now.""Affected employees received a notification from human resources. If so, the memo was sent to a personal email as Coinbase cut off access to the company systems.

Coinbase employees will have access to a talent hub to find new jobs in the industry, including Coinbase Ventures' portfolio companies. Choi said Coinbase would still be ""doubling down"" on areas like security and compliance and may be ""reorienting"" employees to near-term revenue drivers.""If there are any cuts to new product areas, it's going to be more around experimental venture areas that we're still very bullish on, but that we don't want to invest in in this part of the cycle,"" Choi told CNBC in an interview at the company's headquarters.""We will continue to invest in incredible innovative areas of crypto that we think are emerging over the longer term, but we're probably going to do those in a more measured way in this type of an environment.""

It's very much unclear if this document came from within the company,"" Choi said. ""However, if it did, we're disappointed that those behind it felt the need to breach the trust of the company and their co-workers by sharing this information in a way clearly designed to drive controversy rather than a meaningful dialogue."" Coinbase has no plans to offer additional company equity grants, or cash compensation amid the price drop, Choi said. The company offers annual grants, partially so employees could ""mitigate the swings"" and volatility in crypto. For employees and investors, the COO likened it to Amazon or Tesla: a long-term investment with volatility in the meantime.""We think that anyone who makes an investment, whether they're an employee or investor, will have a handsome return over the longer term,"" Choi said.

2022-06-17,"Environmental, social and corporate governance — or ESG — investments attracted record levels of new assets in 2021.But as markets slide, investors are divided over whether they are willing to sacrifice performance to prioritize their personal values, a recent survey finds.Many ESG investors also hold cryptocurrencies, which have also raised environmental concerns due to energy consumption. As the bull market flourished in 2021, many investors took a shine to investments that reflected their values.Environmental, social and corporate governance — or ESG — investments attracted record levels of new assets. Last year, U.S. sustainable funds attracted almost $70 billion in 2021, a 35% increase over the previous 2020 high, according to Morningstar.related investing newsAs Big Cap tech nears new highs and dominates indexes, some stress equal weightingBob Pisani11 hours agoYet despite record growth, ESG funds have not yet reached mass adoption, according to new research by Betterment. To find out who is and isn't investing in ESG and why, the firm recently commissioned an online survey of 1,000 investors who hold taxable investments. More than a quarter of respondents — 26% — said they currently own some kind of ESG-themed investment. Of those respondents, 59% have held those investments for more than a year.Notably, the survey also found 80% of investors who hold ESG-themed investments also have money in cryptocurrencies.ESG investors are more likely to belong to younger generations, with 54% of Gen Z and millennials holding these investments. That compares to 42% of boomers and 25% of Gen Xers. Many respondents — 46% — said they have not sought ESG investments, but are interested in them.Meanwhile, a majority of those who were not interested — 51% — said they do not feel they understand ESG investments well enough. Another 27% are concerned their returns may suffer if they invest in this area. Most survey respondents do not own crypto, 63%, versus 37% who said they do.Meanwhile, 80% of those who hold ESG-themed investments also hold crypto investments. In comparison, just 22% of those without ESG-themed investments in their portfolio hold crypto.Yet as cryptocurrencies gain adoption, that has led some to raise red flags about the energy consumption from their mining activity. Bitcoin mining alone has been estimated to consume more electricity than many countries, according to Betterment's report. Because electricity is connected to fossil fuels, the energy used to mine crypto may potentially drive up greenhouse gas emissions.More from Personal Finance:Cost to finance a new car hits a record $656 per monthHow to get started building credit as a young adultHere's what the Fed's interest rate hike means for youThe survey found 96% of ESG investors who are also invested in crypto are aware of those environmental concerns, while just half of non-ESG investors said the same.Moreover, 76% of respondents said it was either very important or important for major cryptocurrencies to become more environmentally friendly.""The industry itself is moving in a sustainable direction, in part because of all of the scrutiny and all of the investor sentiment around this,"" said Raoul Bhavnani, chief communications officer at Betterment, citing Ethereum's recent switch to a less energy intensive method to generate new coins. As markets drop, just how well investors perceive ESG funds as helping them reach their goals may be a factor as to whether they can sustain their recent growth.When Betterment asked how willing survey respondents would be to sacrifice performance to achieve their ESG goals, 17% said they were very willing, 16% said they were willing and 25% said they were somewhat willing. Meanwhile, 26% said they were not very willing and 16% said they were not willing at all.The top hesitations investors cited with investing in ESG-based portfolios included whether it would reduce their returns, with 53%, followed by the impact the investment would have, 40%, or if it would have higher fees than other funds, 39%.Separately, a recent Morning Consult survey found Americans are generally split on ESG and profitability. While 40% of investors surveyed indicated they prioritize profitability over social responsibility, 37% of respondents said the opposite."
2022-06-17,"Companies are showing concerns of a recession, and in the crypto space, many are preparing for a crypto winter.Coinbase is laying off 18% of its workforce, or roughly 1,100 people, according to an email sent to employees Tuesday morning. CEO Brian Armstrong said the company grew ""too quickly"" during a bull market and expressed concerns of a looming recession.""We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,"" Armstrong said in the email. ""While it's hard to predict the economy or the markets, we always plan for the worst so we can operate the business through any environment.""Here's why businesses are preparing for a crypto winter, and what that means for investors. People have been speculating for a few months about the possibility of a crypto winter, which refers to when crypto prices fall and stay low for an extended period of time.Bitcoin has dropped around 55% year-to-date and sits at around $21,000 per coin. It's down about 70% from an all-time high of $69,000 per coin in November. The overall market capitalization of crypto assets dropped to less than $1 trillion from its peak of $3 trillion in November.The most recent crypto winter happened in late 2017 and early 2018, when bitcoin crashed as much as 80% from all-time highs and took about 18 months to recover. Meanwhile, stocks officially entered bear market territory this week, with the S&P 500 index down around 23% since the beginning of the year as of Friday afternoon. Experts are predicting a recession could be around the corner.It's hard to say how the current swing will shake out, says William Luther, an economics professor at Florida Atlantic University and director of the American Institute for Economic Research's Sound Money Project.He says it's important to keep the long view: If you think these are valuable assets, then you believe their use will be more prevalent in the future and ""you see this as more of a seasonal swing. That's why folks call it a crypto winter, because it suggests that there is a spring on the horizon.""""Judging by past experience, there have tended to be these ebbs and flows in the in the crypto market,"" he tells CNBC Make It. Businesses are worried that with crypto assets dropping in price, investors will decrease their trading activity, which is how firms make money.That means companies have to find ways to reduce costs, like by reducing their workforce. Coinbase joins a growing list of crypto companies, including BlockFi and Crypto.com, that recently announced hiring freezes and then staff cuts in order to reduce costs.For most businesses, current swings in the market are still relatively small, ""so you don't see most companies in the economy laying off 20% of their workers when there's a market decline,"" Luther says.With cryptocurrencies, though, ""there's the potential for their value to fluctuate a lot more than other assets, and so you see companies adjacent to those coins expanding and contracting much more."" Luther says the good news is that current crypto volatility shouldn't change your broader portfolio strategy. ""You should have a strategy in place where you have a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds and potentially crypto assets as well, where you've thought carefully about that asset allocation.""Other than rebalancing your portfolio if the value of your assets has changed, ""I don't see anything that's happened in the last in the last six months that would cause me to change my portfolio strategy,"" Luther says.Experts typically advise crypto remain a small part of your total portfolio, between 1% and 5%, and that you only put in as much money as you're comfortable losing.However, for those interested in geting into crypto, now isn't the best time, Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management, recently told CNBC. He made one exception for people with very long-time horizons and who are dollar-cost averaging into the asset.Those buying in now should have ""long-term conviction,"" Tyrone Ross, CEO and co-founder of Turnqey Labs, Inc. previously told CNBC. He said buying into crypto now has a similar risk and potential reward of venture-backed investing.If anything, Luther sees the current crypto swings as a reminder of what he tells his students: Be cautious of owning too much stock in their employer, especially if they work in a volatile industry.He knows it's a tough sell to people building the technology: ""They're very excited about it, and they naturally want to own a piece of the assets that they're creating. ""But they should at the very least recognize that's a very risky proposition, when they could be diversifying away some of that risk by by holding a more traditional portfolio.""Check out:Stocks have officially entered bear market territory—here’s what that means and what you should doYou shouldn’t look at your investment accounts every day—here’s whyTech experts call for Congress to bring 'skeptical approach' to crypto industrySign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"
2022-06-17,"The FBI says investment fraudsters pose a ""significant threat"" to LinkedIn.Users around the country tell CNBC they lost small fortunes after connecting with someone on LinkedIn who they believed was giving them sound financial advice.The company acknowledges a recent increase in fraud and says it removed 32 million fake accounts last year. SAN FRANCISCO — Fraudsters who exploit LinkedIn to lure users into cryptocurrency investment schemes pose a ""significant threat"" to the platform and consumers, according to Sean Ragan, the FBI's special agent in charge of the San Francisco and Sacramento, California, field offices.""It's a significant threat,"" Ragan said in an exclusive interview. ""This type of fraudulent activity is significant, and there are many potential victims, and there are many past and current victims."" The scheme works like this: A fraudster posing as a professional creates a fake profile and reaches out to a LinkedIn user. The scammer starts with small talk over LinkedIn messaging, and eventually offers to help the victim make money through a crypto investment. Victims interviewed by CNBC say since LinkedIn is a trusted platform for business networking, they tend to believe the investments are legitimate.Typically, the fraudster directs the user to a legitimate investment platform for crypto, but after gaining their trust over several months, tells them to move the investment to a site controlled by the fraudster. The funds are then drained from the account.""So the criminals, that's how they make money, that's what they focus their time and attention on,"" Ragan said. ""And they are always thinking about different ways to victimize people, victimize companies. And they spend their time doing their homework, defining their goals and their strategies, and their tools and tactics that they use.""Ragan said the FBI has seen an increase in this particular investment fraud, which is different from a long-running scam in which the criminal pretends to show a romantic interest in the subject to persuade them to part with their money. The FBI confirmed it has active investigations but could not comment since they are open cases.In a statement, LinkedIn acknowledged there has been a recent uptick of fraud on its platform, telling CNBC that ""we enforce our policies, which are very clear: fraudulent activity, including financial scams, are not allowed on LinkedIn. We work every day to keep our members safe, and this includes investing in automated and manual defenses to detect and address fake accounts, false information, and suspected fraud.""""We work with peer companies and government agencies from across the world with the goal of keeping LinkedIn members safe from bad actors. If a member encounters or is the victim of a scam we ask that they report it to us and to local law enforcement.""LinkedIn's senior director of trust, privacy and equity, Oscar Rodriguez, said, ""trying to identify what is fake and what is not fake is incredibly difficult.""""One of the things that I would really love for us to do more is get into proactive education for members,"" Rodriguez said. ""Letting members know or basically allowing them to understand the risks that they might face.""The company says it removed more than 32 million fake accounts from its platform in 2021, according to its semiannual report on fraud. From July to December 2021, its automated defenses stopped 96% of all fake accounts — that includes 11.9 million that were stopped at registration and 4.4 million that were proactively restricted, the report said. Members reported 127,000 fake profiles that were also removed.LinkedIn said its automated defenses caught 99.1% of spam and scams, a total of 70.8 million, in that same time period. Another 179,000 were removed after members reported them. LinkedIn said it doesn't provide estimates on how much money has been stolen from members through its platform.The company cautioned users in a Thursday night blog post on its platform against sending money to people they don't know and responding to accounts with a questionable work history or other red flags, such as poor grammar. That's little comfort to Mei Mei Soe, a Florida benefits manager who says she lost $288,000 — her entire life savings — to a scammer on LinkedIn. It started out innocently enough with someone whose profile said he was a manager at a Los Angeles fitness company seeking to connect with her last December. They began chatting first over LinkedIn and then on a messaging app, and she said she was intrigued by his offer to help her make money. ""He asked me if I'm on LinkedIn for professional networking or if I'm looking for a job,"" Soe said. ""I never trust anybody, but we began talking and over time he gained my trust.""Soe said when the conversation eventually turned to investing, ""he showed me how he's profiting from his investments and told me I should start investing with crypto.com which I know is a legitimate website. I started with $400.""The fraudster convinced her to move her investments to a site he controlled. Over several months, Soe would make a total of nine transactions, which included bank loans and money borrowed from friends, hoping to use her earnings to start a small business. But Soe would soon learn that the connection she made on LinkedIn wasn't who he said he was. In the end, she lost all of her funds.""I still remember the day,"" Soe said. ""Once I realized I had been scammed, I tried to contact him but couldn't find him anywhere. I work hard, and every single dollar I save, I work hard to save that. It hurts.""She said she never thought she would get scammed on LinkedIn.Crypto.com said it immediately takes down accounts that it finds are linked to a scam.""We take a proactive approach to managing and protecting against external threats, including scam and phishing campaigns,"" it said in a statement to CNBC. ""As with all financial transactions, fiat or crypto, it is critical to ensure the account receiving funds is legitimate and its owner is identified and trustworthy prior to the transfer.""Soe's story is not unique. A group of victims defrauded on LinkedIn which meets regularly over Zoom recently invited a CNBC reporter to join the session, as long as the participants' faces were concealed and their names not revealed. Their losses ranged from $200,000 to $1.6 million.""We just never thought there could be such malicious intent behind a LinkedIn profile,"" one victim who lost $350,000 said.""The fraudsters hide behind successful companies,"" another victim who lost $200,000 said. ""One of the biggest reasons I accepted the invite was the person stated on their profile that they worked for a legitimate company.""""We've lost a lot of money,"" a victim who lost $700,000 said. ""And it's not just all of our savings, people have lost their houses and their car loans. It's life destroying and soul crushing.""Ragan said he understands the victims' pain, but they should not blame themselves.""It's not their fault that they were victimized,"" Ragan said. ""It's the perpetrator's fault. It's the criminal's fault. They spend their nights and days thinking about ways to victimize and defraud people. That's how they make their money through illicit gains. And the people that fall victim to it, they're victims.""The Global Anti-Scam Organization, a victim advocacy and support group, has traced the majority of the perpetrators to Southeast Asia.""They usually target victims on LinkedIn by showing that they have some entrepreneurial spirit,"" Grace Yuen, Global Anti-Scam Organization spokesperson, said. ""They may claim they graduated from a well-known university, then they say they're in finance or in investment. Sometimes they even pretend to be in the same industry as you."""
2022-06-18,"Economists and bankers tell CNBC they aren't worried about the crypto sell-off hurting the broader U.S. economy.""People don't really use crypto as collateral for real-world debts. Without that, this is just a lot of paper losses. So this is low on the list of issues for the economy,"" said Joshua Gans, an economist at the University of Toronto. Carnage in the crypto market won't let up, as token prices plummet, companies lay off employees in waves, and some of the most popular names in the industry go belly up. The chaos has spooked investors, erasing more than $2 trillion in value in a matter of months — and wiping out the life savings of retail traders who bet big on crypto projects billed as safe investments.The sudden drop in wealth has stoked fears that the crypto crash might help trigger a broader recession.The crypto market's sub $1 trillion market cap (which is less than half that of Apple's) is tiny compared to the country's $21 trillion GDP or $43 trillion housing market. But U.S. households own one-third of the global crypto market, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs, and a Pew Research Center survey also found that 16% of U.S. adults said they had invested in, traded, or used a cryptocurrency. So there is some degree of national exposure to the deep-sell off in the crypto market.Then there's the whole mystique around the nascent crypto sector. It may be among the smaller asset classes, but the buzzy industry commands a lot of attention in popular culture, with ads on major sporting championships and stadium sponsorships.That said, economists and bankers tell CNBC they aren't worried about a knock-on effect from crypto to the broader U.S. economy for one big reason: Crypto is not tied to debt.""People don't really use crypto as collateral for real-world debts. Without that, this is just a lot of paper losses. So this is low on the list of issues for the economy,"" said Joshua Gans, an economist at the University of Toronto.Gans says that's a big part of why the crypto market is still more of a ""side show"" for the economy. The relationship between cryptocurrencies and debt is key.For most traditional asset classes, their value is expected to stay moderately stable over some period of time. That is why those owned assets can then be used as collateral to borrow money.""What you haven't seen with crypto assets, simply because of their volatility, is that same process by which you're able to use it to buy other real world assets or more traditional financial assets and borrow off that basis,"" explained Gans.

The spillover risks from tanking crypto prices to the broader fiat U.S. dollar banking system, therefore, ""may be limited.""For all the enthusiasm for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, venture capitalist and celebrity investor Kevin O'Leary points out that most digital asset holdings are not institutional.Gans agrees, telling CNBC that he doubts banks are all that exposed to the crypto sell-off.""There's certainly been banks and other financial institutions, which have expressed interest in crypto as an asset and as an asset that they might like their customers to also be able to invest in, but in reality, there isn't that much of that investment going on,"" explained Gans, noting that banks have their own set of regulations and their own need to make sure that things are appropriate investments.""I don't think we've seen the sort of exposure to that that we've seen in other financial crises,"" he said. Experts tell CNBC that the exposure of everyday mom and pop investors in the U.S. isn't all that high. Even though some retail traders have been battered by the recent stretch of liquidations, overall losses in the crypto market are small relative to the $150 trillion net worth of U.S. households.According to a note from Goldman Sachs in May, crypto holdings comprise only 0.3% of household worth in the U.S., compared with 33% tied up in equities. The firm expects the drag on aggregate spending from the recent price declines to ""be very small.""O'Leary, who has said that 20% of his portfolio is in crypto, also makes the point that these losses are spread out worldwide.""The great news about the crypto economy and even positions like bitcoin or ethereum, these are decentralized holdings. It's not just the American investor exposed,"" he said. ""If bitcoin went down another 20%, it wouldn't really matter because it's spread around everywhere.""""And it's only $880 billion before the correction, which is a big nothing burger,"" continued O'Leary.By way of comparison, BlackRock has $10 trillion in assets under management, and the market value of the four most valuable tech companies — even after this year's correction — is still over $5 trillion. Some analysts on Wall Street even believe the fallout of failed crypto projects are a good thing for the sector overall — a sort of stress test to wash out the obvious business model flaws.""The collapse of weaker business models such as TerraUSD and Luna is likely healthy for the long term health of this sector,"" said Alkesh Shah, global crypto and digital asset strategist at Bank of America.Shah says the weakness in the crypto and digital assets sector is part of the broader risk asset correction. Rather than driving the economy down, crypto prices are tracking tech equities lower, as both succumb to pressure from greater macroeconomic forces, including spiraling inflation and a seemingly endless succession of Fed rate hikes.""Higher than expected rate hikes coupled with recession risk has broadly hit risk assets including software and crypto/digital assets. With central banks globally tightening, my strategy colleagues expect central banks to take about $3 trillion of liquidity from markets globally,"" continued Shah.Mati Greenspan, the CEO of crypto research and investment firm Quantum Economics, blames the Fed's tightening as well.""Central banks were very quick to print gobs of money when it wasn't needed, which led to excessive risk taking and reckless build up of leverage in the system. Now that they're withdrawing the liquidity, the entire world is feeling the pinch."""

The world's two most popular cryptocurrencies are down more than 35% in the past week, as both breach symbolic price barriers.Bitcoin bounced back to around $18,955 and ether was trading at about $995 just after 8 p.m. ET.The carnage in the crypto market is partly caused by pressure from macroeconomic forces, including spiraling inflation and a succession of Fed rate hikes. We have also seen these blue chip cryptos track equities lower. It doesn't help that crypto firms are laying off large swaths of employees, and some of the most popular names in the industry are facing solvency meltdowns.Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 in November. Ether peaked at $4,891.70 that same month. Bitcoin last traded this low around December 2020.Here's how we got here. The week started with crypto prices plummeting, and bitcoin falling as much as 17% at one point in the day. It seemed like the crypto winter was here.In the chaos, Celsius, a major crypto staking and lending firm, shocked the market when it announced that all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts have been paused due to ""extreme market conditions."" In a memo addressed to the Celsius Community, the platform also said the move was designed to ""stabilize liquidity and operations.""Celsius effectively locked up its $12 billion in crypto assets under management, raising concerns about the platform's solvency. The news rippled across the crypto industry, reminding some of what happened in May, when a failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project lost $60 billion in value and dragged the wider crypto industry down with it.Celsius was known for offering users a yield of up to 18.63% on their deposits. It's like a product a bank would offer, except with none of the regulatory safeguards.Those crazy high yields were what eventually came under scrutiny.""This risk certainly seems like it's just the beginning,"" said John Todaro, Needham's vice president of crypto assets and blockchain research.""What I would say is on the decentralized side — a lot of these DeFi protocols, a lot of those positions are over collateralized, so you shouldn't quite see the underfunding situation that could happen with centralized borrowers and lenders. But that being said, you could still see a lot of liquidations with that collateral being sold off on DeFi protocols,"" continued Todaro. Crypto markets appeared to stabilize on Tuesday, with bitcoin hovering at around $22,000 and ether at around $1,100.Investors were assessing the fallout of Celsius, and meanwhile, another crypto firm joined a growing list of companies cutting staff to try to shore up profits.Coinbase announced it was laying off nearly a fifth of its workforce due to crypto volatility. The company had previously cut spending and even rescinded job offers in the hopes of stabilizing its business.""We had the recent inflation report that came out that I think surprised many folks,"" explained President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi.""We've had Jamie Dimon and others talk about an upcoming economic hurricane and so given what's happening in the economy, it feels like the most prudent thing to do right now,"" continued Choi.Crypto companies across the board are looking for ways to cut costs, as investors rotate out of the riskiest assets, pulling down trading volumes.Crypto.com recently announced a staff reduction of 260 people, as did Gemini, which said it would lay off 10% of its workforce — a first for the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange and custodian.  MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor appeared on CNBC Wednesday morning to discuss concerns around his firm, which has made a $4 billion bet on bitcoin. Saylor has said the company doubles as the first and only bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S., so investing in MicroStrategy is the closest you'll get to a bitcoin spot ETF.MicroStrategy has used company debt to purchase bitcoin, and in March, Saylor decided to take another step toward normalizing bitcoin-backed finance when he borrowed $205 million using his bitcoin as collateral — to then buy more of the cryptocurrency.""We have $5 billion in collateral. We borrowed $200 million. So I'm not telling people to go out and take a highly leveraged loan. What I am doing, I think, is doing my best to lead the way and to normalize the bitcoin-backed financing industry,"" said Saylor, who added that publicly traded crypto miner Marathon Digital also took out a credit line with Silvergate Bank.As bitcoin prices tanked this week, investors worried the company would be asked to put up more collateral for its loan, but Saylor said the fears were overblown.""The margin call is much ado about nothing,"" Saylor told CNBC earlier this week. ""It's just made me Twitter famous, so I appreciate that...We feel like we have a fortress balance sheet, we're comfortable, and the margin loan is well managed.""Then on Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point in its most aggressive hike since 1994. The Fed said the move was made in an effort to curb sky-high inflation.Crypto prices initially rallied on the news as investors hoped we could avoid a recession, but that rally was short-lived. We were back in the red on Thursday. Bitcoin fell to around $20,000, to prices it hadn't seen since the end of 2020.The losses were closely tied to a sell-off on Wall Street, in which the Dow fell 700 points to its lowest level in more than a year.It appears that investors can't shake the fears of recession, and some say it could take time for cryptocurrencies to recover from the sell-off in riskier assets.""I think that we're in a long drawdown period here,"" Jill Gunter, Espresso Systems co-founder & chief strategy officer, told CNBC's Squawk on the Street.""I think that we've taken the elevator down, and I think that we, as an industry, are going to have to take the stairs back up and climb out by building real utility,"" she said.Gunter said that, in many ways, what we're seeing is a ""healthy washout.""""One doesn't want to, as a builder, as an investor for the long-term... be in a market where it's being driven by just short-term price action, by speculation, as, let's be honest, the crypto market has been largely over the last couple of years,"" continued Gunter. Carnage in the crypto markets shows no signs of slowing down, as bitcoin and ether continue their sell-off at a rapid clip on Saturday afternoon.This comes as crypto hedge funds and businesses face growing questions about insolvency.""We had financial instability because of this opaque leverage, you just couldn't tell where all these risks were building up,"" Paxos CEO & Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla told CNBC.""In some ways, this is just an age old story. You're borrowing short and lending long. And I think it's really unfortunate that people lost money, and I think it will, in some ways, set back the space, because you will lose some early adopters or some of the people who just came in new to the space,"" continued Cascarilla.But Cascarilla also says that investors are still looking for quality crypto investments.""The fundamental technology here and the adoption curve that we see, the institutions that are coming in, how you can get your financial system to operate at the speed of the internet, those are things that need to happen,"" he said.

2022-06-20,"Over the weekend, bitcoin had fallen as low as $17,601.58.The cryptocurrency market has been hit by a number of factors, ranging from the collapse of stablecoin terraUSD to questions of solvency at crypto lender Celsius.Macroeconomic factors including high inflation and upcoming rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve are also weighing on the market. Bitcoin jumped on Monday, after the cryptocurrency fell below its 2017 high over the weekend, but investors remained on edge thanks to a slew of negative crypto headlines and macro factors keeping pressure on sentiment.The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap climbed above the $20,000 mark for much of the day Monday. However, it last edged lower by less than 1% to $20,005.46, according to Coin Metrics. Over the weekend, bitcoin fell as low as $17,601.58. Meanwhile, ether inched higher by less than 1% to $1,102.86.While investors will welcome the rebound, bitcoin still sits 70% below its all-time high, hit in November. It's down 57% year-to-date. Many have suggested a market bottom could be close, but with so much economic uncertainty remaining, bitcoin still has more downside potential, according to Yuya Hasegawa, a crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank.""Bitcoin's weekend dip was, to put it simply, not deep enough,"" he said. ""The macro environment has not really changed from last week's FOMC meeting: there still has not been a clear sign of inflation coming down and the Fed may still drive the economy into recession by raising rates too aggressively or simply by failing to tame inflation."" With bitcoin unable to hold convincingly above $20,000, industry watchers said the rally might be short-lived.Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC that unless the price of bitcoin closes above $23,000 on a daily time frame basis, ""the odds are this is a dead cat bounce.""""We're oversold, so a bounce was expected,"" he added. The broader cryptocurrency market has been plagued by a number of issues in recent weeks, beginning with the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and associated token luna.Attention has now turned to crypto lending companies that promise users high yields for depositing their digital coins. Last week, Celsius, a company with 1.7 million customers and nearly $12 billion of crypto assets under management, paused withdrawal of funds for customers, sparking concerns that it is insolvent.Cryptocurrency companies have announced rounds of layoffs amid the market downturn. Coinbase, a crypto wallet and exchange, said last week it will cut 18% of full-time jobs. A lending firm called BlockFi said last week it will lay off a fifth of its staff.Macroeconomic factors including high inflation and upcoming rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve are also weighing on the market.""When inflation is on the doorstep and with rate hikes in the offing, the risks of a recession round the bend are high,"" Charles Hayter, CEO of CryptoCompare, told CNBC via email.""The push me pull you of higher rates sapping cash from mortgaged house owners means people are psychologically bracing and paring back and digital assets are suffering thus.""""Coupled with this, the pull back in the digital asset ecosystem has uncovered a number of systemic issues."" Given the big fall in cryptocurrency prices in the last few weeks, some observers said that a bottom to the market could be close.Giles Keating, director of Bitcoin Suisse, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday that ""we're close to a point where some of the real excess leverage has now been driven out of the system and a bottom can begin to be formed.""Leverage refers to trading in which investors effectively use borrowed money to make trades. That means investors can get larger exposure to positions with less initial capital. But that's seen as a risky means of trading as it requires investors to ensure they have enough capital to meet the so-called margin requirements. If they don't, their position is automatically liquidated. Those liquidations are seen as a big factor behind market moves.Keating said there is still a risk of further liquidation, but he thinks the majority of the selling is over.""Now some people are warning that we are still not yet there and that if we were to break significantly lower, that we'd see another wave of liquidations,"" Keating said.""There's always that risk hovering there. But my feeling, given I think those very very big double digit rebounds we saw, in bitcoin, particularly in ether, I think to my mind that was a sign that a lot of those really big liquidations are now done and that the base really is being formed."""

Decentralized finance platforms are going to extreme lengths to limit the fallout from a sell-off in cryptocurrencies.Solend, a lending platform built on the Solana blockchain, tried to gain control of its largest account, a so-called ""whale"" investor that it said could significantly influence market movements. Solend's users have since voted to block the move. Solend is a DeFi app that lets users borrow and lend funds without having to go through intermediaries.Solend said a single whale is sitting on an ""extremely large margin position,"" potentially putting the protocol and its users at risk. ""In the worst case, Solend could end up with bad debt,"" the firm said. ""This could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network.""The account concerned had deposited 5.7 million sol tokens into Solend, accounting for more than 95% of deposits. Against that, it was borrowing $108 million in the stablecoins USDC and ether. If sol's price sank below $22.30, 20% of the account's collateral — about $21 million — is at risk of being liquidated, Solend said. Sol was trading at a price of $34.49 on Monday.On Sunday, Solend passed a proposal granting it emergency powers to take over the whale account, an unprecedented move in the DeFi world.Solend said the measure would allow it to liquidate the whale's assets via ""over-the-counter"" transactions — as opposed to on-exchanges trades — to avoid a possible cascade of liquidations. The move led to a backlash on Twitter, with some questioning Solend's decentralization. One of DeFi's core tenets is that it's meant to do away with centralized institutions like banks.By Monday, however, Solend's users were asked to vote on a new proposal to overturn the earlier vote. The community overwhelming voted in favor, with 99.8% voting ""yes.""The debacle is a sign of how DeFi — a kind of ""Wild West"" where users take it on themselves to conduct trades and loans peer-to-peer — has gotten caught up in the crypto meltdown.MakerDAO, the creator of a dollar-pegged stablecoin called DAI, recently disabled a feature that allowed traders to borrow DAI against staked ether, a derivative token causing mayhem in the crypto market.StETH is meant to be worth the same as ether, but it's been trading at a widening discount to the second-biggest cryptocurrency. Moving in and out of stETH isn't easy, and that's resulted in liquidity issues at large crypto lenders and hedge funds like Celsius and Three Arrows Capital."

It's being formally announced later on Tuesday during a keynote that MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright is giving at Radio City Music Hall as part of this week's NFT.NYC conference in New York City.The platform and its underlying technology present a big opportunity for legacy brands like Universal and Fox that are sitting on decades of intellectual property.NFTs are digital assets that represent real-world objects — such as art, music and real estate — and can't be replicated. In the past few months, big brands from every industry, including Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Nike, Gucci and the National Football League, have brought NFTs into their marketing initiatives.""The potential of NFTs goes beyond collecting; it's the utility. You can essentially program anything into these NFTs over time, which is why we decided to focus on this new product offering,"" Soto-Wright told CNBC.

""The macro environment has not really changed from last week's [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting: There still has not been a clear sign of inflation coming down and the Fed may still drive the economy into recession by raising rates too aggressively or simply by failing to tame inflation.""Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said bitcoin faces resistance at the $21,300 level. If the cryptocurrency can overcome that, he said, it could reach the next target of $23,500 as its short sellers get squeezed. A ""short squeeze"" happens when the price of a heavily shorted asset starts increasing, and short sellers are forced to purchase more of the asset to cover their positions."

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday said bitcoin could experience a rally over the next few months, though it could be years before it reaches its old highs.""The charts, as interpreted by Tom DeMark, suggest that bitcoin could have a nice relief rally over the next few months, even if he doesn't see it revisiting its old highs for years or even decades,"" he said.""I can't countenance buying crypto here, but if you still own some and you want out, I'm betting that from this, if you're another dip down, you might get a better price to get out,"" he added.The cryptocurrency market has had a rough year as investors spooked by inflation and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have sold off their assets, leading the crypto market to downturn. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has fallen far from its highs reached last November, with some predicting it will plunge even further.According to the ""Mad Money"" host, DeMark has a 13-step buy and sell countdown that helps him identify tops and bottoms in bitcoin. A certain number of sessions go in the same direction and eventually the buying or selling exhausts itself, he said.  In his breakdown of DeMark's analysis, Cramer examined the daily chart of Bitcoin from April of last year through today. Here's the chart: Cramer said that a notable aspect of the chart is that bitcoin never had a downside retracement of more than 50% on a closing basis since 2020 – until a few months ago.""According to DeMark, when you get a decline this ugly … it often does structural damage to the asset in question,"" he said. ""If you're thinking long-term, DeMark says that it could take many years for bitcoin to come near its old highs, maybe even decades. It's possible we'll never see them again,"" he added.However, that doesn't mean bitcoin can't bounce, according to Cramer.For more analysis, watch the video of Cramer's full explanation below.

2022-06-22,"FTX, Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange, agreed to provide crypto lender BlockFi with a $250 million revolving credit facility.Alameda, Bankman-Fried's quantitative trading firm, committed $500 million in financing to Voyager Digital, a crypto brokerage.Bankman-Fried has emerged as something of a savior for the $900 billion crypto market as it faces a deepening liquidity crunch. With no central bank willing to come to the rescue, beleaguered crypto companies are turning to their peers for help.Billionaire crypto boss Sam Bankman-Fried's companies has signed deals to bail out two firms in as many weeks: BlockFi, a quasi-bank, and Voyager Digital, a digital asset brokerage.FTX, Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange, agreed Tuesday to provide BlockFi with a $250 million revolving credit facility. Bankman-Fried said the financing would help BlockFi ""navigate the market from a position of strength."" ""We take our duty seriously to protect the digital asset ecosystem and its customers,"" he tweeted.It comes after BlockFi said earlier this month that it would lay off 20% of its staff. Meanwhile, a report from The Block said earlier this month that BlockFi was in talks to raise funds in a deal valuing the firm at $1 billion, down from $3 billion last year.Zac Prince, BlockFi co-founder and CEO, said the deal with FTX was more than just a round of debt, adding it ""also unlocks future collaboration and innovation"" between the two firms.Last week, Voyager Digital said Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's quantitative research firm, would provide it with $500 million in financing.The deal consists of a $200 million credit line of cash and USDC stablecoins, as well as a separate 15,000-bitcoin revolving facility worth approximately $300 million at current prices.A plunge in the value of digital currencies in recent weeks has resulted in numerous key players in the space facing financial difficulty.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are falling hard as the market grapples with the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and the $60 billion collapse of terraUSD, a so-called stablecoin, and its sister token luna.

The firm, which takes users' crypto and lends it out to make higher returns, is thought to have hundreds of millions of dollars tied up in an illiquid token derivative called stETH.Elsewhere, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has been forced to liquidate leveraged bets on various tokens, according to the Financial Times.On Wednesday, Voyager revealed the extent of the damage inflicted by 3AC's troubles.The company said it was set to take a loss of $660 million on loans issued to 3AC if the company fails to pay. 3AC had borrowed 15,250 bitcoins — worth around $310 million as of Wednesday — and $350 million in USDC stablecoins.3AC requested an initial repayment of $25 million in USDC by June 24 and full repayment of the entire balance of USDC and bitcoin by June 27, Voyager said, adding that neither amount has yet been repaid.The firm said it intends to recover the funds from 3AC and is in talks with its advisors ""regarding the legal remedies available.""""The Company is unable to assess at this point the amount it will be able to recover from 3AC,"" Voyager said.Voyager shares cratered on the news, falling as much as 60% on Wednesday.Zhu Su, 3AC's co-founder, previously said his company is considering asset sales and a rescue by another firm to avoid collapse. 3AC did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Bankman-Fried is one of the wealthiest people in crypto, with an estimated net worth of $20.5 billion, according to Forbes. His crypto exchange FTX notched a $32 billion valuation at the start of 2022.The 30-year-old has emerged as something of a savior for the $900 billion crypto market as it faces a deepening liquidity crunch. In an interview with NPR, Bankman-Fried said he feels his exchange has a ""responsibility to seriously consider stepping in, even if it is at a loss to ourselves, to stem contagion.""His actions highlight how a lack of regulation for the crypto industry means that firms can't turn to the federal government for a bailout when things turn south — a sharp contrast with the banking industry in 2008."
2022-06-22,"USDD, a so-called ""algorithmic"" stablecoin that's meant to always be worth $1, plunged as low as 93 cents on Sunday.The situation has led to fears that USDD may suffer the same fate as terraUSD, a similar token that collapsed in May.But despite concerns over a repeat of the Terra saga, experts say this is unlikely to be the case. A controversial stablecoin launched just before the collapse of a similar token called terraUSD is struggling to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar.USDD, a so-called ""algorithmic"" stablecoin that's meant to always be worth $1, plunged to as low as 93 cents on Sunday. The coin's creator has amassed a reserve of bitcoin and other digital tokens worth close to $2 billion to provide a buffer in case investors flee en masse.The situation has led to fears that USDD may suffer the same fate as terraUSD, or UST, the wrecked so-called stablecoin that formed part of an experiment called Terra. UST's meltdown triggered a wider sell-off in cryptocurrencies, which has been exacerbated in recent weeks by a growing liquidity crisis in the market.The Tron DAO Reserve, which oversees and manages the stablecoin, said a certain degree of volatility in USDD's price was to be expected given its ""decentralized"" nature.""Certain % of volatility is unavoidable,"" the organization tweeted last week. ""Currently, the market volatility rate is within +- 3%, an acceptable range. We will watch the market very closely and act accordingly.""USDD was trading at around 97 cents on Wednesday.Despite concerns over a repeat of the Terra saga, experts say this is unlikely to be the case, since USDD is much smaller in size and has seen little uptake from crypto investors. USDD was launched in early May, days before UST began tumbling below $1. For the past week, it has consistently traded below its intended dollar peg amid increased selling.Instead of sitting on piles of cash and other cash-like assets, USDD runs a complex algorithm — combined with a related token called tron — to maintain a one-to-one peg to the greenback. If that sounds familiar, it's because Terra's UST operated in much the same way, creating and destroying units of UST and a sister coin called luna to get around the need to have reserves to back the stablecoin.Another similarity USDD shares with UST is that it has accumulated a sizable cache of other digital tokens to help boost its price in case investors withdraw in droves. Terra bought billions of dollars worth of crypto in an effort to keep its stablecoin afloat, a move that ultimately proved futile.USDD's use of crypto as reserves expose it to ""similar risks as UST,"" said Monsur Hussain, senior director of financial institutions at Fitch Ratings.""Cryptos are generally price-correlated during times of upheaval,"" he added. USDD also offers investors unusually high interest rates — up to 39% — on their USDD deposits. Anchor, a crypto lending platform, similarly touted yields of as much as 20% on UST holdings, a rate many investors now say was unsustainable.The coin was created by Justin Sun, the outspoken crypto entrepreneur behind Tron, a blockchain that's trying to compete with Ethereum. Like Do Kwon, the founder of Terra, Sun has often used Twitter to promote his projects — and challenge critics.The Chinese-born businessman has been involved in numerous controversies and publicity stunts in the past. In 2019, he paid $4.6 million to have lunch with Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, only to then cancel abruptly. The lunch eventually took place in 2020. Upon closer inspection, though, it's clear there are some notable differences between USDD and UST.For one, USDD is nowhere near the scale of Terra, whose UST and luna tokens reached a combined value of $60 billion at their height. It would therefore be unlikely to have the same effect if it collapsed, according to analysts.""USDD doesn't have the weight to cause the same wake of destruction UST did,"" said Dustin Teander, a research analyst at crypto data firm Messari.

And unlike UST, which was only partially collateralized by crypto, USDD aims to be overcollateralized, meaning its assets always exceed the number of tokens in circulation.The Tron DAO Reserve says its reserve contains more than $1.9 billion in bitcoin and other tokens, including the stablecoins USDC and tether. USDD has a supply of roughly $700 million. That reduces the chance of a Terra-style collapse, according to Teander."
2022-06-23,"Joynese Speller was excited to start a new job as a project delivery specialist for a health care company on June 6.As she wrapped up at her old nonprofit job on a Friday, she emailed her new company to confirm her start time on Monday. Hours later, she got another email: The company had some logistics to work out on their end, so Speller would actually start on Tuesday. That slid into Wednesday, and then Thursday.On Friday, Speller got a phone call. Due to budget cuts, the job she hadn't even started yet was being eliminated.""I was told they were trying to find me a position in a different department, but it's also the end of their fiscal year, so they're taking a long time to get back to me,"" Speller, 26, of Charlotte, North Carolina, tells CNBC Make It. ""I left one job thinking I was going to another, so I wasn't financially prepared for what was coming.""Going back to her old workplace, which she says was ""toxic"" and had high turnover, wasn't an option — but she needed to pay for a car repair and care for her 4-year-old son. She's been doing Doordash deliveries to make ends meet for the past three weeks.After taking a few days to process her rescinded job offer, Speller fired up LinkedIn to apply for jobs and saw more news of major companies doing layoffs and taking back offers. ""I didn't realize it was so prevalent until it happened to me,"" she says. The most recent Labor Department data shows that the U.S. labor market is still tight, and workers have more bargaining power than ever. Job openings and quitting rates have shot up in the last year while unemployment ticked downward. As of April, there were roughly two job openings for every worker who wanted one.But over the past few weeks, many employers started scrambling to tighten their budgets due to rising inflation, rumblings of a looming recession and swings in the crypto market. Tech giants like Uber and Meta said they'd scale back hiring, while others including Robinhood, Peloton and Carvana conducted layoffs.Weeks after announcing its own hiring freeze, crypto exchange Coinbase laid off 18% of its workforce and began pulling job offers. Other companies including Twitter and Redfin have rescinded offers in recent weeks. Most of these high-profile staffing cuts are from hyper-growth tech companies focused on nixing early-career jobs, says Sid Upadhyay, co-founder and CEO of the recruiting company WizeHire. There could also be trouble brewing for other employers tied closely to economic conditions, like in mortgage and financial sectors.But the whiplash going from rapid hiring to rescinding offers, due to dramatic market swings, is ""highly unusual,"" Upadhyay says. ""The broader economic environment has shifted so much: Tech companies were incentivized to grow at all costs, and in a matter of weeks, we've moved into a world where we're focused on resiliency."" Marquelle Turner-Gilchrist, 35, of Los Angeles thought he'd found a ""match made in professional heaven"" when he found an opening with a social commerce company in April. He hit it off with the team over interviews and dinner, and a few days later, an offer landed in his inbox.Turner-Gilchrist took the weekend to think it over. On Monday, he emailed back with a few questions on the job details, and then ""I didn't hear from the co-founder for a few days, which was weird, because communication until then was great,"" he says.A few days later, Turner-Gilchrist got a call from the CEO, who rescinded the job offer — explaining that the company was largely funded by crypto investors whose digital assets were losing value by the day. ""We're revisiting what's happening in crypto market which has taken an unfortunate turn, and as a result, we don't believe it's a good idea to bring on additional headcount at this time,"" Turner-Gilchrist recalls the CEO telling him.""I've heard of offers being rescinded,"" Turner-Gilchrist says, noting that background checks or professional references sometimes don't pass muster. ""But it's never happened to me [before].""To an extent, he considers himself lucky: ""I could have been laid off in three months, and that'd be worse,"" he says. If anything, the experience taught him to be more cautious in interviews. He says he's more inclined to ask about a company's retention rates, thinks news of rescinded offers or recent layoffs should be noted on hiring boards, and believes senior leaders should be more publicly forthcoming about the financial health of their organization.""I'm not looking at crypto-adjacent companies at all,"" he adds. Jennifer Bell, 27, was set to start a operations manager job with Walmart in Louisville, Kentucky, but within days of accepting the offer, got a call the role was being eliminated. ""It's almost unbelievable,"" she says. ""I had a day to be upset, and then the next day I started applying to jobs left and right.""A Walmart spokesperson said the company isn't currently eliminating open positions or rescinding job offers, and declined CNBC Make It's request to further comment on personnel matters. Despite the experience, Bell says she's still in touch with the hiring manager at Walmart — and would take another position with the company, if offered, calling it ""recession-proof.""""I'm hopeful, knowing it's the type of company that has been stable for decades,"" she says. Still, she adds, getting back into the job hunt is emotionally challenging: ""It's hard to work through and tell yourself every day, 'Hey, it's not you,' when you know it's not your worth or confidence or background.""By contrast, Bell says she wouldn't return to her prior employer even if asked. In May, Bell was one of 2,500 people laid off from Carvana. She says some people were escorted off the premises, while others at home were laid off over a Zoom call.""If Carvana ever reached back out and wanted to bring me on, I don't care what amount of money they'd offer me. I would say 'no,'"" Bell says. ""That trust is betrayed.""Bell may still have that latitude to turn down job offers: She says she's taking lots of interviews these days, including for an HR manager job she says she's excited about. Upadhyay confirms that it's still a job-seeker's market across most sectors, and economists say the demand for tech workers remains so high that anyone laid off in that industry will likely be snatched up quickly by recruiters.Upadhyay urges candidates to remember: A rescinded job offer is a reflection of a business figuring out its balance sheet, not the job-seeker's skills or abilities.""Broadly speaking, we're seeing rescinded offers in a minority of cases,"" Upadhyay says. ""There are still hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the market, and most organizations extending offers are resilient and profitable companies.""Check out:This 27-year-old engineer quit her job to open her 'dream' bookstore—her best career advice3 questions to ask yourself to find your passion at workWhat people get wrong about America's burnout problem, according to this therapist and podcast hostSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"

And I never did it again,"" he said in a recent interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia."" Margin investing involves borrowing money from a broker to buy stocks or other assets.

Hundreds of workers from start-ups in Southeast Asia have been fired in the last few months, proving that the fast-growing industry is not immune to the global economic slowdown.At least six tech companies have let go of their staff, including Sea Limited, the owner of Singapore-based e-commerce site Shopee.Tech investors say this is just the beginning of more job cuts in the region's tech industry. As interest rates rise and economic uncertainty looms, companies are now being forced to focus on profitability instead of growing as quickly as possible.""Last year, a lot of what happened was a lot of cheap capital in the market flooded the market [which] allowed companies to grow really at any cost,"" said Jessica Huang Pouleur, a partner at venture capital firm Openspace. ""What happened was people hired very rapidly. You have a problem, you just throw people at it.""""I think we'll likely see more of it to come over the course of the next few months,"" Huang Pouleur said, referring to more layoffs in the tech space. Shopee has laid off workers from its food delivery and payment arms, as well as teams from Argentina, Chile and Mexico, according to an email from Chief Executive Chris Feng, which was sent to employees affected by the job cuts.""Given elevated uncertainty in the broader economy, we believe that it is prudent to make certain difficult but important adjustments to enhance our operational efficiency and focus our resources,"" according to the email, which was seen by CNBC. NYSE-listed Sea Limited — which had 67,300 employees as of end-2021 — did not say how many employees were affected. The company did not respond to CNBC's request for comments.Singapore-based digital wealth manager StashAway laid off 31 employees, or 14% of its headcount in end-May and June, according to a spokesperson.Malaysian online shopping platform iPrice retrenched one-fifth of its workforce in June.

Rising interest rates are a particular concern to the tech industry.""Increase in interest rate will increase the cost of doing business, and the cost of capital, and expectation of return [for investors],"" said Jefrey Joe, the managing partner of venture capital firm Alpha JWC. A higher interest rate will lower companies' profit margins, he added. ""Do we expect more layoffs? I think it's fair to say that yes.""As borrowing costs rise and the economy faces uncertainty, ""it would be odd not to see companies laying off,"" said James Tan, managing partner of venture capital firm Quest Ventures. ""Any start-up that does not do so will face a board that [questions] their underlying assumptions and ability to manage through a crisis."" Startups will need to prolong the cash runway by 18 to 36 months compared to the usual 12 to 18 months before they try to raise funds again, Tan said.As valuations have fallen from last year's high, companies will want to avoid raising money with the possibility of being valued lower than their last fundraising round. They would rather try to cut costs, and ride out this downturn before fundraising again, he added. If a storm is brewing, why are Southeast Asia-focused venture capital funds still able to raise large sums of money, and invest them?Preqin data showed that these funds have raised $900 million so far this year, the same amount raised in the whole of 2021. The ""exuberant climate"" for start-ups has recently turned, and the window for easy money is now closed, said Tan.Southeast Asia is still a fundamentally good region to bet on, investors said, pointing to its growing middle-class population, high internet usage rate, and growing number of repeat start-up founders — those who worked with other tech companies previously. Joe said the current downturn may be a good time for investors to pick out companies that are actually doing well and invest in them while their valuations are down.If investors start to deploy in the bear market, ""the outcome for that will be pretty good because we will exit in the next five to 10 years and ... hopefully the market should already recover,"" he said.""There's going to be an increasingly significant bifurcation between [good-]quality companies and [bad-]quality companies,"" Huang Pouleur said. ""With a lot of the weaker companies shedding a lot of good talent employees, it's going to allow the bigger, stronger companies to also hire better."""
2022-06-24,"Hackers have stolen $100 million in cryptocurrency from Horizon, a so-called blockchain bridge developed by crypto start-up Harmony.Bridges allow users to transfer tokens from one blockchain to another. They've become a prime target for hackers due to vulnerabilities in their underlying code.It follows a series of similar attacks on blockchain bridges, including the $600 million Ronin Network heist and the $320 million stolen from Wormhole. Hackers have stolen $100 million in cryptocurrency from Horizon, a so-called blockchain bridge, in the latest major heist in the world of decentralized finance.Details of the attack are still slim, but Harmony, the developers behind Horizon, said they identified the theft Wednesday morning. Harmony singled out an individual account it believes to be the culprit.related investing newsIt’s been a month since the big Shapella upgrade. Here’s how Ethereum has changed since thenTanaya Macheela day ago""We have begun working with national authorities and forensic specialists to identify the culprit and retrieve the stolen funds,"" the start-up said in a tweet late Wednesday.In a follow-up tweet, Harmony said it's working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and multiple cybersecurity firms to investigate the attack.Blockchain bridges play a big role in the DeFi space, offering users a way of transferring their assets from one blockchain to another. In Horizon's case, users can send tokens from the Ethereum network to Binance Smart Chain. Harmony said the attack did not affect a separate bridge for bitcoin.Like other facets of DeFi, which aims to rebuild traditional financial services like loans and investments on the blockchain, bridges have become a prime target for hackers due to vulnerabilities in their underlying code.Bridges ""maintain large stores of liquidity,"" making them a ""tempting target for hackers,"" according to Jess Symington, research lead at blockchain analysis firm Elliptic.""In order for individuals to use bridges to move their funds, assets are locked on one blockchain and unlocked, or minted, on another,"" Symington said. ""As a result, these services hold large volumes of cryptoassets.""Harmony has not revealed exactly how the funds were stolen. However, one investor had raised concerns about the security of its Horizon bridge as far back as April.The security of the Horizon bridge hinged on a ""multisig"" wallet that required only two signatures to initiate transactions. Some researchers speculate the breach was the result of a ""private key compromise,"" where hackers obtained the password, or passwords, required to gain access to a crypto wallet.Harmony was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.It follows a series of notable attacks on other blockchain bridges. The Ronin Network, which supports crypto game Axie Infinity, lost more than $600 million in a security breach that took place in March. Wormhole, another popular bridge, lost over $320 million in a separate hack a month earlier.The heist adds to a stream of negative news in crypto lately. Crypto lenders Celsius and Babel Finance put a freeze on withdrawals after a sharp drop in the value of their assets resulted in a liquidity crunch. Meanwhile, beleaguered crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital could be set to default on a $660 million loan from brokerage firm Voyager Digital."
2022-06-24,"When Jackson Aw was introduced to blockchain technology in 2018, he ""didn't get it at all.""""Can someone dumb it down even further for me? Like, can you just tell me what I can get as a consumer?"" That was four years ago. Today, Aw, seems to have the answer to that question. The 32-year-old Singaporean, who runs Mighty Jaxx — a multi-million dollar toy company that produces collectibles and lifestyle products — has incorporated blockchain into his products. A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records every transaction that has taken place. It also cannot be tampered with or changed retroactively. CNBC Make It finds out why it ""makes sense"" for the collectibles empire to tap into blockchain capabilities, and bet on the metaverse. Mighty Jaxx, which was founded in 2012, has partnered with some of the biggest global brands and visual artists, producing trendy collectibles that incorporate pop culture and design. Aw said the company has since sold millions of toy collectibles to people in more than 80 countries.Mighty Jaxx's limited-edition collectibles can cost up to $1,200 on its website, but in the secondary marketplace they can fetch ""five to ten times"" more than its original value, said Aw. But there is one problem.""When you want to sell the product, the number one question everywhere is 'Is it authentic?'""Aw added: ""For collectibles, what [sellers] do is that they take photos of the figurine and post it on Facebook groups, asking people to do an authenticity check.""However, Aw was not satisfied with this method of authentication. ""Whose word is it on? Where's the provenance of it? So we thought, okay, that's what we need."" Mighty Jaxx designed a near-field communication chip and embedded one into each toy.

2022-06-25,"Nine months in, El Salvador's nationwide bitcoin experiment is struggling.The government's bitcoin investment has been cut in half, bitcoin adoption nationwide isn't really taking off, and the country needs a lot of cash, fast, to meet its upcoming debt payments of more than $1 billion in the next year. El Salvador bet its economic salvation on bitcoin, but so far the gamble isn't paying off like President Nayib Bukele hoped it would.The government's crypto coffers have been cut in half, bitcoin adoption nationwide isn't really taking off, and crucially, the country needs a lot of cash, fast, to meet its debt payments of more than $1 billion in the next year. This comes as the price of bitcoin has fallen more than 70% from its November 2021 peak, and more than 55% from the time Bukele announced his plan.Meanwhile, El Salvador's economic growth has plummeted, its deficit remains high, and the country's debt-to-GDP ratio — a key metric used to compare what a country owes to what it generates — is set to hit nearly 87% this year, stoking fears that El Salvador isn't equipped to settle its loan obligations.Pair these economic woes with a renewed war on gang violence, and you have all the fixings of a country on the brink.""On the surface, the whole bitcoin thing hasn't really paid off,"" said Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst.It isn't bitcoin's fault that the government is edging toward financial ruin.The government has an unrealized paper loss on bitcoin of around $50 million, which the finance minister notes is less than 0.5% of the national budget. In aggregate, the entire experiment (and all its associated costs) have only run the government around $374 million, according to estimates. That's not nothing — especially considering the fact that El Salvador has $7.7 billion of bonds outstanding — but to an economy of $29 billion, it is comparatively small.The optics aren't good, though.Negotiations have stalled with international lenders in part because they are unwilling to throw money at a country that is spending millions in tax dollars on a cryptocurrency whose price is prone to extreme volatility. Rating agencies, including Fitch, have knocked down El Salvador's credit score citing the uncertainty of the country's financial future, given the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. That means that it's now even more expensive for President Bukele to borrow much-needed cash.""In terms of their financial situation, El Salvador is in a very difficult place. They have a lot of bonds that are trading severely discounted,"" continued Sobrado.""The economic policy of the country is essentially magical thinking,"" said Frank Muci, a policy fellow at the London School of Economics, who has experience advising governments in Latin America.""They've spooked the bejesus out of financial markets and the IMF,"" continued Muci, who tells CNBC that nobody wants to lend money to Bukele unless it's at ""eye-gouging rates"" of 20% to 25%.""The country is sleepwalking into a debt default,"" said Muci.But the millennial, tech-savvy president, who once touted himself as the ""world's coolest dictator"" on his Twitter bio, has tethered his political fate to this crypto gamble, so there is a very big incentive to make it work in the long run — and to pay off the country's debt in the interim. Bukele faces re-election for another five-year presidential term in 2024. Well before President Bukele got it in his head that bitcoin was a magical elixir that would bandage over longstanding economic vulnerabilities, the country was in a lot of trouble.The World Bank projects that the Salvadoran economy will grow by 2.9% this year and 1.9% in 2023, down from 10.7% in 2021. But that growth itself was a bounceback from an 8.6% contraction in 2020.Its debt-to-GDP ratio is almost 90%, and its debt is expensive at around 5% per year versus 1.5% in the U.S. The country also has a massive deficit — with no plans to reduce it, whether through tax hikes or by substantially cutting spending.In a research note from JPMorgan, analysts warn that El Salvador's Eurobonds have entered ""distressed territory"" in the last year, and S&P Global data reportedly shows that the cost to insure against a sovereign debt default is hitting multi-year highs.Both JPMorgan and the International Monetary Fund warn the country is on an unsustainable path, with gross financing needs set to surpass 15% of GDP from 2022 forward — and public debt on track to hit 96% of GDP by 2026 under current policies.""In the past three, four months, what they've done is implement gasoline subsidies, which are super expensive,"" said Muci, who has expertise in economic diversification and public financial management, and has taken part in applied research projects for El Salvador, Venezuela, and Honduras.""This is a country that's rudderless in terms of economic policy. I mean, they don't know where they're going, or what they're doing. I think it's a classic case of one day at a time,"" he said.All this comes as El Salvador faces imminent debt repayment deadlines in the billions of dollars, including an $800 million Eurobond that matures in January.El Salvador has been trying since early 2021 to secure a $1.3 billion dollar loan from the IMF — an effort that appears to have soured over President Bukele's refusal to heed the organization's advice to ditch bitcoin as legal tender. This tracks with Fitch's recent downgrade, which was also attributed to El Salvador's ""uncertain access to multilateral funding and external market financing given high borrowing costs,"" plus its ""limited scope for additional local market financing.""The president's efforts to consolidate power have also driven up this risk premium. Bukele's New Ideas party has control over the country's Legislative Assembly. In 2021, the new assembly came under fire after it ousted the attorney general and top judges. The move prompted the U.S. Agency for International Development to pull aid from El Salvador's national police and a public information institute, instead re-routing funds to civil society groups.Additionally, El Salvador can't print cash to shore up its finances. El Salvador dollarized in 2001, meaning that it ditched its local currency, the colón, in favor of the U.S. dollar. Only the Federal Reserve can print more dollars. Meanwhile, its other national currency, bitcoin, is revered for the fact that it, too, is impossible to mint out of thin air. In Sept. 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.The initiative involved buying bitcoin with public funds, as well as launching a national virtual wallet called ""chivo"" (Salvadoran slang for ""cool"") that offers no-fee transactions and allows for quick cross-border payments. For a country that is a largely cash economy — where roughly 70% of people do not have bank accounts, credit cards, or other traditional financial services — chivo was meant to offer a convenient onramp for those who had never been a part of the banking system.The experiment also involved building a nationwide infrastructure of bitcoin ATMs across the country and requiring all businesses to accept the cryptocurrency.The president upped the ante in November when he announced plans to build a ""Bitcoin City"" next-door to the Conchagua volcano in south eastern El Salvador. The bitcoin-funded city would offer significant tax relief, and geothermal energy rolling off the adjacent volcano would power bitcoin miners.All in, the government has spent about $375 million on the bitcoin rollout, including a $150 million trust designed to convert bitcoin instantly into dollars, $120 million on the $30 bitcoin bonus given to each citizen who downloaded the chivo wallet (no small sum in a country where the monthly minimum wage is $365), and the roughly $104 million the government has publicly admitted to spending on bitcoin. Muci notes that these expenses plus the $50 million in unrealized losses on the country's bitcoin portfolio means that the country has spent around $425 million on ""making bitcoin happen.""But nine months in to this nationwide bet on bitcoin, and it doesn't appear to immediately be delivering on a lot of its big promises.President Bukele tweeted in January that the app had 4 million users (out of a total population of 6.5 million), but a report published in April by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research showed that only 20% of those who downloaded the wallet continued to use it after spending the $30 bonus. The research was based upon a ""nationally representative survey"" involving 1,800 households.​​""In terms of actual penetration of bitcoin transactions, it seems to be quite low,"" explained Sobrado. ""There seem to have been issues with regards to the state-issued wallets. Lots of people downloaded it, but it was buggy. It wasn't really the best user experience.""Of those who did use the government's crypto wallet, some had technical problems with the app. Other Salvadorans reported cases of identity theft, in which hackers used their national ID number to open a chivo e-wallet, in order to claim the free $30 worth of bitcoin offered by the government as an incentive to join.Another hope for the chivo wallet was that it would help save hundreds of millions of dollars in remittance fees. Remittances, or the money sent home by migrants, account for more than 20% of El Salvador's gross domestic product, and some households receive over 60% of their income from this source alone. Incumbent services can charge 10% or more in fees for those international transfers, which can sometimes take days to arrive and require a physical pick-up.But in 2022, recent data shows that only 1.6% of remittances were sent via digital wallets.In terms of merchant adoption, a survey published in March by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of El Salvador found that 86% of businesses have never made a sale in bitcoin.""They gave people the wallets, they forced businesses to accept them, but essentially, in my opinion, it's a big nothing burger,"" said Muci, who previously worked at the Growth Lab at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. ""Nobody really uses the app to pay in bitcoin. People that do use it, mostly use it for dollars.""Bitcoin City is on hold, as is the $1 billion bitcoin bond sale, which was initially put on ice in March because of unfavorable market conditions.If the president's tweets are to be believed, then the government's personal bitcoin investment is down about $50 million on paper. (None of these losses are locked in until the country exits its bitcoin position.)""Ultimately, El Salvador's problems are just tangential to currency,"" said Muci.""The issues have to do with security, economic productivity and other things. And bitcoin has nothing to do with any of that,"" he said. El Salvador's big bitcoin gamble may be struggling at the moment, but Sobrado tells CNBC that it has undoubtedly been a win in terms of attracting bitcoin tourists.""While they might be down in terms of unrealized losses in their bitcoin investment, they are extremely up in terms of tourism,"" said Sobrado.""They have attracted a lot of people who are bitcoin believers and a lot of capital from these people. And I think it is entirely possible that if you think of the unrealized losses as a marketing campaign, El Salvador has already achieved what it wanted to,"" continued Sobrado, who also noted that countries like Costa Rica spend billions of dollars on marketing campaigns.The tourism industry is up 30% since the Bitcoin Law took effect in September, according to official government estimates. The country's tourism minister also notes that 60% of tourists now come from the U.S.The bitcoin experiment also hasn't hurt the president's popularity. Bukele's approval ratings are north of 85% — thanks in large part to his tough-on-crime approach to leading. That's no small thing to a country that was more dangerous per capita than Afghanistan five years ago.""Mr. Bukele is, to this day, one of the most popular presidents that is in power,"" said Sobrado. ""He has approval rates of 80 plus percent, that people in other parts of the world just dream of.""As for the country's oppressive levels of debt, virtually everyone agrees that President Bukele will do whatever it takes to pull together enough cash to make good on what the country owes this year and next. A big part of that incentive comes from the upcoming presidential election in 2024, in which Bukele is vying for another five-year term.JPMorgan sees a ""high likelihood"" of that $800 million bond maturity being paid in January, in order to ""avoid disruptive credit events that might derail his prospects for a potential re-election."" Although Fitch expects El Salvador to meet its near-term debt service payments, the credit agency warns that keeping pace with its loans will prove ""more onerous as the year progresses.""Muci agrees that El Salvador will be able to scrape together the cash, but he warns that ultimately the country's public finance situation is unsustainable.""The plane is gonna crash eventually, if they don't change things,"" said Muci. ""If they don't raise taxes, cut spending, start being much more disciplined. You know, convincing markets that they're sustainable.""He added, ""Bitcoin doesn't solve any of El Salvador's important economic problems."""

2022-06-25,"Recruiting and economic experts say they aren't seeing a slowdown in the tech labor market despite some recession fears.They say layoffs and hiring slow-downs are few, leaving the market mostly unmoved.Workers are still ""in the driver's seat"" experts said. Last week, senior product manager for Coinbase David Hong wrote on LinkedIn that he was up at 4am to prepare for a meeting when his company MacBook abruptly shut down. He later found out he was part of the nearly 20% of the company was being laid off from what the company's CEO called a looming recession.""When I joined Coinbase, I accepted that working in this industry would be risky,” Hong wrote on a LinkedIn post. “But on the other hand, I've never given more to a company and was reassured as recently as last week that I / my team was safe.”When Coinbase announced its layoffs, it sent a wave of worry beyond just the crypto industry into the wider tech world.But recruiters wasted no time commenting on Hong's post, and others like it, with hiring opportunities at their companies. While Coinbase was one of several companies that have announced layoffs in recent weeks, recruiters and others involved with tech hiring tell CNBC they’re more outliers than the rule. Even after multiple months of cratering stock prices and inflation in the broader U.S. economy, companies across the industry are still desperate for talent. Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta, Nvidia, and Snap have all announced plans in recent weeks to hire less vigorously, as inflation, the war in Ukraine, and the continuing effects of Covid-19 around the world have dampened the outlook for the rest of the year. Venture capitalists are warning their portfolio companies to prepare for darker times, and some start-ups are laying people off or closing shop.But experts said the cutbacks are so far isolated. “Layoffs appear to be specific to businesses that are in a more fragile financial situations, like if they are unprofitable and funding dried up, or if they just don’t have the runway to continue to operate without additional funding,"" said Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor, a site which job-seekers use to evaluate prospective employers .Zhao added that a few companies are ""reading economic tea leaves and pulling back in uncertainty"" as opposed to necessity.In Netflix’s high-profile layoffs, the company took the action after it reported its first subscriber loss in a decade. Most roles affected weren't tech-related and are based out of Los Angeles. Most are managers or “coordinators,” according to California state documents viewed by CNBC. The company is also still regularly posting job openings each week.But for the majority of the industry, it’s business as usual, experts said. They're still hiring and they still have shortages.“You can’t say there’s broad tech layoffs because it’s so isolated” said Megan Slabinski, a district president for human resources consultants Robert Half. ""I don’t see the demand for tech-related positions being impacted in the foreseeable future.”“Cryptocurrency companies that seem to be run by middle schoolers thinking they’re going to take over the world— those are the ones that are slowing down,” said Valerie Frederickson, founder of executive search firm Frederickson Partners, a division of insurance and risk management company Gallagher. “When VCs put out letters saying ‘hey boys and girls, time to slow down on buying foosball tables, time to get serious here’ — it’s happening to that type of group.""Experts also pointed to examples like a report earlier this month from Reuters, which said Elon Musk wanted to cut 10% of jobs at Tesla, citing a “super bad feeling” about the economy. Musk walked it back later, saying Tesla’s layoff announcement would only affect around 3.5% of its overall workforce, saying the actual amount was “not super material.” “You can lose a lot of trust in the market when you make knee-jerk reactions that can be damaging to your employer brand,” said Lauren Illovsky, talent partner for Alphabet's growth stage venture capital arm, CapitalG. Slabinsksi says one out of every ten calls she gets is related to economic concerns, but most are employers hoping to find if any more talent is becoming available. Candidates are getting several offers at a time, experts said.“When a headline hits, a company calls me and says ‘I see there’s this layoffs, is now a time where I can get better access to talent or ask for more qualifications than a few months ago?’ Slabinski said. “And my response is ‘nope.’” Slabinkski says a recent company report shows 52% of tech workers are still looking to resign or look for new opportunity within the next six months.“We have seen a modest pull-back in demand for tech workers but the level is still way above where it was before the pandemic and companies are still desperate,” said Zhao. Human resources departments at companies that touch the tech ecosystem are in high demand too. “A lot of tech employers are coming to us and asking for four to six different HR searches concurrently because they have that great of a need,” Frederickson.“Workers still have leverage to demand better arrangements, but instead office perks like free lunch and ping pong tables, tech employees are looking for remote work and flexibility,” Zhao said.“Right now, I’m having a lot of conversations about the tradeoffs of going to public companies or private companies,” said CapitalG’s Illovsky. ""The most common theme is ‘should I go to a Facebook, Meta, Apple, Netflix etc. and take advantage of the lower share price knowing that it will hopefully go back up? Or if their equity’s under water at a big tech company, they say ‘should I go to a private company?'”They’re also using their leverage to hold employers' feet to the fire, experts said.“Candidates are asking really hard questions that founders haven’t had to answer for the last few years,” Illovsky said. ""Things like ‘Are you planning to raise a down round?' 'Are we on track to meet our board’s plan?' or 'Are you prepared to work with the headwind of the market?'” Some companies, however, are taking a pause or re-evaluating what they need.Illovsky said she finds herself advising any concerned employees to ""take a beat"" before making moves. Companies, she said, are doing the same although not on a large scale.“When things started to go sideways, it wasn’t a ‘oh s---!' moment because they’re still on an upward trajectory,"" said Illovsky. ”It was more of a re-evaluation in how growth may like in a worsened market, like ‘maybe we invest more in engineering than in marketing.' Or, a company say 'rather than invest all energy in a product in 2026, we’re gonna focus on our core product.'”Generally speaking, though, they're afraid to make any big moves for fear of not being able to hire employees back when they need them. “They’re thinking is this going to be like Covid where some companies slow down their hiring and then have to play catch-up and that puts them behind the ball” said Frederickson.“Their memory of recent history — they don’t want to return to the 2021 job market,"" Zhao said of companies. “They were playing catch up after Covid and keeping up with the absolute frenetic environment that ensued and the struggle to hire back quickly,” Illovsky said.Some experts said the extra pause is ultimately good for the industry, which ballooned in recent years.“I’d like to see a slow a tiny bit so it’s easier for my CEOs and boards to hire good HR leaders without them having so many offers but, unfortunately, I haven’t seen that at all,” Frederickson said."
2022-06-27,"Nearly 60% of Americans said they were worried about hidden cameras in Airbnb homes in 2019.And 11% of vacation home renters said they had discovered a hidden camera during a stay, according to a survey by the real estate investment company IPX1031.Spy cameras are not a new problem. In South Korea, more than 30,000 cases of filming with hidden cameras were reported to the police between 2013 and 2018, according to the New York-based non-profit organization Human Rights Watch.The number of hidden spy camera reports has proliferated because of the increasing accessibility and inexpensiveness of such cameras, combined with the public's growing ability to detect them, said Kenneth Bombace, CEO of intelligence firm Global Threat Solutions.Experts share simple methods to locate hidden spy cameras in hotel rooms and rental properties. When looking for hidden cameras, start with areas like bathrooms and bedrooms, Bombace said.Airbnb hosts are allowed to have cameras in their houses, but they must inform guests and the cameras must not be placed in private spaces, he said. Almost all covert cameras are concealed in household devices, such as lights, thermostats, and plugged clock radios, Bombace said.""Look and see if anything looks like it's out of the ordinary, and then inspect it closer,"" he said.Most spy cameras are connected to an electrical source or an electronic device, Bombace added.He said the first thing he does in a bedroom is unplug the clock radios and put them in a drawer.Michael O'Rourke, CEO of security consulting firm Advanced Operational Concepts, also said he does exactly that.Even well-hidden cameras will have a small amount of reflective glass from the lens, Bombace said.""If you use flashlights and shine them on something you think could possibly hide the camera, you will see a reflection in there, which is a pretty good way of detecting if there's a camera,"" he said. But O'Rourke said care is needed to accurately locate hidden lenses.""A lot of people will try to do amateur lens detection, which can work,"" O'Rourke said. ""However, if you don't have a good search methodology — if you go too fast, if you're impatient — you can miss quite a bit."" A hidden camera must be connected to a local Wi-Fi network in order to be viewed remotely, Bombace said. Wi-Fi scanning apps like Fing can identify devices on the network that are cameras, he said.Those who hide cameras might use a separate Wi-Fi network to stream live video footage, but Wi-Fi scanning apps can also detect how many networks are in a residence, Bombace said.But Kody Kinzie, a security researcher at data security and analytics firm Varonis, warned that a network scanner may not catch everything.""The next thing you can do is look for devices that are broadcasting their own network name,"" he said.He recommended using apps like WiGLE to find devices that are ""broadcasting some sort of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi network name,"" Kinzie added. If all else fails, spy camera detectors can scan for radio frequencies connected to hidden cameras. These can be easily bought online from websites like Amazon or AliExpress.But O'Rourke noted this method works only if the hidden camera is transmitting data.""So many of them now have SD cards that just store data to be retrieved after someone leaves,"" O'Rourke said. ""And so these are much more difficult to detect.""Bombace added that while it is possible to buy a radio frequency scanner, the cheaper ones are probably not that good.""Like anything else, you get what you pay for — if it's $30, it's probably not that good,"" Bombace said. ""Better ones are going to cost hundreds or even over $1,000."" After locating a camera, immediately disconnect it without damaging it because the camera's firmware may contain identifying information, such as login credentials and the Wi-Fi network it was connected to, Kinzie said. O'Rourke said hidden cameras found in hotel rooms should be reported to the front desk. He advised then moving to another hotel instead of requesting another room.""Once you find a camera in a room, I wouldn't trust any other room in that entire hotel,"" he said.Bombace also recommended reporting hidden cameras to the police, even if it is just for documentation purposes, in case litigation or criminal charges should follow.""You could also provide [the report] to Airbnb so they can prevent this person from ever doing this again,"" he said.But ultimately, Bombace said, he would not avoid renting a home over fears of spy cameras.""I would just take common sense steps to protect yourself. And realize you're not in your own home,"" he said."
2022-06-27,"Prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million.Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital issued a notice on Monday morning, stating that the fund failed to repay a loan of $350 million in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, and another 15,250 bitcoin, worth about $323 million at today's prices. Prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million. Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital issued a notice on Monday morning, stating that the fund failed to repay a loan of $350 million in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, and 15,250 bitcoin, worth about $323 million at today's prices.3AC's solvency crunch comes after weeks of turmoil in the crypto market, which has erased hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Bitcoin and ether are both trading slightly lower in the last 24 hours, though well off their all-time highs. Meanwhile, the overall crypto market cap sits at about $950 billion, down from around $3 trillion at its peak in Nov. 2021.Voyager said it intends to pursue recovery from 3AC (Three Arrows Capital). In the interim, the broker emphasized that the platform continues to operate and fulfill customer orders and withdrawals. That assurance is likely an attempt to contain fear of contagion through the wider crypto ecosystem.""We are working diligently and expeditiously to strengthen our balance sheet and pursuing options so we can continue to meet customer liquidity demands,"" said Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich. As of Friday, Voyager said it had approximately $137 million in U.S. dollars and owned crypto assets. The company also noted that it has access to a $200 million cash and USDC revolver, as well as a 15,000 bitcoin ($318 million) revolver from Alameda Ventures.Last week, Alameda (FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's quantitative trading firm) committed $500 million in financing to Voyager Digital, a crypto brokerage. Voyager has already pulled $75 million from that line of credit.""The default of 3AC does not cause a default in the agreement with Alameda,"" the statement said.CNBC did not immediately receive a comment from 3AC. Three Arrows Capital was established in 2012 by Zhu Su and Kyle Davies.Zhu is known for his incredibly bullish view of bitcoin. He said last year the world's largest cryptocurrency could be worth $2.5 million per coin. But in May this year, as the crypto market began its meltdown, Zhu said on Twitter that his ""supercycle price thesis was regrettably wrong.""The onset of a new so-called ""crypto winter"" has hurt digital currency projects and companies across the board.Three Arrow Capital's problems appeared to begin earlier this month after Zhu tweeted a rather cryptic message that the company is ""in the process of communicating with relevant parties"" and is ""fully committed to working this out.""There was no follow-up about what the specific issues were.But the Financial Times reported after the tweet that U.S.-based crypto lenders BlockFi and Genesis liquidated some of 3AC's positions, citing people familiar with the matter. 3AC had borrowed from BlockFi but was unable to meet the margin call.A margin call is a situation in which an investor has to commit more funds to avoid losses on a trade made with borrowed cash.Then the so-called algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and its sister token luna collapsed.3AC had exposure to Luna and suffered losses.""The Terra-Luna situation caught us very much off guard,"" 3AC co-founder Davies told the Wall Street Journal in an interview earlier this month. Three Arrows Capital is still facing a credit crunch exacerbated by the continued pressure on cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin hovered around the $21,000 level on Monday and is down about 53% this year.Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve has signaled further interest rate hikes in a bid to control rampant inflation, which has taken the steam out of riskier assets.3AC, which is one of the biggest crypto-focused hedge funds, has borrowed large sums of money from various companies and invested across a number of different digital asset projects.

2022-06-27,"Robinhood shares jumped on Monday after Bloomberg News reported crypto exchange FTX was considering acquiring the trading app.The stock soared 14% to its session high and was briefly halted after a report that FTX was discussing a takeover plan internally, but no offer has been made to Robinhood, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, denied the report later Monday, however.""We are excited about Robinhood's business prospects and potential ways we could partner with them, and I have always been impressed by the business that Vlad and his team have built,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""That being said there are no active M&A conversations with Robinhood.""Robinhood declined to comment. Last month, Bankman-Fried took a 7.6% stake in Robinhood worth $648 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing said Bankman-Fried acquired the shares in the belief that they ""represent an attractive investment.""Shares of Robinhood have dropped about 48% this year amid shrinking revenue and declining users. During the first quarter, its revenue fell 43% from a year ago to $299 million. Robinhood said its monthly active users declined to 15.9 million, down from 17.7 million a year ago.FTX is one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world and offers derivatives products for more sophisticated traders as well as spot trading. FTX has become a rival to Coinbase and Binance.In recent weeks, Bankman-Fried's companies signed deals to bail out small players in the crypto space. FTX agreed to provide crypto lender BlockFi with a $250 million revolving credit facility. Alameda, his quantitative trading firm, committed $500 million in financing to Voyager Digital, a crypto brokerage.Robinhood attracted a huge number of retail investors during the pandemic trading boom, while the young broker also experienced success when it rolled out its crypto trading platform in 2018. Crypto trading has since become important for the company's bottom line when its stock trading activity slowed down.Last fall, Robinhood said it was testing a crypto wallet and revealed that the waitlist for it had topped 1 million customers."
2022-06-28,"CoinFlex said it would issue $47 million of a digital coin it is calling Recovery Value USD, or rvUSD.CoinFlex CEO Mark Lamb said in a blogpost that a long-time customer's account went into ""negative equity."" That prompted the company to halt withdrawals.By issuing the new rvUSD tokens, CoinFlex will be hoping to raise enough money to cover the shortfall in its books left by the investor and resume withdrawals for users. Cryptocurrency exchange CoinFlex on Tuesday issued a new token to raise funds in a bid to restart withdrawals for its customers, after one client failed to repay a massive debt.CoinFlex said it would issue $47 million worth of a digital coin, offering 20% interest, which it's calling Recovery Value USD, or rvUSD.It comes after the company paused withdrawals for customers last week citing ""extreme market conditions"" and ""uncertainty involving a counterparty.""On Monday, CoinFlex published a blogpost with more details about the counterparty. CEO Mark Lamb said in the post that a long-time customer's account went into ""negative equity."" That prompted the company to halt withdrawals.CoinFlex said in normal circumstances it would automatically liquidate the investor's position but the trader had a clause in his account that did not allow that to happen. That condition required the individual to ""pledge stringent personal guarantees around account equity and margin calls in exchange for not being liquidated,"" CoinFlex said.The company declined to name the investor, but said the individual ""is a high-integrity person of significant means, experiencing temporary liquidity issues due to a credit (and price) crunch in crypto markets (and non-crypto markets), with substantial shareholdings in several unicorn private companies and a large portfolio."" By issuing the new rvUSD tokens, CoinFlex will be hoping to raise enough money to cover the shortfall in its books left by the investor and resume withdrawals for users. It is offering a 20% interest rate for people willing to buy rvUSD to entice investors.""We have been speaking to potential large buyers and believe there is significant interest in the terms presented,"" Lamb said.But part of CoinFlex's plan is hoping that it gets repaid by the investor, which of course, may not happen. Lamb told Bloomberg on Monday that he believes the investor will repay the company ""at some point in the future.""He added that the company has ""alternative mechanisms"" if it can't raise money from issuing rvUSD, but did not elaborate on what those would be.CoinFlex said it hopes to resume withdrawals on June 30. If the rvUSD token issuance is fully subscribed, CoinFlex will re-enable withdrawals and restore the platform to full functionality, the company said.Many users were angry at Lamb. In the company's official Telegram channel, users questioned why CoinFlex was not naming the investor, criticized the company's risk management strategy and also asked how the firm could offer a 20% yield on its new coin.Lamb did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC via Telegram. CoinFlex is the latest victim of a massive drop in cryptocurrency prices in the last few weeks which has wiped billions of dollars off of the digital coin market.The new so-called ""crypto winter"" has exposed the weaknesses in a number of companies' business models that rely heavily on lending and highly-leveraged trading strategies.Celsius, a crypto lending platform that promised high yields to users who deposited their cryptocurrency, paused withdrawals earlier this month. On Monday, high-profile crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million from Voyager Digital.CoinFlex's Lamb promised more transparency in Monday's blogpost. He said that the value of every account's futures position will be made publicly available via an external audit firm that will attest to these positions every hour. The company will also give information on the collateral backing these trading positions. The data will be anonymized however, CoinFlex said.Lamb said this data would give users insight into ""how risky the platform is, how leveraged the users are, and whether any liquidations occur at a loss to the platform."""
2022-06-28,"Bitfury Group CEO Brian Brooks, who previously headed the federal government's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said crypto valuations should not be tied to the idea they can replace the U.S. dollar, during a discussion at the Aspen Ideas Festival.Rather, Brooks said, cryptocurrencies should be viewed as replacing the system of transmitting value.Despite the recent failure of stablecoin TerraUSD, Brooks said he was bullish on the concept of stablecoins playing a bigger role in the banking system in the future. Crypto prices should be viewed more like internet stocks than currency, said Brian Brooks, the former U.S. Acting Comptroller of the Currency during the Trump Administration.The biggest misunderstanding around cryptocurrencies is that if they're ""not doing a great job of replacing the U.S. dollar, then crypto is failing in its mission,"" Brooks, now the CEO of bitcoin mining and crypto tech company Bitfury Group, told CNBC's Ylan Muii at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Monday.""Most of crypto is about replacing the centralized banking system with networks that allow user control versus bank control ... the crypto assets that have prices are more like internet stocks,"" Brooks said. ""It's more like you bet on Google if you think there's going to be high internet traffic; if you short it, it's that people are going to go back to the post office, right? But it's not that ethereum or Ripple or anything else is trying to replace the U.S. dollar, it's trying to replace the system of transmitting value,"" he said.The entire crypto market has slumped in 2022, leading to fears of another ""crypto winter."" Several crypto and tech companies have quickly reversed hiring plans, while many, including leading exchange Coinbase, have laid off workers amid the slide in crypto prices and trading.It has also led many in the industry to forecast that potentially thousands of digital tokens could collapse, a concern that only grew following the recent collapse of so-called algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and its associated digital token luna. There are more than 19,000 cryptocurrencies in existence and dozens of blockchain platforms that exist, according to CNBC research.The Terra issue showed ""we're at the stage where basically there are far too many blockchains out there, too many tokens. And that's confusing users. And that's also bringing some risks for the users,"" Bertrand Perez, CEO of the Web3 Foundation, told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. ""Like at the beginning of the internet, you were having lots of dotcom companies and lots of them were scams, and were not bringing any value and all that got cleared. And now we have very useful and legit companies,"" Perez said.Brooks said that it is worth noting that even amid the crash in prices, bitcoin has still outperformed the S&P 500 by 5x in the last 12 months, and that there isn't a session about ""the future of U.S. equities"" at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Bitcoin is down more than 56% year-to-date.But even amid those sharp changes in valuation, the pricing of cryptocurrencies is ""not that relevant any more than Google's volatility,"" he said.""The value of these tokens you're getting is related to the adoption rate of the underlying [technology], that tens of millions of people are transacting bitcoin, the value of bitcoin goes way up,"" he said. ""That is why bitcoin isn't going to stay at $20,000 because more and more people use it. Same with a lot of other things,"" Brooks said. ""The value of the network is what drives the value of the token,"" he added.Brooks, who signed the first regulatory guidance that defined what a stablecoin was and how it would be allowed inside the U.S. banking system, said that ""stablecoins will become what people think of bank deposits today.""""These will be bank deposits that don't have a minimum balance fee, don't have a monthly maintenance fee, don't have a transaction fee,"" Brooks said, noting that he thinks stablecoins will have a significant impact for lower-income Americans as a result.Disclosure: NBCUniversal News Group is the media partner of the Aspen Ideas Festival."
2022-06-28,"Perhaps the most prominent celebrity figure in the Web3 zeitgeist is Snoop Dogg, along with his son Cordell Broadus, a.k.a. Champ Medici.""I feel like this [crypto winter] weeded out all the people who weren't supposed to be in the space and who were abusing the opportunities that were there,"" Snoop told CNBC in an exclusive interview at last week's NFT.NYC conference in New York City.A liquidity crunch has pushed major crypto players into financial difficulty and given a megaphone to some of the biggest NFT skeptics. Perhaps the most prominent celebrity figure in the Web3 zeitgeist is Snoop Dogg, but for Snoop being an early adopter is nothing new. In 2014, the rap icon was part of a $50 million investment into Reddit, which valued the company at around $500 million at the time. Today, the platform is worth $15 billion, according to PitchBook data. He's also known for private investments into fintech companies like Robinhood, Klarna and MoonPay, and for investments in the cannabis space. In 2015, just one year before weed was approved to be legalized for recreational use in California, Snoop co-founded Los Angeles-based Casa Verde Capital — a VC fund that has more than doubled in size.Of course, these days, anyone following him on Twitter knows that his attention has been consumed by anything and everything that has to do with Web3 ⁠— especially NFTs.NFTs are unique digital assets, like artwork and sports trading cards, that are verified and stored using blockchain technology, but critics see them as overhyped and potentially harmful to the environment given the energy-intensive nature of cryptocurrencies. Many NFTs are built on the network behind ethereum, the second-biggest token. Earlier this year, Snoop announced his plans to turn Death Row Records, a record label that he acquired from Blackstone-controlled MNRK Music Group, into an ""NFT label."" Shortly after, one of his first NFT collections called ""Journey of the Dogg"" saw one token sell at auction for over $100,000. In September, Snoop revealed that he had an alias known as anonymous NFT art collector Cozomo de' Medici, who had a digital collection worth over $17 million.""I know [NFTs] have a great opportunity to be big in music, because sooner or later the labels are going to have to come on in,"" Snoop told CNBC in an exclusive interview at last week's NFT.NYC conference in New York City. ""They're going to have to come on home and sit at the table and understand that catalogs and things they hold onto are better served on the blockchain than sitting in the catalog collecting cobwebs.""""And it's not just labels,"" his son, Cordell Broadus, a.k.a. Champ Medici, added. ""It's movie studios, it's tech companies, it's beverage companies ... everybody's rushing to Web3 and they see how big Dogg is in the space."" Snoop has also spent the past year digging into the metaverse.He recently partnered with gaming platform The Sandbox to sell ""The Snoopverse Early Access Pass"" which gives buyers access to experiences in The Snoopverse, his own branded world within The Sandbox platform. There were 5,000 early access passes minted using blockchain technology at the time of its launch. Each one currently costs a bit more than $600, and according to The Sandbox, there are currently 1,114 owners, which means that the sale has generated nearly $700,000 — a significant haircut from the $1.7 million it had generated earlier in the year. The recent downturn has been dubbed by many as the latest ""crypto winter,"" referring to a period when crypto prices fall and stay low for an extended period of time.""I feel like every great industry has a downfall,"" Snoop said. ""There's been a depression in every industry you can look at ... alcohol, tobacco, clothing, food; every industry you can imagine.""Some crypto industry leaders expect a period of ""creative destruction"" wiping out many players. Mark Cuban, who has become a big investor in blockchain-based technologies, recently compared the crypto crash to ""the lull that the internet went through"" during the dotcom bubble and tweeted that there are too many imitators out there. Snoop Dogg has a similar view.""This [crypto winter] weeded out all the people who weren't supposed to be in the space and who were abusing the opportunities that were there"" he said. ""Now it's going to bring on great business, and moving forward, when the market comes back, there will only be great things to pick and choose from,"" he added.Snoop's latest project is a collaboration with Food Fighters Universe (FFU), which claims to be the world's first NFT restaurant group. His ice cream brand, Dr. Bombay's Sweet Exploration, is set to open in Los Angeles under the FFU umbrella. The brand was inspired by an NFT that Snoop owns from the prominent Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, many of which skyrocketed in price and became the most recognizable NFTs online, but have seen steep declines in price during the recent digital currencies selloff. ApeCoin, a token launched by Bored Ape creators Yuga Labs, has seen a steep increase since Snoop appeared on-stage at NFT.NYC on Thursday night to debut a new single with Eminem, featuring the Bored Ape branding in the rap duo's corresponding music video.As is the case with many NFT collections, FFU token holders have exclusive access to various festivals, benefits and perks via their ownership of one of the 10,000 NFTs in the collection. Additionally, all physical restaurant locations that fall under the FFU umbrella will accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.FFU co-founder Kevin Seo told CNBC it will launch ""within this year"" and will be a dessert retail experience built around the Snoop Dogg community. Separately, Champ Medici's Bored Taco will continue to be a food truck and a ghost kitchen brand. ""We're excited to continue to create ways to utilize crypto as payment and showcase utility through our Food Fighters Universe NFTs, with access to events and free food with our NFT holders,"" Seo said.""Web3 and NFTs? This is just the beginning,"" Champ told CNBC. ""People are going to look back at this five years from now and see how innovative Food Fighters Universe was and how we were pushing the boundaries very early when other people didn't see the vision.""While prominent investors continue to be believers in the long-term potential of digital assets, including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, there are plenty of skeptics.Speaking at a TechCrunch talk on climate change last week, Bill Gates described the crypto and NFT phenomenon as something that's ""100% based on greater fool theory,"" referring to the idea that overvalued assets will go up in price when there are enough investors willing to pay more for them.The billionaire Microsoft co-founder joked that ""expensive digital images of monkeys"" would ""improve the world immensely,"" referring to the much-hyped Bored Apes.Meanwhile, crypto investors continue to grapple with aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and a worsening liquidity crunch that has pushed major players into financial difficulty and given a megaphone to some of the biggest NFT skeptics. The broader space is also still reeling from the fallout of the $60 billion collapse of two major tokens last month."
2022-06-29,"Major cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has fallen into liquidation, a person with knowledge of the matter told CNBC.Teneo Restructuring has been brought on board in the last few days to deal with the liquidation process.A slump in digital currency prices, which has seen billions of dollars wiped off the market in recent weeks, has hurt 3AC and exposed a liquidity crisis at the company. Major cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has fallen into liquidation, a person with knowledge of the matter told CNBC, marking one of the biggest casualties of the latest so-called ""crypto winter.""Teneo has been brought on board in the last few days to deal with the liquidation process, the person, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said.Sky News first reported the liquidation story.Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC as it is also known, did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.Teneo is in the very early stages of the liquidation process, the person said. The restructuring firm is taking steps to realize the assets 3AC has, then it will set up a website in the next day or two with instructions for how creditors can get in touch to make any claims, the source added.3AC, co-founded by Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, is one of the most prominent crypto hedge funds (which focus on investments in digital assets like cryptocurrencies) around and is known for its highly leveraged bets. Zhu has extremely bullish views on bitcoin.But a slump in digital currency prices, which has seen billions of dollars wiped off the market in recent weeks, has hurt 3AC and exposed a liquidity crisis at the company. On Monday, 3AC defaulted on a loan from Voyager Digital made up of $350 million in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, and 15,250 bitcoin, worth about $304.5 million at today's prices.3AC had exposure to the collapsed algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and sister token luna.The Financial Times reported earlier this month that U.S.-based crypto lenders BlockFi and Genesis liquidated some of 3AC's positions, citing people familiar with the matter. 3AC had borrowed from BlockFi but was unable to meet the margin call. A margin call is a situation in which an investor has to commit more funds to avoid losses on a trade made with borrowed cash.The unwinding of 3AC has sparked contagion fears to parts of the market that could potentially be exposed to the company.Other cryptocurrency companies have also faced liquidity issues. Lending firm Celsius and cryptocurrency exchange CoinFlex were forced to pause withdrawals for customers both citing ""extreme market conditions.""CoinFlex however had another issue with a customer that failed to repay a $47 million debt, creating a liquidity problem for the company."
2022-06-29,"Many financial advisors have shied away from bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Despite the current rout those assets are seeing, they still represent a huge opportunity, according to Ric Edelman, a former independent financial advisor and wealth executive.Edelman, who has written a new book, ""The Truth About Crypto,"" shares with CNBC.com what he sees ahead for what he calls a ""wealth creation opportunity that we haven't seen in 35 years."" Bitcoin's recent rout — including its recent drop below $20,000 — has given some cryptocurrency naysayers an ""I told you so"" moment.""How do you make a million?

He has also renounced all of his securities licenses.CNBC.com caught up with Edelman to find out more about his new book, ""The Truth About Crypto,"" and what he sees ahead for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.""Bitcoin will very likely be massively more valuable than it is today, along with a great many other elements of the digital asset community,"" he told CNBC. ""It represents a wealth creation opportunity that we haven't seen in 35 years.""(Editor's note: This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.) Lorie Konish: What is the crypto winter and what does it mean for investments in digital assets?Ric Edelman: A crypto winter refers to a major decline in the prices of bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital assets. Seven times in bitcoin's history, it has fallen in price by 70% or more, and that has become known as a crypto winter.It is not uncommon for emerging new technologies to experience major declines of this degree or of this frequency. If you look at the first 12 years of Amazon, Apple, Google, you'll see very similar price performance of their stocks in their early years of development. It's routine as you're innovating a new technology, gaining market share and achieving maturity that you see massive price volatility along the way to producing unprecedented levels of profits. Even though bitcoin has experienced these massive declines many times, it has generated a 40 million percent total return since inception. Even since 2018, even though bitcoin is now down 70% since November, since 2018, it's up 7x — not 7% — 7x. This is what innovation is all about, and you need to maintain a long-term perspective and be willing to tolerate this kind of incredible volatility along the way.LK: There were many naysayers in the financial advisor community before this, who may take this as proof for what they already believe. What would you have to say to them?RE: That they would not tolerate that sentiment if clients were to express that view regarding stocks. In the early days of the pandemic, the stock market fell 35% in six weeks. If you look at a short-term time period like that, and use it as an argument that stocks are risky, too risky to invest in, advisors would say that's an artificial time period. You need to look at a more lengthy period of time to reach a more legitimate conclusion.The same thing is true about crypto. You can easily look at the past nine months and say the 70% decline in bitcoin proves that it's too risky to invest in. But if you look at the past four years, with a 7x return, you would have a very different perspective. What I find is that people who are using this latest decline as an argument against bitcoin is merely confirmation bias and recency bias, advisors with a preconceived notion grabbing at a unique data point to prove an argument that is specious in the first place. LK: What are the risks of not investing in crypto?RE: In my new book, ""The Truth About Crypto,"" I recommend a 1% asset allocation to digital assets. This is a very new asset class. It's developing and maturing, and it faces a great many risks. You have the potential for regulatory risk. You have the risk of fraud and abuse. There's technological risk. There is always the potential of decreased market demand. Because of that, I recommend a very low single-digit allocation to this asset class as part of a diversified portfolio. With that said, if instead of doing 1%, you do zero, you run the risk of being 100% wrong. Bitcoin's price history has proven that a very low asset allocation, 1% or 2% or 3%, is enough to materially improve the overall return of the portfolio. While if bitcoin goes broke and becomes worthless, a 1% loss isn't going to cause you significant financial harm. The risk of not investing means that you could be 100% wrong.LK: As you point out in the book, investing in digital assets doesn't necessarily mean directly in cryptocurrencies. So you can still get exposure to this elsewhere?RE: Absolutely correct. Just because you're a fan of the automotive industry, doesn't mean you need to buy stock in General Motors. Instead, you might buy stock in companies that manufacture asphalt, because those cars are going to need roads to drive on. Or you might invest in companies that manufacture white paint, because those roads have to be painted. Or you invest in companies that build traffic lights and stop signs. There are a great many ways to invest in an industrial sector without a direct investment. It's called the picks and shovels approach made famous by Levi Strauss, who never mined for gold during the California gold rush but instead sold blue jeans to the gold miners.This very same approach can be used in crypto. Instead of buying bitcoin, invest in the companies that are facilitating and building the technology. You can invest in publicly traded bitcoin miners or in crypto exchanges that allow investors to buy and sell crypto. You can invest in Nvidia, which is a computer chip manufacturer that provides the chips that bitcoin miners use to mine bitcoin. You can invest in blockchain development companies, such as IBM, or Silvergate Bank, which is a digital bank chartered by the government. There are a great many ways you can invest thematically in this asset class without directly owning bitcoin itself. LK: What are the most common misconceptions around crypto that you hear?RE: The most common is that there's no way to value bitcoin, that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. This is an extraordinarily common mistake, often perpetuated by very well-respected people in the financial field, such as Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett. Jamie Dimon is infamous for saying bitcoin has no intrinsic value.The problem with economists and market analysts who make this statement is that they're applying traditional economic modelling of stocks to crypto. What they fail to understand is digital assets is a brand-new asset class that has nothing in common with the stock market. And trying to apply traditional methodologies of stock valuation to digital assets leads you to the wrong conclusion.As a market analyst, you would look at a company's product, you would look at its competition, at its management, at its products. You would examine its revenues and its profits. But if you try to do that with bitcoin, you discover that there is no company, there are no employees, there is no product, no revenues and no profits. All of those numbers are zeroes, and that would lead you to conclude that bitcoin has zero intrinsic value, causing you to reach the wrong conclusion. Instead of trying to compare bitcoin the way you would compare shares of IBM, you need to recognize that bitcoin, rather than being a product, is instead a network. And networks are valued based on the number of users on the network and the rate of growth of the user adoption. When you look at it from that perspective, you can compare it to AT&T, which is a network, or to Netflix or Facebook, which are networks. You begin to realize that the bitcoin network is growing so rapidly that there is an exponential effect of the increased value of the network itself, which grows exponentially faster than the number of user adoption on the network. This is a fundamental basis for how you acknowledge that while bitcoin may not have a value, it very certainly has a price, which is being set by the marketplace.LK: Where do you see crypto in 10 years?RE: It will be a routine element of commerce on a global scale. McKinsey says that 70% of global GDP by 2030 will be digital. Every central bank in the world will be offering digital currency, and the functionality of our personal finances through digital assets will be routine.It's hard for us to remember that the iPhone is only 14 years old. And yet today, we couldn't imagine leaving home without it. Most of us are within three feet of our phones 24/7. Blockchain technology will be as pervasive and routine a part of our lives. The sooner people begin to realize this, the sooner they will be able to capture the economic and investment opportunities this represents."

That is also sparking fears of a recession in the U.S. and other countries. The crypto price crash has exposed the highly leveraged nature of the industry and caused a liquidity issue across companies.Cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital fell into liquidation this week, a person with knowledge of the matter told CNBC. The company had exposure to the now-collapsed terraUSD algorithmic stablecoin and sister token luna. Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC as it is also known, also reportedly failed to meet a margin call from BlockFi. A margin call is a situation in which an investor has to commit more funds to avoid losses on a trade made with borrowed cash.Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange CoinFlex paused withdrawals for customers last week citing ""extreme market conditions."" CoinFlex CEO Mark Lamb also said that long-time crypto investor Roger Ver owes the company $47 million.

2022-06-30,"Coinbase plans to hire a regional manager to oversee its European operations, Nana Murugesan, the firm's vice president of international, told CNBC.The company is in talks to get regulatory approval in various countries, including France, said Katherine Minarik, Coinbase's vice president of legal.Coinbase is racing to keep pace with rivals like Binance, FTX and Crypto.com, which have gained significant traction in territories outside the U.S. Coinbase is seeking licenses with various countries in Europe as part of an aggressive expansion in the region.The exchange already has an active presence in the U.K., Ireland and Germany, but wants to set up operations in Spain, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, according to Nana Murugesan, Coinbase's vice president of international. Coinbase recently hired its first employee in Switzerland, he says.The U.S. crypto giant is looking to international markets to drive growth amid fears of a looming ""crypto winter."" Earlier this month, Coinbase announced it would lay off 18% of its workforce, while other firms including Gemini and BlockFi haven taken similar steps amid a fall in crypto prices.Still, Murugesan says Coinbase is planning to hire a regional manager to oversee its European operations. The firm is mainly prioritizing ""mission-critical roles"" in fields like security and compliance after a period of rapid growth, he added.""When we entered U.K. and Europe, this was actually during the last big bear market in 2015-2016,"" said Murugesan, who joined Coinbase in January 2022.""But then when you fast forward to 2017-2018, the U.K. is now a massive part of our business, as is Europe,"" he added. ""We entered, we made bets. I'm sure it was probably a tough time. But it's paid off, significantly.""Coinbase is in talks to get approval under anti-money laundering rules in a number of countries, including France, said Katherine Minarik, the company's vice president of legal.The company is gearing up for MiCA, or Markets in Crypto-Assets, a landmark piece of legislation from the EU that aims to harmonize the regulation of crypto across the bloc. Officials from the European Council and Parliament are due to meet Thursday in a bid to reach an agreement on the rules. If all goes smoothly, the expectation is that MiCA will come into force by 2024.Once approved, it will enable Coinbase to ""passport"" its services into all 27 EU member states, Minarik said. While Coinbase is the biggest crypto exchange in the U.S., it's facing intense competition from newer players like Binance, FTX and Crypto.com. Binance's U.S. affiliate recently ditched fees for customers trading bitcoin, news that sent shares of Coinbase tumbling.Coinbase is racing to keep pace with its rivals, which are gaining significant traction in territories outside the U.S.In the Middle East, for example, both Binance and FTX obtained licenses in Dubai. Binance also secured authorization in France and Italy and is seeking approvals in additional European countries.""Being a publicly traded company, the bar is very high,"" Murugesan said. ""Sometimes it may take a bit longer to get some things done. But we want to stay the course.""At the same, major crypto players — Coinbase included — are reeling from a dramatic plunge in digital currency prices, which some investors believe will be the start of a much longer downturn known as ""crypto winter."" A confluence of factors is weighing on the market, including higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve and the collapse of the UST stablecoin. The slump in token prices has in turn led to solvency issues at investment firms that loaded up with leverage, like Three Arrows Capital.Coinbase made a sudden U-turn on its cost-cutting strategy this month, announcing plans to cut roughly 1,100 employees globally. Though the cuts affected 18% of Coinbase's global headcount overall, Murugesan says its U.K. workforce was less impacted with around 7% of roles cut locally.Coinbase reported a 27% decline in revenues in the first quarter as overall usage of the platform declined. The business is currently heavily reliant on trading fees. But it's hoping to diversify into new products, including nonfungible tokens and interest-like rewards known as staking.Coinbase has around 9.2 million monthly transacting users globally but less than 50% of those are using the app for trading, Murugesan said."
2022-07-01,"Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital is pausing all customer temporarily suspending customer trading, deposits, and withdrawals, according to a statement released Friday afternoon. ""This was a tremendously difficult decision, but we believe it is the right one given current market conditions,"" said Stephen Ehrlich, CEO of lending company Voyager.  Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital has paused all customer trading, deposits, withdrawals and loyalty rewards, according to a statement released Friday afternoon.""This was a tremendously difficult decision, but we believe it is the right one given current market conditions,"" said Stephen Ehrlich, CEO of lending company Voyager.Erlich went on to say that the decision is designed to give the firm additional time to continue ""exploring strategic alternatives with various interested parties"" and that they will provide additional information at ""the appropriate time.""Voyager's announcement comes amid a raft of margin calls and defaults across the sector, making the digital broker the latest collateral damage of the broad market selloff in cryptocurrency. The two most widely traded cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, are down more than 70% from their peaks last November, and the May collapse of the UST stablecoin sent shockwaves through an already tumultuous market.The news comes a few days after one of Voyager's customers failed to make payments on a loan worth hundreds of millions of dollars, fueling growing concerns of an insolvency contagion effect across the industry.On Monday, the broker issued a notice that prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) had defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million. At the time, Voyager said that it intended to pursue recovery from 3AC, and in the interim, said it would continue to operate and fulfill customer orders and withdrawals.As of June 24, Voyager said it had approximately $137 million in U.S. dollars and owned crypto assets. The company also noted that it has access to a $200 million credit line in cash and USDC stablecoins, as well as a 15,000 bitcoin ($318 million) revolving credit line from Alameda Ventures, which is FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's quantitative trading firm.Last week, Alameda committed $500 million in financing to Voyager, and the firm has already pulled $75 million from that line of credit, but it appears that wasn't enough to keep business running as usual.Thus far, investors in the world's two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap seem unfazed by the news. Bitcoin is up about 2% and ethereum is up more than 4% toward the end of regular market hours on Wall Street.Voyager is a competitor to crypto lending firm BlockFi, which has also been caught in the crosshairs of the sector's recent liquidity crunch. FTX has just struck a $680 million credit deal to acquire BlockFi, according to The Block.Voyager's decision tracks that of popular crypto staking and lending platform, Celsius, which similarly paused all withdrawals, swaps, and transfers between accounts due to ""extreme market conditions"" on June 13. Celsius has yet to announce tangible guidance on next steps."
2022-07-01,"Meta announced Friday that it's shuttering its digital wallet, Novi, on Sept. 1.The move comes amid a broad downturn in the cryptocurrency market and new scrutiny on stablecoins.It's the last remnant of the Diem project, formerly known as Libra, that Facebook kicked off some years ago. Meta plans to shutter its Novi digital wallet on Sept. 1, just eleven months after the company formerly known as Facebook debuted it.The company announced the upcoming closure on Novi's website, informing customers that ""The Novi pilot is ending soon"" and will no longer be available for use after that date.Meta said Novi users should withdraw their remaining balance on their Novi accounts before the closure date. People can either transfer their remaining balance to their bank account or withdraw the digital funds as cash where applicable, the company said. Novi users will be unable to access their accounts after Sept. 1, which means they won't be able to retrieve account information like their transaction history.The company released Novi last October in a so-called beta, or testing, version with the help of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Coinbase acted as Meta's ""custody partner"" on the project, providing digital storage and security technologies to help the Novi app secure people's funds, the crypto exchange said in October in a corporate blog post. At the time, Meta pitched Novi as an easy way for people to send and receive money with the help of the cryptocurrency Paxos Dollar, or USDP, stablecoin. At one point, Meta planned to issue and accept the Diem cryptocurrency, which was backed by a Facebook-led association, in conjunction with the Novi wallet.However, the Diem cryptocurrency project, overseen by the Meta-backed Diem Association, faced intense scrutiny from regulators, which led to its demise. The leader of the project, David Marcus, announced his departure from Facebook last November. In January, the crypto-focused Silvergate bank bought all Diem-associated intellectual property and assets from the Diem Association, a major setback for Meta. ""Despite giving us positive substantive feedback on the design of the network, it nevertheless became clear from our dialogue with federal regulators that the project could not move ahead,"" Diem CEO Stuart Levey said in a statement at the time. ""As a result, the best path forward was to sell the Diem Group's assets, as we have done today to Silvergate.""Since then, stablecoins have come under intense scrutiny amid a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market. The May collapse of UST, which lost its peg to the dollar, concerned investors and regulators that certain types of stablecoins might not have the backing necessary to redeem them in the case of a run.Meta shares were flat in after-hours trading at $160.00."
2022-07-01,"The so-called crypto winter isn't over yet — and a number of cryptocurrency exchanges have already run out of cash, billionaire and founder of crypto exchange FTX Sam Bankman-Fried said on Tuesday.There are ""some third-tier exchanges that are already secretly insolvent,"" Bankman-Fried told Forbes. The 30-year-old's own fortune has taken a significant cut this year as crypto has crashed, but still sits at $8.1 billion, according to Bloomberg.Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, lost 58% of its value in the second quarter of the year, putting it on pace for its worst quarterly performance since 2011. It fell below $19,000 on Thursday, a long way from its all-time high of nearly $69,000. Bitcoin led the slide of the overall cryptocurrency market, whose market valuation now sits below $1 trillion, down from its November 2021 peak of more than $3 trillion.Bankman-Fried's FTX has been seen as a lender of last resort in the crypto space — meaning that it has given loans to exchanges near collapse — and on Thursday CNBC reported that it is close to a deal to buy crypto lender BlockFi for roughly $25 million. Still, Bankman-Fried said there are more crypto firms that will likely go under.""There are companies that are basically too far gone and it's not practical to backstop them for reasons like a substantial hole in the balance sheet, regulatory issues or that there is not much of a business left to be saved,"" he said Tuesday, without naming any specific companies.Fellow billionaire and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban previously described the current crypto slide as echoing the early 2000s dotcom bubble, when speculative investing inflated the valuations of internet-based companies over a 5-year span before a steep crash in 2001 and 2002.""Crypto is going through the lull that the early internet went through,"" Cuban said. The space is currently stuck in an ""imitation phase"" where there are too many companies with too little new utility. Like Bankman-Fried, he predicted that more companies will fail.""The chains that copy what everyone else has, will fail,"" Cuban tweeted.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: 25-year-old TikTok creator with 7 million followers saves 50% of her income: 'I don't touch it'"

2022-07-05,"Here are the most important news items that investors need to start their trading day: U.S. investors returned from the three-day July Fourth holiday weekend to find stock futures down yet again. The market wrapped up its worst first half in more than 50 years last week, but the second half isn't shaping up to look so rosy, either, at least not in its early days. Earnings season is just around the corner, too, which could mean even more down times ahead, as companies grapple with the impact of inflation on their bottom lines. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday held virtual talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to address macroeconomic conditions, including U.S. sanctions and tariffs on China. President Joe Biden has suggested the U.S. could drop some Trump-era levies on Chinese goods. The officials also talked about stubborn supply chain problems, several of which stem from parts of China that have been under pandemic lockdowns. Several Chinese cities and regions have ramped up Covid restrictions in recent days, indicating the economic impact of the disease on the world's second-largest economy is far from settled. There is no sign of relief in the euro zone. Russia has made significant gains in Ukraine, and the war will rage on for a while, which means European consumers will continue to feel the crunch from elevated prices for goods and energy. Investor confidence in the euro zone has also fallen to a level last seen early in the Covid pandemic. All of this has translated into historic weakness for the euro, which fell to a 20-year low against the dollar Tuesday. The European Central Bank is set to raise rates for the first time in 11 years this month. Some of Europe's greatest fears about energy are playing out, as countries work to stockpile natural gas. As Russia prepares to shut down a major gas pipeline into Germany for maintenance, officials are worried Vladimir Putin's government could keep the taps off for longer than the July 11-21 period. Some think Russia could cut off Europe for good as nations there continue to support Ukraine's defense. ""We cannot rule out the possibility that gas transport will not be resumed afterwards for political reasons,"" the head of Germany's energy regulator told CNBC. ""Crypto winter"" is getting harsher. Vauld, a crypto lender backed by Peter Thiel and Coinbase, halted withdrawals, trades and deposits Monday. The Singapore-based company also said it is considering options for restructuring. Vauld also said it is talking to prospective investors, less than three weeks after its CEO said the company was operating normally despite strife in the crypto space.

The filing lists assets of between $1 billion and $10 billion, and liabilities in the same range.In a statement, the company said it has roughly $1.3 billion of crypto on its platform and holds more than $350 million in cash on behalf of customers at New York's Metropolitan Commercial Bank.Voyager suffered huge losses from its exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which went bust last week after defaulting on loans from a number of firms in the industry — including $650 million from Voyager.""We strongly believe in the future of the industry but the prolonged volatility in the crypto markets, and the default of Three Arrows Capital, require us to take this decisive action,"" Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich said in a tweet early Wednesday.The Toronto-listed company's shares have lost nearly 98% of their value since the start of 2022.Voyager says it is still pursuing the recovery of funds from Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC as it's otherwise known, including through court-supervised proceedings in the British Virgin Islands and New York. Last week, Voyager paused all withdrawals, deposits and trading on its platform due to ""current market conditions."" Ehrlich at the time said Voyager was seeking additional time to explore ""strategic alternatives with various interested parties.""Several other companies, including Celsius, Babel Finance and Vauld, have taken similar steps. On Tuesday, Vauld received a takeover offer from Nexo, a rival firm, after suspending its services.The crypto market is grappling with a severe liquidity crisis as platforms struggle to meet a flood of withdrawals from customers amid a sharp fall in digital currency prices.The declines in crypto started with a broad fall in risky assets as the Federal Reserve embarked on monetary tightening, and gathered pace following the collapse of Terra, a so-called stablecoin venture that was worth around $60 billion at its height.Bitcoin, the world's largest token, had its worst month on record in June, plunging 38%. Investors are bracing for a much longer downturn in digital currencies known as a ""crypto winter."" Voyager said the bankruptcy proceedings would allow it to implement a restructuring process so that customers can be reimbursed. If all goes according to plan, users would receive a combination of crypto in their accounts, proceeds from the recovery of funds from Three Arrows Capital, shares of the newly reorganized company and Voyager tokens.Clients with U.S. dollar deposits will regain access to their funds once a reconciliation and fraud prevention process with Metropolitan Commercial Bank is complete, Voyager said.Alameda Research, the quant trading shop of billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, had extended Voyager a line of credit worth $500 million in cash and crypto last month in a futile attempt to tide the company over.Alameda was listed as Voyager's largest creditor in the bankruptcy filing Tuesday, with an unsecured claim of $75 million.Bankman-Fried, who also founded crypto exchange FTX, has become a lender of last resort for the troubled industry. He recently agreed to a deal giving FTX the option to buy crypto lending company BlockFi for up to $240 million — a dramatic drawdown from the $3 billion it was last privately valued at.Some have likened Bankman-Fried's efforts to the role played by famous banker John Pierpont, or J.P., Morgan in rescuing Wall Street lenders from collapse after a series of bank runs known as the Panic of 1907, which preceded the establishment of the Fed."
2022-07-06,"Crypto lending platforms like Celsius, Anchor, and Voyager Digital rose to prominence for offering sky-high returns of up to 20% annually on customer deposits.Much of that crypto cash is now trapped, as plunging token prices force platforms to temporarily suspend or limit withdrawals.Shehan Chandrasekera, a certified public accountant, says the U.S. tax code may eventually provide some relief to these investors by way of the nonbusiness bad debt write-off. Crypto lending platforms like Celsius, Anchor, and Voyager Digital rose to prominence for offering almost unbelievable returns of up to 20% annually on customer deposits. Now much of that crypto cash is trapped, as plunging token prices force platforms to temporarily suspend or limit withdrawals.In the wake of its own solvency crisis, Celsius — which is still advertising up to 18.63% annual yield on its website — has had customer funds on ice for more than three weeks and has yet to announce tangible guidance on next steps.So who is going to be left holding the bag if these platforms go belly up?Unlike the traditional banking system, which typically insures customer deposits, there aren't formal consumer protections in place to safeguard user funds when things go wrong on decentralized finance platforms. 'High risk, high reward' is the general motto of the DeFi ecosystem. For those who lost their life savings to these crypto lending platforms, there is little recourse for recouping their losses.But Shehan Chandrasekera, a certified public accountant, tells CNBC the U.S. tax code may provide some relief to these investors by way of an obscure deduction.""If your funds become totally worthless and irrecoverable, you may be eligible to write them off as a nonbusiness bad debt on your taxes,"" said Chandrasekera, lead tax strategist at CoinTracker.io, a digital currency tax software company that helps clients track their crypto across virtual wallet addresses and manage their tax obligations.""It's not going to cover up your entire economic loss, but it's going to give you some type of tax benefit, because at least you get to write off that initial investment that you put in,"" Chandrasekera. You can think of a nonbusiness bad debt as a type of loss resulting from a debt extended to another party, which has been rendered totally worthless and irrecoverable.CPA Lewis Taub stresses that there must be a complete loss of all that was lent to the platform in order for the debt to be considered deductible. Partial losses don't count. The freezing of accounts, or limited withdrawals by crypto platforms, does not constitute a total loss.At this stage, many of the crypto platforms are still calling the freezes ""temporary"" as they figure out how to shore up some liquidity, whether through restructuring or securing additional lines of credit.Chandrasekera says that a debt falls into this category of ""totally uncollectible"" only after all attempts at collection have failed. So technically, none of the crypto funds on deposit at these platforms are completely worthless.""It's also deemed worthless if the borrower files for bankruptcy and the debt is discharged,"" Chandrasekera explained in a tweet thread detailing how filers could claim the deduction.However, Taub says that even if a platform declares bankruptcy, the holders may still get something in bankruptcy court, so it's still not a total loss. Voyager Digital, for example, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Tuesday evening, but it's not yet clear whether users will be able to recover some of their losses through this process.Determining whether the cash you have given to a crypto platform constitutes a loan isn't always straightforward. For example, crypto coins and stocks, both of which are considered to be nondebt instruments, do not qualify for this write-off.""In order to have a nonbusiness bad debt, there needs to be an actual debtor-creditor relationship. So to the extent that crypto was loaned to a platform, that criteria is met,"" said Taub, who is the director of tax services at Berkowitz Pollack Brant, one of the largest public accounting firms in Florida. Take Celsius. It spells out in its terms and conditions that any digital asset transferred to the platform constitutes a loan from the user to Celsius.Not all platforms are this transparent in their terms and conditions, however. Neither Voyager nor BlockFi clearly describe the relationship that the user has with the platform, according to Chandrasekera.That's also why CPAs advise that those affected by crypto platform suspensions reach out to a financial advisor to see whether their investment qualifies.""You have to talk to an advisor and see, 'OK, what kind of relationship do I have? Does it look or does it smell like debt?'"" continued Chandrasekera.""Because if you're earning something like a reward, you could argue that it's an interest income that you're getting,"" he said. ""So in those platforms, you have to kind of go one by one and see what type of relationship you have with the platform."" Should the crypto lending platform meet the aforementioned criteria, an individual can report the initial value of the cryptocurrency (that is, the cost basis) when it was first lent to the platform as a short-term capital loss.Let's take the case of a hypothetical crypto investor named Dan, who bought bitcoin for $10,000 in 2020. In 2022, Dan then lent that same bitcoin, now worth $50,000, to a DeFi platform offering him 15% APY on his bitcoin. This platform then suffers an insolvency crunch and goes belly up, rendering Dan's debt totally worthless. In that case, Chandrasekera says Dan would be able to claim his basis of $10,000 as a nonbusiness bad debt.There are certain capital loss limitations to keep in mind, namely the fact that nonbusiness bad debt is always considered a short-term capital loss.In the case of Dan, therefore, if he does not have any other capital gains (from stocks or other crypto investments) lined up for this tax year, Chandrasekera says that out of the $10,000 total nonbusiness bad debt, he could deduct $3,000 this year and carry forward the balance of $7,000 to offset future capital gains.As for the actual mechanics of reporting nonbusiness bad debt, the deduction goes on Form 8949 as a short-term capital loss. That's where a user also files their crypto and stock gains and losses.Chandrasekera notes that you have to attach a ""bad debt statement"" to the return explaining the nature of this loss, as well. Among other details, that must include ""efforts you made to collect the debt and why you decided the debt was worthless,"" according to the IRS.The IRS warns that if you later recover or collect some of the bad debt you've deducted, you might have to include it in your gross income. Taub says that these days — to the extent that there are potential losses on actual holdings of crypto — he is advising clients to take advantage of the fact that ""wash sale rules"" do not apply to crypto. He tells CNBC that investors should really be watching their portfolio to consider ""harvesting losses"" to offset capital gains on other investments.Because the IRS classifies digital currencies like bitcoin as property, losses on crypto holdings are treated much differently than losses on stocks and mutual funds, according to former Onramp Invest CEO Tyrone Ross. With crypto tokens, wash sale rules don't apply, meaning that you can sell your bitcoin and buy it right back, whereas with a stock, you would have to wait 30 days to buy it back.This nuance in the tax code is huge for crypto holders in the U.S., primarily because it paves the way for tax-loss harvesting.""One thing savvy investors do is sell at a loss and buy back bitcoin at a lower price,"" explained Chandrasekera. ""You want to look as poor as possible.""The more losses you can rack up, the better it is for the investor's tax situation in the long run.""You can harvest an unlimited amount of losses and carry them forward into an unlimited number of tax years,"" Chandrasekera added.Because the wash sale rule doesn't apply, investors can harvest their crypto losses more aggressively than with stocks, because there's no baked-in waiting period.""I see people doing this every month, every week, every quarter, depending on their sophistication,"" he said. ""You can collect so many of these losses.""Accruing these losses is how investors ultimately offset their future gains.When an individual goes to liquidate their crypto stake, they can use these collected losses to bring down what they owe to the IRS through the capital gains tax.Quickly buying back the crypto is another key part of the equation. If timed correctly, buying the dip enables investors to catch the ride back up, if the price of the digital coin rebounds.So let's say a taxpayer purchases one bitcoin for $10,000 and sells it for $50,000. This individual would face $40,000 of taxable capital gains. But if this same taxpayer had previously harvested $40,000 worth of losses on earlier crypto transactions, they'd be able to offset the tax they owe.It's a strategy that is catching on among CoinTracker users, according to Chandrasekera.Still, he cautioned that thorough bookkeeping is essential.""Without detailed records of your transaction and cost basis, you cannot substantiate your calculations to the IRS,"" he warned.WATCH: Bitcoin prices slip, crypto winter's latest victim"
2022-07-06,"Sam Bankman-Fried, head of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, said he and his company still have a ""few billion"" on hand to shore up struggling firms that could further destabilize the digital asset industry.He also said the worst of the liquidity crunch has likely passed.As the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun aggressively hiking rates to combat hyperinflation, investors have fled the crypto markets. Sam Bankman-Fried, head of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, said he and his company still have a ""few billion"" on hand to shore up struggling firms that could further destabilize the digital asset industry, but that the worst of the liquidity crunch has likely passed.Bankman-Fried, 30, who is from California but lives in the Bahamas where FTX is based, has become crypto's white knight in recent weeks, throwing lifelines to digital asset platforms which have faltered as cryptocurrencies prices have cratered. Bitcoin is down around 70% from its all-time November high of nearly $69,000.""We're starting to get a few more companies reaching out to us,"" Bankman-Fried said in an interview. Those firms are generally not in dire situations, though some smaller crypto exchanges may still fail, he said, adding that the industry has moved beyond ""other big shoes that have to drop.""Bankman-Fried's crypto-trading firm, Alameda Research, gave crypto-lender Voyager Digital a $200 million cash and stablecoin revolving credit facility, and a facility of bitcoin, as the company faced losses from exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. On Wednesday, Voyager filed for bankruptcy.Also in June, FTX handed U.S. cryptocurrency lender BlockFi a $250 million revolving credit facility and on Friday announced a deal giving FTX the right to purchase it based on certain performance triggers.The goal of the bailouts was to protect customer assets and stop contagion from ricocheting through the system, Bankman-Fried said.""Having trust with consumers that things will work as advertised is incredibly important and if broken is incredibly hard to get back,"" he said.In January, FTX unveiled FTX Ventures, a $2 billion venture capital fund focused on digital asset investments, which it has since drawn on to help bail out firms that are lacking liquidity, but not assets.""It does get increasingly expensive with each one of these,"" Bankman-Fried said, adding that the firm still had enough cash on hand to do a $2 billion deal if necessary.""If all that mattered was one single event, we could get above a couple billion,"" he said, stressing that isn't his preference.On one or two occasions, Bankman-Fried, who made billions arbitraging cryptocurrency prices in Asia beginning in 2017, said he has used his own cash to backstop failing crypto companies when it didn't make sense for FTX to do so.""FTX has shareholders and we have a duty to do reasonable things by them and I certainly feel more comfortable incinerating my own money,"" he said.Bankman-Fried also in May revealed he had personally taken a 7.6% stake in Robinhood Markets Inc, capitalizing on the trading app's weakened share price.Forbes pegged Bankman-Fried's net worth this year at around $24 billion, but Bloomberg's Billionaires Index in May said that figure has been cut in half due to the crypto crash. As the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun aggressively hiking rates to combat hyperinflation, investors have fled the crypto markets.The crash in cryptocurrency prices, referred to as ""crypto winter,"" may have bottomed, as prices have stabilized, but it will largely depend on the macro-economic situation, said Bankman-Fried, a 2014 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.""I don't think it's an existential threat to the industry, but I do think it is a fair bit worse that I would have anticipated,"" Bankman-Fried said.Bankman-Fried started his career in finance at quantitative trading firm Jane Street, then founded crypto trading firm Alameda Research and in 2019 set up FTX, which was valued in January at $32 billion.He has said he plans to give away 99% of his wealth, and that he could spend up to $100 million supporting candidates in the 2024 election cycle, focusing on issues like pandemic prevention and bipartisanship.While rival crypto exchanges face layoffs after earlier hiring sprees, FTX has around 300 employees, and Crunchbase pegs Alameda's staff at fewer than 50.""Every quarter this year, I expect our workforce to be bigger than the previous quarter, but we're trying not to grow insanely quickly,"" he said."
2022-07-07,"Digital currency asset manager Grayscale is in a legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its latest rejection of the company's prospective spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Last Wednesday, the SEC denied Grayscale's application to convert its bitcoin trust to a spot ETF. The company filed a lawsuit the same day. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, under the ticker GBTC, is the world's biggest publicly traded bitcoin fund.""We were simply asking the SEC to hold this product to a higher standard, to give it greater investor protection and give greater risk disclosure for investors,"" Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" on Wednesday of this week. ""Converting would unlock billions of dollars of unrealized shareholder value.""He identified potentially capricious treatment by the SEC, which allows bitcoin futures products to trade under specific rules and regulations but denies spot products an equal opportunity. ""The inconsistent treatment here by the SEC — allowing the futures products to trade but denying the spot products to trade — is not looking at what is essentially the same exact market through a like lens here,"" Sonnenshein said. ""In fact, the treatment is quite disparate.""Todd Rosenbluth of VettaFi, a financial services company, joined the conversation to share his thoughts on what could change the SEC perspective. The commission made a distinction between futures- and spot-based products, citing the regulations tied to bitcoin futures-based ETFs.""I wish Michael [Sonnenshein] best of luck in the lawsuit, but it's hard to convince the SEC that there isn't going to be fraud and manipulation when that's what they're clearly asking the asset managers to disprove time and time again,"" VettaFi's head of research said.Markets in Canada, Brazil and parts of Europe show promise for spot bitcoin ETFs, according to Sonnenshein. Rather than bring the prospective ETF to international markets right away, the Grayscale CEO hopes to repair cryptocurrency regulation domestically.""What we're going to see, and what we intend to see, is working proactively with the SEC and other regulators here in the U.S. to really answer that White House executive order from earlier this year to engage on crypto issues and ultimately develop regulatory frameworks that create consistent treatment and develop frameworks that can actually allow businesses to grow and not squander innovation here in the U.S. as it relates to crypto,"" Sonnenshein said. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was trading higher Thursday. However, it's down more than 50% over the past 52 weeks.The SEC declined to provide comment beyond its order denying Grayscale's application."
2022-07-07,"The American Gaming Association says illegal operators are a ""serious threat.""The industry trade group is asking Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Department of Justice to enforce existing laws.FanDuel's CEO says unregulated, offshore sites have an unfair advantage because they don't pay state and local taxes and don't invest in compliance or lobbying for the expansion of sports gambling in the U.S. American casinos, gaming companies and lawmakers are calling on federal prosecutors to crack down on illegal offshore gambling sites that they say are evading consumer protection regulations. The push comes as sports gambling has quickly expanded in the U.S. in recent years, with more than 30 states and Washington, D.C., allowing it.""What maybe at one point in time was a relative nuisance, is now becoming a serious threat to the legal, licensed gaming industry,"" Bill Miller, CEO of the American Gaming Association, told CNBC in a recent interview.In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland this spring, the AGA asked the Justice Department to investigate well-known offshore gambling sites, which it said are openly violating federal and state laws and brazenly paying for advertising that targets U.S. gamblers.Then on June 29, more than two dozen members of Congress also sent a letter calling on the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute illegal offshore sportsbooks.The Justice Department has not yet responded to the AGA's letter or to CNBC's request for comment.The challenge for the gaming industry has escalated as online searches for offshore sportsbooks last year rose faster than searches for the regulated operators, according to the AGA. More than half of gamblers say they still wager using offshore sites like Bovada, MyBookie and BetOnline, according to a survey by the association.""There are hundreds of illegal or unregulated operators who are taking sports bets every single day. We estimate there's potentially $15 billion going through some of these offshore operators,"" FanDuel CEO Amy Howe told CNBC.Legal operators including FanDuel, owned by Flutter, DraftKings, Caesars and BetMGM, co-owned by MGM Resorts and Entain, spend billions of dollars on licensing, marketing and lobbying for the legalization of sports betting in new states.The companies say offshore operators compete for customers without having to invest in licensing or lobbying or paying state and local taxes.""It gives them an unfair competitive advantage. They can offer better odds to the consumer,"" Howe said. She added that many players don't even know when they're using illegal betting sites. Some gamblers used offshore bookies for years before the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 2018 and cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting. New Jersey gambler Justin Wunderler said he used to bet on sports through offshore sites, starting in high school, when that was the only option for sports wagering. Since then, he's been burned a number of times when he couldn't withdraw money from the offshore bookies.""I got kind of screwed,"" he said. ""They ran away with my winnings, and that's it. Sometimes bookies don't pay out when you win.""Howe said unregulated sites frequently ignore the responsible gambling safeguards U.S. operators have in place to maintain their licenses. She said 25% of FanDuel's customers who switch from illegal operators do so because they weren't paid their winnings.Yet some experienced gamblers continue to use unregulated sites, drawn by more advantageous odds or promotions or because the sites let high rollers bet on credit. Plus, some frequent gamblers might find their bet limits restricted at legal sportsbooks in the U.S.Wunderler said the offshore sites allow far higher limits, including for the ""sharks,"" who are experienced, savvy gamblers. ""Some of them could go up to $50,000, while some of these legal sites you can only bet $120,"" he said.In states that have legalized sports betting, online searches for offshore betting sites have declined, according to the gaming association. But the offshore site Bovada still accounts for half of sports-betting-related searches nationwide, the AGA told CNBC.Miller of the AGA said the gaming industry is looking to partner with Google and other internet search engines to stop turning up results with illegal sites. The casino industry is also asking law enforcement to crackdown on unlicensed gambling machines, often found in taverns, mini-marts and gas stations. They look, sound and play like slot machines, but the manufacturers label them ""skills-based"" games to avoid gambling regulations.""Why that matters is they're not tested. There's no quality assurance around odds,"" said Miller. And if the machines don't pay out, he said there's rarely accountability from the host location.Aristocrat manufactures the popular Buffalo slot machines, as well as many others, that are licensed in 300 U.S. jurisdictions. Its CEO, Hector Fernandez, said unregulated manufacturers have stolen designs and other intellectual property from the company.Fernandez said he's also concerned about the lack of consumer protections with unregulated games.The industry is working to educate players about unregulated operators, although it says that it can be difficult to tell the difference between legal and illegal operators.""Educating the public that is generally unaware of whether they're betting on illegal sites or illegal sites is a job for all of us,"" Miller said.Disclosure: CNBC parent Comcast and NBC Sports are investors in FanDuel."
2022-07-07,"Electric vehicle manufacturing is a major battleground as states vie for leadership in rebuilding the U.S. supply chain.Southern states including Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky have won major plants with Ford, Rivian, Hyundai, and Volkswagen by offering huge incentives.Not to be outdone, Michigan is trying to retain its status as the automotive capital by offering hefty incentives of its own, including a $1 billion deal with GM. For as long as there has been an auto industry, Michigan has been its epicenter. But now, the industry is making clear that it is not bound by tradition.The move to electric vehicles — rapidly accelerating as the price of fossil fuels rises and battery technology improves — is easily the biggest shakeup in the industry since mass production began in Michigan at the start of the 20th century. And it has left Michigan's status as the nation's automotive capital deeply in jeopardy.Startups including Amazon-backed Rivian and VinFast from Vietnam are spending billions to build factories in the Southeast — Georgia and North Carolina, respectively. Korea's Hyundai has announced that it will set up shop in Georgia. Volkswagen has a massive facility in Tennessee and is looking to expand there.But Michigan took a body blow last year when one of its most iconic companies — Ford — announced it would spend $11.4 billion to build a manufacturing complex dubbed ""Blue Oval City"" in Tennessee, and a pair of battery plants nearby in Kentucky. The company says the expansion will create nearly 11,000 jobs. ""No one wants to see that, right?"" said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in an interview. ""I mean, it was kind of a shock.""It was enough of a shock to get Whitmer, a Democrat, and the Republican-controlled state legislature to agree in record time on a package of incentives aimed at matching the deals that helped other states win EV manufacturers. Georgia is doling out $1.5 billion in state and local incentives to Rivian, for example. North Carolina agreed to pay up to $1.2 billion to lure VinFast. Ford stands to collect $883 million from Tennessee and another $250 million from Kentucky.So, in December, just weeks after Ford's bombshell announcement, Whitmer signed a package of legislation including a new $1 billion incentive fund for ""strategic outreach and attraction.""If anyone in Michigan is annoyed about having to put up that kind of money just to retain an industry that is already there, they are not showing it.""It's my job to make sure that we've got all of the resources we can focus, so that we are competitive with what other states are throwing at these companies to try to earn their investment,"" Whitmer said.Sure enough, another homegrown Michigan company, General Motors, happily took the bait.In January, GM announced it would spend $7 billion to expand its electric vehicle business in the state, including a new battery plant in a joint venture with South Korea's LG Energy Solution, and expanding GM's electric vehicle production at its Lake Orion, Michigan, assembly plant. That work had been slated to be done in Mexico.In exchange, GM stands to collect around $1 billion in incentives, including $600 million from the new incentive fund.""The future of mobility is very much happening in the state of Michigan,"" Whitmer said.The head of the state's economic development arm said the new incentives will help bolster Michigan's sales pitch as it tries to win more business.""Michigan is a state that put the world on wheels, created Motown, tremendous advances in the life sciences and medical devices. We're still that state of inventiveness,"" said Quentin L. Messer, Jr., CEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. But one site selection consultant, who says he worked on several electric vehicle deals, warns that most of the big deals have already been done.""I think we are at peak EV in terms of the frenzy,"" said Tom Stringer, managing director in charge of the site selection and incentives practice at BDO in New York. ""I think you see this reflected in the stock prices. The froth is off the market. Now, it's 'prove it.' Do customers want these vehicles? Can these manufacturers go to scale and deliver?""Stringer said that all the states have been careful to structure their incentives so the companies must first create the jobs before they can cash in.""There have been no giveaways in this industry, which is great for from a taxpayer standpoint,"" he said.Still, subsidy watchdog Greg LeRoy of the nonprofit group Good Jobs First believes states have gotten caught up in the hype, to the potential detriment of the taxpayers.""It's understandable, governors want to get in on the ground floor of a rising industry, electric vehicles, in the future."" But, he said, ""spending a billion dollars on a single facility, you're never going to break even from a tax revenue point of view."" Another Michigan institution with a major stake in the EV battle between the states is the United Auto Workers.""We're headquartered here, we were founded here,"" said UAW President Ray Curry in an interview. ""We're always going to advocate for Michigan. It's always about the home team.""Regardless, the union is still seeking to organize the facilities in less union-friendly states. It has had some successes, including at Ford's Blue Oval City complex. But most of the other plants, like Rivian in Georgia, are non-union.Even in Michigan, there are no guarantees. GM's battery joint venture, called Ultium Cells, is non-union, at least for now. Curry is vowing to change that.""It's a very critical time for the UAW,"" he said. ""This transformation piece is about our future. It's about 86-plus years of longstanding history.""Messer, the state economic development official, believes Michigan's deep union history may have hurt the state due to what he said are misconceptions among business leaders.""The unions have been very focused on talent development, workforce development, getting young people into the trades,"" he said. ""These are critically important things that I think people don't appreciate.""Stringer said many companies are taking a new look at unions, no longer strictly as adversaries, but also as sources of badly needed talent.""I think the ability to get skilled workers, whether they're union or non-union, is critical,"" he said. ""If unionized states can show that value proposition, that if you hire our individuals, they're going to be better, faster, more effective over the long term, those states are winning projects."" "
2022-07-08,"The price of bitcoin got a small relief bounce this week as investors hoped that the worst of the crypto liquidity crisis is over.By Friday, bitcoin had risen 13.63% for the seven-day trading week beginning Sunday, and was on pace for its best week since October, according to Coin Metrics. The price rose as high as $22,478.37 at one point, climbing back from a low of about $17,000 in June.It last traded less than 1% higher on the day at $21,798.40, at 4:00 p.m. ET, according to CoinMetrics.""A lot of the insolvencies and forced unwinding from a volume perspective are behind us,"" said Felix Hartmann, managing partner of Hartmann Capital. ""Three Arrows filing for bankruptcy was kind of the final pin in that.""Three Arrows, a crypto-focused hedge fund, filed for bankruptcy last week after a sharp decline in digital currency prices exposed a liquidity crisis at the firm.The market contagion could spread into smaller crypto exchanges or funds, Hartmann added, but there aren't any bigger, more impactful dominoes left to fall. If the crypto industry can go a month without bad news or insolvencies, he said, it's ""very likely"" that that market could double. Loading chart... Still, doing so would only lift bitcoin's price back up to April levels. It's currently about 70% below its November all-time high of $68,982.20. Gritt Trakulhoon, lead crypto analyst at Titan, called bitcoin's weekly rise a ""much needed"" short-term relief rally coming after a major capitulation going back to May when Terra's stablecoin project crumbled. Indeed, as digital currency prices tumbled and strained liquidity, crypto lenders and other firms have also suffered.Having an unofficial lender of last resort like Sam Bankman-Fried to bail out some of the embattled crypto lenders is also providing relief to investors, Trakulhoon added. This week, the FTX CEO said he and his company still have a ""few billion"" on hand to shore up struggling firms that could further destabilize the digital asset industry.Trakulhoon said $22,500 to $23,000 is the resistance level to watch for bitcoin. If it breaks above that threshold, it should rise ""pretty quickly"" to its next stop: $28,000, he added.Ryan Shea, economist at Trakx, pointed to this week's news that Federal Reserve officials said another interest rate hike of 50 or 75 basis points is likely at their July meeting. That, combined with increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing more markedly than policymakers' projections, is making investors view the Fed's aggressive stance ""with more circumspection,"" he said.""In effect, they are looking through the hikes and instead are focused on the expectation of eventual Fed capitulation, something that is a positive scenario for crypto prices, and risk assets more generally,"" Shea said."
2022-07-08,"Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said Friday that regulation is needed or the industry could become a wider danger to the financial system.The lack of regulation guidelines has been a confusing and troublesome issue for the crypto industry.Despite this year's crash in the price of bitcoin, U.S. regulators continue to call attention to the industry's potential, growth and reach, as well as the potential consequences of not having a clear framework for it. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard became the latest official to speak out on crypto, saying Friday that regulation is needed or the industry could become a wider danger.""Innovation has the potential to make financial services faster, cheaper and more inclusive, and to do so in ways that are native to the digital ecosystem,"" she said in a speech at a Bank of England conference in London. ""It is important that the foundations for sound regulation of the crypto financial system be established now before the crypto ecosystem becomes so large or interconnected that it might pose risks to the stability of the broader financial system.""The lack of regulation guidelines has been a confusing and troublesome issue for the crypto industry, whose participants are keen to develop and expand businesses but are unclear on the regulatory parameters within which they can do so.Despite this year's crash — the price of bitcoin is currently about 70% below its November all-time high of $68,982.20 — U.S. regulators continue to call attention to the industry's potential, growth and reach, as well as the potential consequences of not having a clear framework for it.Brainard's comments come a month after Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation to create a regulatory framework for crypto that would empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate most of the industry.Earlier this year, President Joe Biden announced an executive order on cryptocurrencies that attempted to fix the lack of a framework for crypto development in the U.S.Brainard on Friday highlighted the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices.She also pointed to recent events that have further pressured crypto prices and soured sentiment, specifically the collapse of Terra, as well as attempts to create decentralized stablecoins and the current liquidity crisis involving Three Arrows Capital.""New technology and financial engineering cannot by themselves convert risky assets into safe ones,"" Brainard said.""Despite significant investor losses, the crypto financial system does not yet appear to be so large or so interconnected with the traditional financial system as to pose a systemic risk,"" she added. ""This is the right time to establish which crypto activities are permissible for regulated entities and under what constraints so that spillovers to the core financial system remain well contained."""
2022-07-08,"Crypto lender Celsius artificially inflated the price of its own digital coin, failed to hedge risk and engaged in activities that amounted to fraud, a lawsuit alleges.Celsius on Thursday was sued by former investment manager Jason Stone, as pressure continues to mount on the firm amid a crash in cryptocurrency prices.Stone alleges in the lawsuit that Celsius was running a ""Ponzi scheme."" Crypto lender Celsius artificially inflated the price of its own digital coin, failed to hedge risk and engaged in activities that amounted to fraud, a lawsuit alleges.Celsius on Thursday was sued by former investment manager Jason Stone, as pressure continues to mount on the firm amid a crash in cryptocurrency prices.The lawsuit in New York state court comes after Celsius, which offers customers interest for depositing their crypto, was forced to pause withdrawals for its users as it faces a liquidity crisis.Celsius was not immediately available for comment on the lawsuit when contacted by CNBC. Celsius acts like a bank in that it offers customers yield, sometimes as high as nearly 19%, if they deposit their crypto with the company. The firm then lends that crypto out to others willing to pay a high interest rate to borrow. Then it tries to pocket that money in order to give the yield back to customers.Stone founded a company called KeyFi which specialized in crypto trading strategies. Celsius and KeyFi cut a ""handshake deal"" whereby the latter firm would ""manage billions of dollars in customer crypto-deposits in return for a share of the profits generated from those crypto-deposits,"" the lawsuit alleges.There was ""no formal written agreement between the parties,"" the lawsuit said.From August 2020, Celsius began ""transferring hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto-assets"" to Stone and his team, according to the lawsuit. Celsius set up a wallet on the Ethereum blockchain referred to as ""0xb1."" That's where the company sent the assets Stone was to deploy, the lawsuit claims. Stone makes a number of allegations against Celsius in the lawsuit.Celsius and Stone decided to engage in crypto trading strategies that required an effective hedging strategy to manage risk and guard against price fluctuations of certain digital coins, the lawsuit alleges. It adds that Celsius had full view of what trading activities KeyFi was engaging in.Stone claims Celsius executives ""repeatedly assured"" him that the company had entered the necessary hedging transactions to ensure price fluctuations of certain crypto assets would not materially and negatively impact the company or its ability to repay depositors. Stone and his team relied on these representations, the lawsuit adds.""But these promises were lies. Despite its repeated assurances, Celsius failed to implement basic risk management strategies to protect against the risks of price fluctuation that were inherent in many of the deployed investment strategies,"" the lawsuit claims.Stone alleges there were ""multiple incidents"" in which Celsius' ""failure to perform basic accounting endangered customer funds.""Another allegation revolves around the digital coin called CEL. That is Celsius' own token. Celsius says that if users accept their interest payment in the form of CEL, they could earn higher interest than those who don't.The lawsuit alleges, however, that Celsius engaged in transactions to artificially inflate the price of CEL.""The purpose of this scheme was both fraudulent and illegal: Celsius induced customers to be paid in CEL tokens by providing them with higher interest rates,"" the lawsuit claims. ""Then by purposefully and artificially inflating the price of the CEL token, Celsius was able pay customers who had elected to receive their interest payments in the form of the CEL token even less of the crypto-asset.""Stone also alleges that Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky was ""able to enrich himself considerably."" Finally, Stone claims in the lawsuit that Celsius was running a ""Ponzi scheme.""Because of Celsius' failure to hedge against trading risks, it had ""massive liabilities"" to depositors denominated in the cryptocurrency ether but had not maintained holdings in that digital coin equal to those liabilities, the lawsuit claims.As customers sought to withdraw either deposits, Celsius was forced to buy more ether in the open market at high prices (around January 2021) and suffered heavy losses, the lawsuit claims. Stone alleges that Celsius then began to offer double-digit interest rates in order to lure in new depositors whose funds were used to repay earlier depositors and creditors.""Thus, while Celsius continued to market itself as a transparent and well capitalized business, in reality, it had become a Ponzi scheme,"" the lawsuit claims. Stone left Celsius in March 2021. He claims in the lawsuit that at the time of his departure Celsius had a $100 million to $200 million hole in its balance sheet that ""it could not fully explain or resolve.""He claims that Celsius maintains control of the ""0xb1"" Ethereum wallet and that the CEO of Celsius uses it ""for his own personal benefit.""In one instance, Stone alleges, Mashinsky transferred valuable non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, from the accounts to his wife's wallet."
2022-07-12,"Lawyers representing 3AC's creditors say the physical whereabouts of Zhu Su and Kyle Davies are ""currently unknown.""The court filing from Friday also alleges that the founders have not yet begun to cooperate with the liquidation process ""in any meaningful manner."" The co-founders of failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital appear to be on the run from creditors, according to court documents recently filed in New York.Lawyers representing the creditors say the physical whereabouts of Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, who started Three Arrows in 2012, are ""currently unknown,"" ahead of a hearing that is scheduled for 9 a.m. ET on Tuesday to discuss next steps in the liquidation process. The documents, filed Friday evening, also allege that the founders have not yet begun to cooperate with the liquidation process ""in any meaningful manner."" On Monday, lawyers requested the court keep the identity of the creditors anonymous.Zhu and Davies did not respond to requests for comment.Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, managed about $10 billion in assets as recently as March. On July 1, the firm filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection from U.S. creditors in the Southern District of New York, after a plunge in cryptocurrencies and the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin project wiped out its assets.Prior to the bankruptcy filing, a court in the British Virgin Islands ordered the beleaguered fund to liquidate in order to pay back its debts. Now, 3AC is in bankruptcy court, facing angry lenders who want their money back. Global advisory firm Teneo was hired to help manage the liquidation, starting with trying to determine what was left.According to Friday's court filing, Zhu and Davies, both former traders for Credit Suisse, participated in an introductory Zoom call last week to discuss basic steps to preserve their assets. Neither founder turned on his video, and both remained muted for the duration, with all dialogue conducted through counsel. Their lawyers said at the time that they ""intended to cooperate.""During the meeting, representatives helping to facilitate the liquidation requested immediate access to 3AC's offices and to information related to their bank accounts and digital wallets. As of Friday, that access had not been granted, the filing says.When the fund's liquidators previously arrived at 3AC's Singapore office in late June in an attempt to meet with the founders, ""the offices appeared vacant except for a number of inactive computer screens.""The filing notes that while the office door was locked, the representatives could view unopened mail addressed to Three Arrows, which ""appeared to have been pushed under the door or propped against the door."" Neighbors in surrounding offices said they had last seen people in the 3AC office in early June.Meanwhile, creditors are trying to determine what assets remain.Teneo's Russell Crumpler, who was tasked with helping to facilitate the bankruptcy process, said in a sworn statement that there is a ""real risk"" that 3AC's assets would disappear ""absent immediate authority to pursue discovery.""""That risk is heightened because a substantial portion of the Debtor's assets are comprised of cash and digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens, that are readily transferrable,"" Crumpler said in his statement.There are reasons for such concern. One of 3AC's NFTs was transferred to another crypto wallet, according to a well-known NFT collector and investor.In Friday's filing, creditors requested that the court suspend 3AC's right to transfer or dispose of any assets. Attorneys are also asking that the court subpoena the founders or others who may have information about 3AC's assets. That could include banks, crypto exchanges and counterparties.3AC's insolvency has already had a major impact on the broader crypto market, because so many institutions had money wrapped up with the firm.Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after 3AC couldn't pay back the roughly $670 million it had borrowed from the company. U.S.-based crypto lenders Genesis and BlockFi, crypto derivatives platform BitMEX and crypto exchange FTX are also being hit with losses.— CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.

2022-07-12,"""Despite hype as digital gold, cryptocurrencies have failed to demonstrate either 'safe haven' or inflation-fighting properties when faced with actual market volatility or the first real bout of serious inflation in developed markets.""""Cryptocurrencies remain deeply problematic from an environmental, social and governance perspective.""""A digital dollar, euro or sterling would provide all the functionality of stablecoins — but with almost no liquidity or credit risk."" With more than $1 trillion in cryptocurrency value wiped out since the 2021 high-water mark, many investors may be tempted to enter the cryptocurrency orbit at a potentially attractive, lower price point.After all, previous dramatic drawdowns in cryptocurrency valuations have been followed by explosive growth — and all this volatility could be justified as the expectedly bumpy price discovery process of an important brand-new asset class.related investing newsCrypto sees fifth consecutive week of outflows, with negative sentiment focused on bitcoinTanaya Macheel16 hours agoHowever, the most profound risks to cryptocurrency investing may lie ahead, rather than in the rear-view mirror. Investors contemplating a long-term allocation to cryptocurrencies should remain wary for five primary reasons. After a dazzling first decade, bitcoin has become a somewhat troubled teenager. In its heady early days, bitcoin had near-zero correlation with broad equities and commodities, providing the potential for true portfolio diversification.However, as cryptocurrency investing has become more mainstream, and especially since 2020, bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities and bonds has spiked sharply and remained consistently positive. That might be fine if bitcoin offered spectacular risk-adjusted returns as compensation. Unfortunately, recent empirical evidence shows otherwise: Since 2018, bitcoin's risk-adjusted return has been quite unremarkable compared to equities and bonds. Despite all the hype as digital gold, cryptocurrencies have failed to demonstrate either ""safe haven"" or inflation-fighting properties when faced with actual market volatility or the first real bout of serious inflation in developed markets.Between 2010 and 2022, bitcoin recorded 27 episodes of drawdowns of 25% or more. By comparison, equities and commodities recorded just one each. Even in the pandemic-related market selloff of March 2020, bitcoin suffered significantly deeper drawdowns than conventional asset classes like equities or bonds.More from Personal Finance:This former financial advisor pivoted to teach advisors about crypto80% of socially responsible ESG investors also own cryptocurrencySome experts say a recession is coming. Here’s how to prepare your portfolioSimilarly, while the fixed supply of bitcoin — hardcoded into its blockchain — might imply a resistance to monetary debasement, in the recent episodes of elevated global inflation, bitcoin has provided limited inflation protection with prices tumbling even as inflation spikes in the U.S., U.K. and Europe. Cryptocurrencies remain deeply problematic from an environmental, social and governance, or ESG, perspective. That's true even if the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake that blockchain-based software platform ethereum is spearheading reduces the massive energy consumption underpinning crypto mining and validation.Environmentally, bitcoin — which represents more than 40% of current cryptocurrency market cap — will continue to use a validation process where a single transaction requires enough energy to power the average American home for two months.Socially, cryptocurrencies' promise of financial inclusiveness also appears overblown, with crypto wealth as unequally distributed as conventional wealth, and with simple phone-based payment services such as M-Pesa in Kenya or Grameen Bank's international remittance pilots in Bangladesh already providing a digital platform for underbanked households — without the need for a new currency or payment infrastructure. Most troublingly for investors with ESG goals, however, are the governance issues with cryptocurrencies whose decentralized frameworks and anonymity make them especially attractive for illicit activity, money laundering and sanction evasion.The increased trading between ruble and cryptocurrencies following sanctions on Russia after the Ukraine war suggest that the evasion of financial sanctions is not just a theoretical concern. Market manipulation is another area of governance concern, especially with celebrity crypto influencers who can send market prices soaring or tumbling with impunity. Even putting aside the recent implosion of the Terra stablecoin, the surviving universe of stablecoins face a potentially existential risk: They could well be made redundant once central bank digital currencies, also called CBDCs, become commonplace. This is because a digital dollar, euro or sterling would provide all the functionality of stablecoins — but with almost no liquidity or credit risk.In other words, even if stablecoins transformed from their current status as unregulated money market funds (with limited transparency into or auditing of reserves) into regulated digital tokens, they would afford no benefit over CBDCs. Importantly, these central bank digital currencies may not a distant prospect. China has already launched an electronic currency known as the digital yuan, or e-CNY. The Fed released a long-awaited study on a digital dollar at the start of 2022, and the ECB will share its findings on the viability of a digital euro in 2023. Finally, a lack of clear and uniform cryptocurrency regulation — both within and across countries — creates tremendous uncertainty for long-term investors. It is still unclear in the U.S., for example, when a cryptocurrency falls under the regulatory framework of a security subject to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and when it is deemed to be an asset or commodity like bitcoin and ether have claimed.Indeed, in some countries, cryptocurrencies are facing outright prohibition. China's abrupt banning of all cryptocurrency trading and mining in 2021 is a prominent example, but by no means the only one. Regulators have also been concerned with the notable and repeated breakdowns in the infrastructure supporting cryptocurrency mining and trading — another area where there remains significant regulatory uncertainty.Of course, momentum, retail speculation, and the ""fear of missing out"" may continue to drive up the short-term price of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies. But there are enough dark clouds on the cryptocurrency horizon that long-term investors may want to observe carefully from the sidelines to better understand fact vs. fiction and true value versus social media hype before deciding how, where and if to invest in the crypto ecosystem.— By Taimur Hyat, chief operating officer of PGIM."
2022-07-12,"A federal judge in a New York bankruptcy court has frozen the remaining assets of once-prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York granted the emergency motion during a court hearing on Tuesday. A federal judge in a New York bankruptcy court has frozen the remaining assets of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital following the firm's rapid fall from prominence.The fund, founded nearly a decade ago, managed $10 billion in assets just a few months ago. Now, its two co-founders are in hiding from angry creditors, who are trying to recoup some of their losses. Prior to the bankruptcy filing, a court in the British Virgin Islands ordered the beleaguered fund to liquidate in order to pay back its debts.Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York granted the emergency motion on Tuesday to freeze Three Arrows' assets. CNBC joined a court hearing, which covered next steps in the bankruptcy process.Glenn noted in the written decision that only the assigned bankruptcy liquidators have the authority to ""transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the Debtor located within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.""As part of Glenn's ruling, global advisory firm Teneo, which was assigned to manage the liquidation, was also granted permission to subpoena Three Arrows co-founders Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, as well as banks, crypto exchanges and other institutions and firms that have done business with the firm. The chief concern is that Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, and its leadership team might be siphoning funds ahead of the formal liquidation. Coindesk reported that Zhu is looking to sell his $35 million Singapore property, and there are reports of at least one other digital asset transfer of a non-fungible token held by the fund.""A key part of this motion is to put the world on notice that it is the liquidators that are controlling the debtor's assets at this stage,"" Adam Goldberg, an attorney representing Teneo, said in Tuesday's hearing.Zhu and Davies didn't respond to requests for comment. Their lawyer, Christopher Anand Daniel of Singapore-based Advocatus Law, also didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment.Goldberg, of law firm Latham & Watkins, said liquidators are looking for documents such as account statements and digital wallet information.A main reason for the aggressive action is that the physical whereabouts of Zhu and Davies are ""currently unknown,"" according to lawyers representing the creditors. The creditors also allege that liquidators in Singapore found that 3AC's offices were vacant, save for a few inactive computer screens.But after a nearly month-long hiatus from Twitter, Zhu broke his silence on Twitter early Tuesday, writing that the firm's efforts to cooperate with creditors had been met with ""baiting.""From his verified account, Zhu shared screengrabs of emails sent by his lawyer to counsel representing liquidators. In those messages, the attorney wrote that the families of the co-founders ""have received threats of physical violence."" He also said Zhu and Davies have been ""working under a lot of time pressure,"" noting that they ""had to field queries from the Monetary Authority of Singapore in the last week.""In the email, Daniel, their attorney, said he attached a spreadsheet with details of the company's assets and said they would be providing additional information about the firm's assets ""on a rolling basis.""CNBC asked Daniel for the spreadsheet, but didn't hear back. Goldberg said during the hearing that the information provided to his team is ""by no means a sufficient form of cooperation.""Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures, which invests in blockchain-based companies, said the process could ultimately take years.""I wouldn't hold my breath to see the situation resolved,"" said Carter. ""I'd be extremely concerned about dispositions of assets and trying to extricate them or maybe expropriate assets that are owed to creditors, and siphon those out of the process for the personal usage of the principles here.""Carter said the case is particularly complex because it involves entities in Dubai, Singapore and other offshore locations.""The level of coordination that's required in order to unify the legal process here is very significant,"" Carter said.— CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report."

Crypto company Celsius has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after a month of turmoil. In a Wednesday statement, Celsius said it would look to stabilize its business by restructuring in a way ""that maximizes value for all stakeholders.""

""I am confident that when we look back at the history of Celsius, we will see this as a defining moment, where acting with resolve and confidence served the community and strengthened the future of the company.""The Hoboken, New Jersey-based company made headlines a month ago after freezing customer accounts, blaming ""extreme market conditions.""Wednesday's news marks the latest high-profile crypto bankruptcy as prices plummet.Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week, after suffering losses due to exposure to now defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. A judge in New York bankruptcy court froze Three Arrows Capital's remaining assets this week. The fund is now in the process of liquidation proceedings. ""Unfortunately, this was expected. It was anticipated. It does not, however, stop our investigations. We will continue investigating the company and working to protect its clients, even through its insolvency,"" Joseph Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board, said of the Celsius bankruptcy filing.Celsius did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The company has more than 100,000 creditors, which could include both customers and lending counterparties, according to the bankruptcy document. Its largest unsecured claim is an $81 million from Caymans Island-based Pharos Fund. The filing also lists billionaire FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research, as a creditor with a $12 million unsecured loan.Celsius was one of the largest players in the crypto lending space with more than $8 billion in loans to clients, and almost $12 billion in assets under management as of May. Celsius said it had 1.7 million customers as of June and was competing with its interest-bearing accounts and yields as high as 17%.The firm would lend customers' crypto out to counterparties willing to pay a sky-high interest rates to borrow it. Celsius would then split some of that revenue with users. But the structure came crashing down amid a liquidity crunch in the industry. The company was sued last week by a former investment manager who alleged Celsius failed to hedge risk, artificially inflated the price of its own digital coin, and engaged in activities that amounted to fraud.Six state regulators have already launched investigations into Celsius. Vermont became the latest to do so earlier on Wednesday. The state's Department of Financial Regulation said Celsius ""deployed customer assets in a variety of risky and illiquid investments, trading, and lending activities.""""Celsius customers did not receive critical disclosures about its financial condition, investing activities, risk factors, and ability to repay its obligations to depositors and other creditors,"" the Vermont regulator said in a statement. ""The company's assets and investments are probably inadequate to cover its outstanding obligations.""Adam Levitin, Georgetown law professor and principal at Gordian Crypto Advisors, said Celsius customers may have to wait years to see their money again and may only be entitled to pennies on the dollar. Customers that took part in Celsius's high-yield deposit program could be seen as unsecured creditors in the eyes of the court.""The treatment here seems to be that the customer's crypto is actually the company's property, and as an unsecured creditor, you don't get your bitcoins back,"" Levitin told CNBC, adding that he doesn't think Celsius is the last of the crypto bankruptcies. ""The tide is still going out, we're just waiting to see how far it goes."""
2022-07-13,"Finance carries inherent risks, and while technology can change the way these risks are managed and distributed, it cannot eliminate them, says Bank of England Deputy Governer Jon Cunliffe.Bitcoin has fallen more than 70% from its record high hit in November and was trading below $20,000 on Wednesday, its lowest level since December 2020, according to CoinDesk data.The extension of regulatory framework to encompass crypto ""must be grounded in the iron principle of 'same risk, same regulatory outcome.'""  Regulators need to ""get on with the job"" of bringing the use of crypto technologies within the ""regulatory perimeter,"" says Jon Cunliffe, Bank of England's deputy governor for financial stability.Speaking at the British High Commissioner's residence in Singapore on Tuesday, Cunliffe shared insights on the recent ""crypto winter,"" which refers to a period of falling crypto prices that remain low for an long time.Finance carries inherent risks, and while technology can change the way risks are managed and distributed, it cannot eliminate them, he added.""Financial assets with no intrinsic value … are only worth what the next buyer will pay. They are therefore inherently volatile, very vulnerable to sentiment and prone to collapse,"" said Cunliffe. Bitcoin has fallen more than 70% from its record high hit in November and was trading below $20,000 on Wednesday, its lowest level since December 2020, according to CoinDesk data.As investors dumped crypto amid a broader sell-off in risk assets, the market cap of crypto fell below $1 trillion, down from $3 trillion at its peak in November.Cryptocurrencies may not be ""integrated enough"" into the rest of the financial system to be an ""immediate systemic risk,"" Cunliffe said, but he said he suspects the boundaries between the crypto world and the traditional financial system will ""increasingly become blurred."" ""The interesting question for regulators is not what will happen next to the value of crypto assets, but what do we need to do to ensure that ... prospective innovation … can happen without giving rise to increasing and potentially systemic risks."" Regulators have increasingly been sounding the alarm about crypto, and Cunliffe said the extension of a regulatory framework to encompass crypto ""must be grounded in the iron principle of 'same risk, same regulatory outcome.'""""For example, if a stablecoin is being used as a 'settlement asset' in transactions … it must be as safe as the other forms of money,"" he said.Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that are supposed to track a real world asset, usually another currency. Many of them attempt to peg themselves one-to-one with the U.S. dollar or another fiat currency. Some of them are backed by real-world assets such as bonds or currencies.They were designed to offer a sound store of value to minimize price volatility. However, the collapse of terraUSD (UST) — a so-called ""algorithmic"" stablecoin that's pegged to the U.S. dollar — sent shockwaves through crypto markets. Unlike other stablecoins, terraUSD was not backed by real assets. Instead, it was governed by an algorithm which attempted to peg it one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. That algorithm failed. The holders of such stablecoins must have a clear legal claim that enables them to redeem the coin within the day and ""in par, with no loss of value"" in central or commercial bank money, Cunliffe said.""Needless to say, such a requirement is a long way from the world of Terra and Luna,"" he said, referring to TerraUSD, which plunged as low as 26 cents even though it's meant to maintain a one-to-one U.S. dollar peg.Its sister token Luna, which has a floating price and is meant to serve as a kind of shock absorber for UST, also lost nearly all of its value.""Implicit in our regulatory standards and frameworks are the levels of risk mitigation we have judged necessary. Where we cannot apply regulation in exactly the same way, we must ensure we achieve the same level of risk mitigation.""He recommended that the activities be halted ""if and when for certain crypto related activities this proves not to be possible."" The Bank of England official said that for the ""same risk, same regulatory outcome"" approach to be effective, it needs to be carried forward across international standards and incorporated into domestic regulatory regimes.The U.K. Financial Stability Board will publish a consultation report later this year with recommendations for promoting international consistency in regulatory approaches to non-stablecoin crypto assets, markets and exchanges, he added.Innovators, regulators and public authorities have an interest in developing appropriate regulation and managing risks, he said.""It is only within such a framework, that [innovators] can really flourish and that the benefits of technological change can be secured,"" Cunliffe added."

2022-07-14,"Cryptocurrencies have suffered a brutal comedown this year, losing $2 trillion in value since the height of a massive rally in 2021.While there are parallels between today’s meltdown and crashes past, a lot has changed since the last major bear market in crypto.The crypto market has been flooded with debt thanks to the emergence of centralized lending schemes and so-called “decentralized finance.”The collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and the contagion effect from the liquidation of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, highlighted how interconnected projects and companies were in this cycle.  The two words on every crypto investor's lips right now are undoubtedly ""crypto winter.""Cryptocurrencies have suffered a brutal comedown this year, losing $2 trillion in value since the height of a massive rally in 2021.related investing newsMorgan Stanley sees a sign that points to a top in bitcoinTanaya Macheel11 hours agoIt’s been a month since the big Shapella upgrade. Here’s how Ethereum has changed since thenTanaya Macheela day agoBitcoin, the world's biggest digital coin, is off 70% from a November all-time high of nearly $69,000.That's resulted in many experts warning of a prolonged bear market known as ""crypto winter."" The last such event occurred between 2017 and 2018.But there's something about the latest crash that makes it different from previous downturns in crypto — the latest cycle has been marked by a series of events that have caused contagion across the industry because of their interconnected nature and business strategies. Back in 2018, bitcoin and other tokens slumped sharply after a steep climb in 2017.The market then was awash with so-called initial coin offerings, where people poured money into crypto ventures that had popped up left, right and center — but the vast majority of those projects ended up failing.""The 2017 crash was largely due to the burst of a hype bubble,"" Clara Medalie, research director at crypto data firm Kaiko, told CNBC.But the current crash began earlier this year as a result of macroeconomic factors including rampant inflation that has caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to hike interest rates. These factors weren't present in the last cycle.Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market more broadly has been trading in a closely correlated fashion to other risk assets, in particular stocks. Bitcoin posted its worst quarter in more than a decade in the second quarter of the year. In the same period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 22%.That sharp reversal of the market caught many in the industry from hedge funds to lenders off guard. Another difference is there weren't big Wall Street players using ""highly leveraged positions"" back in 2017 and 2018, according to Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University.For sure, there are parallels between today's meltdown and crashes past — the most significant being seismic losses suffered by novice traders who got lured into crypto by promises of lofty returns.But a lot has changed since the last major bear market.So how did we get here? TerraUSD, or UST, was an algorithmic stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that was supposed to be pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. It worked via a complex mechanism governed by an algorithm. But UST lost its dollar peg which led to the collapse of its sister token luna too.This sent shockwaves through the crypto industry but also had knock-on effects to companies exposed to UST, in particular hedge fund Three Arrows Capital or 3AC (more on them later). ""The collapse of the Terra blockchain and UST stablecoin was widely unexpected following a period of immense growth,"" Medalie said. Crypto investors built up huge amounts of leverage thanks to the emergence of centralized lending schemes and so-called ""decentralized finance,"" or DeFi, an umbrella term for financial products developed on the blockchain.But the nature of leverage has been different in this cycle versus the last. In 2017, leverage was largely provided to retail investors via derivatives on cryptocurrency exchanges, according to Martin Green, CEO of quant trading firm Cambrian Asset Management.When the crypto markets declined in 2018, those positions opened by retail investors were automatically liquidated on exchanges as they couldn't meet margin calls, which exacerbated the selling.""In contrast, the leverage that caused the forced selling in Q2 2022 had been provided to crypto funds and lending institutions by retail depositors of crypto who were investing for yield,"" said Green. ""2020 onwards saw a huge build out of yield-based DeFi and crypto 'shadow banks.'""""There was a lot of unsecured or undercollateralized lending as credit risks and counterparty risks were not assessed with vigilance. When market prices declined in Q2 of this year, funds, lenders and others became forced sellers because of margins calls.""

Here's where analysts see it heading next.These tech stocks have never been more compelling, Goldman Sachs saysBank of America says this chip stock is the best way to play the electric vehicle transition A margin call is a situation in which an investor has to commit more funds to avoid losses on a trade made with borrowed cash.The inability to meet margin calls has led to further contagion. At the heart of the recent turmoil in crypto assets is the exposure of numerous crypto firms to risky bets that were vulnerable to ""attack,"" including terra, Sussex University's Alexander said.It's worth looking at how some of this contagion has played out via some high-profile examples.Celsius, a company that offered users yields of more than 18% for depositing their crypto with the firm, paused withdrawals for customers last month. Celsius acted sort of like a bank. It would take the deposited crypto and lend it out to other players at a high yield. Those other players would use it for trading. And the profit Celsius made from the yield would be used to pay back investors who deposited crypto.But when the downturn hit, this business model was put to the test. Celsius continues to face liquidity issues and has had to pause withdrawals to effectively stop the crypto version of a bank run.""Players seeking high yields exchanged fiat for crypto used the lending platforms as custodians, and then those platforms used the funds they raised to make highly risky investments – how else could they pay such high interest rates?,"" said Alexander. One problem that has become apparent lately is how much crypto companies relied on loans to one another.Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, is a Singapore crypto-focused hedge fund that has been one of the biggest victims of the market downturn. 3AC had exposure to luna and suffered losses after the collapse of UST (as mentioned above). The Financial Times reported last month that 3AC failed to meet a margin call from crypto lender BlockFi and had its positions liquidated.Then the hedge fund defaulted on a more than $660 million loan from Voyager Digital.As a result, 3AC plunged into liquidation and filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Three Arrows Capital is known for its highly-leveraged and bullish bets on crypto which came undone during the market crash, highlighting how such business models came under the pump.Contagion continued further.When Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy, the firm disclosed that, not only did it owe crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research $75 million — Alameda also owed Voyager $377 million.To further complicate matters, Alameda owns a 9% stake in Voyager.""Overall, June and Q2 as a whole were very difficult for crypto markets, where we saw the meltdown of some of the largest companies in large part due to extremely poor risk management and contagion from the collapse of 3AC, the largest crypto hedge fund,"" Kaiko's Medalie said.""It is now apparent that nearly every large centralized lender failed to properly manage risk, which subjected them to a contagion-style event with the collapse of a single entity. 3AC had taken out loans from nearly every lender that they were unable to repay following the wider market collapse, causing a liquidity crisis amid high redemptions from clients."" It's not clear when the market turbulence will finally settle. However, analysts expect there to be some more pain ahead as crypto firms struggle to pay down their debts and process client withdrawals.The next dominoes to fall could be crypto exchanges and miners, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.""We feel that this pain will spill over to the crowded exchange industry,"" said Butterfill. ""Given it is such a crowded market, and that exchanges rely to some extent on economies of scale the current environment is likely to highlight further casualties.""Even established players like Coinbase have been impacted by declining markets. Last month, Coinbase laid off 18% of its employees to cut down on costs. The U.S. crypto exchange has seen trading volumes collapse lately in tandem with falling digital currency prices.Meanwhile, crypto miners that rely on specialized computing equipment to settle transactions on the blockchain could also be in trouble, Butterfill said.""We have also seen examples of potential stress where miners have allegedly not paid their electricity bills, potentially alluding to cash flow issues,"" he said in a research note last week.""This is likely why we are seeing some miners sell their holdings.""The role played by miners comes at a heavy price — not just for the gear itself, but for a continuous flow of electricity needed to keep their machines running around the clock."
2022-07-14,"Lightyear, a stock trading app based in the U.K., has raised $25 million in fresh funding to expand its presence across Europe.The investment round was led by Silicon Valley’s Lightspeed, with additional backing from British billionaire Richard Branson.The company will launch its app in 19 more European countries Thursday, including Germany, France and Italy. Lightyear, a European challenger to trading platform Robinhood, has raised $25 million of funding in an investment round backed by British billionaire Richard Branson.Silicon Valley's Lightspeed Venture Partners led the deal, the company told CNBC exclusively — a rare vote of confidence for an upstart brokerage at a time when global stock markets are deep in the red.Founded in London last year by Estonian entrepreneurs Martin Sokk and Mihkel Aamer, Lightyear offers commission-free trading in over 3,000 global stocks and multi-currency accounts. Sokk and Aamer previously worked at Wise, the U.K.-listed money transfer firm.""For too long, financial markets have been overly complex with high barriers to entry and confusing jargon,"" Branson said in a statement shared with CNBC.""Martin, Mihkel and the Lightyear team are lifting the lid on the world of investing – making it more transparent whilst empowering people through education – to choose the products which are right for them.""The air and space travel tycoon took an undisclosed stake in Lightyear through his conglomerate Virgin Group. It's still a young start-up, having only launched in the U.K. in September. But Lightyear has ambitious expansion plans. The firm will launch its app in an additional 19 European countries including Germany and France Thursday, expanding its footprint to the euro zone. It's aiming to launch in non-euro countries like Sweden and Norway next.The deal shows how there's still ample investor appetite for an investment app focused on Europe, even as Robinhood faces a lull in trading volumes stateside, according to Nicole Quinn, general partner at Lightspeed.""Retail investing last year more than doubled in the U.S. Up to a fifth of all trades are retail investors in the U.S.,"" she told CNBC. ""We believe that Europe is heading in that direction.""Still, the cash injection comes at a difficult time for equity markets, which have tumbled in response to fears of a looming recession — Robinhood is down roughly 78% from its IPO price.Martin Sokk, Lightyear's CEO, said he's not worried about the declines in public markets.""The markets going up, down or sideways doesn't impact us too much because we're building something that takes an awfully long time,"" he said in an interview. Though Europe may be behind the U.S. when it comes to the prevalence of retail trading, the region has become increasingly crowded with various online trading apps on the hunt for clients.Lightyear faces competition from both established brokers like Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell and fintechs such as Revolut, Freetrade and eToro. Meanwhile, Robinhood has also signaled its intention to enter the European market, although with a focus on crypto rather than shares.The company previously tried to launch in the region some years ago, but scrapped the plans to focus on its home market instead. It has since agreed to acquire U.K.-based crypto exchange Ziglu.In May, Lightyear tapped Wander Rutgers, who previously led Robinhood's U.K. expansion efforts, as its chief operating officer.Investors have soured on high-growth tech companies like Robinhood lately over concern that their loss-making business models may not endure a deteriorating economic climate marked by rising inflation and tighter monetary policy.Lightyear isn't yet profitable. Right now, its main source of income is a flat 0.35% on currency conversions for trading in foreign shares.Sokk says the firm plans to eventually diversify its revenue stream with additional features, including a paid subscription service that's set to launch later this year."
2022-07-14,"Here are the most important news items that investors need to start their trading day: Just days ago, investors toasted a winning week in the markets as stocks attempted to crawl out of a big hole left by the worst first half for equities in five decades. Things have fallen off this week, however, as June inflation numbers came in hotter than expected, prompting concerns on Wall Street that the Fed would raise rates in an even more aggressive way this month. Futures were down across the board before the bell Thursday morning, while markets digested the first big bank earnings reports. Speaking of inflation, which remains at four-decade highs, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen couldn't escape the topic, even on a trip to Indonesia. She said tackling rising prices is the ""top priority"" in Washington, and pledged to support the Fed's efforts. The U.S. central bank is expected to boost rates by another 75 basis points this month, but some observers believe the policymakers could go even higher, to a 1%, or 100 basis point, hike. Yellen also weighed in on the impact of a stronger dollar on other economies: ""On the one hand, it can strengthen their ability to export, which is good for their growth. On the other hand, to the extent that countries have dollar-denominated debt, it can make those debt problems — which already are very severe — more difficult."" JPMorgan Chase kicked off big bank earnings by reporting a 28% decline in profit during the second quarter as the bank built up reserves to contend with bad loans. Later, Morgan Stanley reported that its revenue fell in the second quarter, which CEO James Gorman called ""a more volatile market environment than we have seen for some time."" Investors are looking for how Wall Street dealt with the volatility during the most recent period, which saw strong consumer spending and job growth, even as inflation kept mounting and growing signs of an economic slowdown. Netflix is pushing forward with its plan for an ad-supported tier – and it's doing so with a surprising partner. After talking with other prospective partners, including YouTube parent Google and NBCUniversal parent Comcast, the streaming giant decided on Microsoft. The ad-tier effort is still in the ""very early days,"" with ""much to work through,"" according to Netflix, but investors are eager for any signs that the company is working to counter a subscriber exodus. Netflix said earlier this year that it expects to lose 2 million subscribers during the second quarter. The company is slated to report quarterly results Tuesday. Lender Celsius is the latest crypto firm to fall, kicking off the bankruptcy process this week. A month ago, it froze customer accounts over ""extreme market conditions"" as various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, were in the midst of a dramatic sell-off. Celsius' move follows Voyager's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing last week after its exposure to Three Arrows Capital generated big losses.

2022-07-15,"Industry players told CNBC an improving macroeconomic picture, particular trading patterns and further shakeout or ""deleveraging"" could help bitcoin and the crypto market find a bottom.This could mean further downside for bitcoin to as low as $13,000 that will remove the ""last remaining weak hands.""There have been high-profile collapses in the latest ""crypto winter"" including lender Celsius and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  An improvement in macroeconomic factors, a particular trading pattern and a further shakeout of companies and projects could be the key ingredients required for bitcoin and the broader crypto market to bottom, industry players told CNBC.Bitcoin has plummeted more than 70% from its record high in November with around $2 trillion wiped off the value of the entire cryptocurrency market.For the last few weeks, bitcoin has been trading within a tight range between $19,000 and $22,000 with no major catalyst to the upside and traders trying to figure out where the bottom is.Here are some of the factors that could help the crypto market find a floor. Bitcoin has been hurt by the macroeconomic situation of soaring inflation that has forced the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks into hiking interest rates which has hurt risk assets such as stocks.Cryptocurrencies have seen some correlation with U.S. stock markets and have fallen in tandem with stocks.There are also fears of a recession but an improving macroeconomic picture could help the crypto market find the bottom. ""I think if inflation is under control, the economy is under control, there is no really severe recession"" then the market will stabilize, CK Zheng, co-founder of a cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund ZX Squared, told CNBC in an interview.U.S. inflation data for June came in hotter-than-expected on Wednesday, deepening fears that the Fed will get more aggressive in its fight to tame rising prices. However, there are some signs it could be peaking.If there are clues that the economy and inflation are ""getting under control,"" that could help the crypto market find a bottom, according to Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno.""If we see signs of this this month or even over the next few months, it would give more confidence to the market that a bottom is in across all risk assets including equities and crypto,"" Ayyar said. Meanwhile, a ""softer"" Fed and the peaking of U.S. dollar strength, could help the market find a bottom, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. Butterfill said a weaker economic outlook could push the Fed to slow down its tightening push.""A turn around in Fed policy and the consequent peaking of the DXY [dollar index] would also help define a true floor, we believe this is likely to happen at the Jackson Hole meeting at the end of the summer,"" Butterfill said, referring to an annual meeting of central bankers. One of the key features of the latest boom and bust cycle in crypto has been the amount of leverage in the system and the contagion that has caused.Firstly, there have been lending platforms that have promised retail investors high yields for depositing their crypto. One of those companies is Celsius, which last month was forced to pause withdrawals as it faces a liquidity issue. That's because Celsius lends out this crypto from its depositors to others willing to pay a high yield and then pockets the profit. That profit is then supposed to pay for the yield Celsius offers to its retail customers. But as prices crashed, that business model was put to the test.Another company that highlights the issue with excess leverage is crypto-focused hedge fund Three Arrows Capital or 3AC, which was known for its bullish bets on the industry. 3AC has an extensive list of counterparties that it is connected to and has borrowed money from. One of those is Voyager Digital, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after 3AC defaulted on roughly $670 million from the company.A number of other companies including BlockFi and Genesis also reportedly had exposure to 3AC.Three Arrows Capital has itself plunged into liquidation.""The deleveraging process we don't know if it is complete or not. I think it is still in the process of washing out the weak players,"" Zheng said, adding that when there are no more surprises with companies collapsing, that could help the market find a bottom.CoinShares's Butterfill said so-called miners, which use specialized high-power computers to validate transactions on crypto networks, could be the next victims of the washout. With crypto prices under pressure, there will be many mining operations that are unprofitable. Butterfill notes there have been some mining start-ups that raised funding last and ordered equipment that has either not been delivered or turned on.""A collapse in one of these mining startups or the associate lender is likely and would help define a trough to the crypto market,"" Butterfill told CNBC. Luno's Ayyar explained some of the trading patterns that might help define a bottom for the market. He said there could be a ""capitulation candle,"" where the price of bitcoin drops even further and ""wipes out the last remaining weak hands,"" before ""moving back up strongly.""If this happens, that indicates ""liquidity has been captured at lower levels and the market is now ready to go back up,"" Ayyar said.He noted that this happened in March 2020 when bitcoin fell more than 30% in a day before steadily climbing over the subsequent weeks.A second pattern could be an ""accumulation phase"" where bitcoin bottoms and spends a few months trading within a range before moving higher.In both cases, that could see bitcoin drop further to between $13,000 to $14,000, which would be a roughly 30% drop from the cryptocurrency's price on Wednesday.Zheng of ZX Squared said that bitcoin at between $13,000 and $15,000 is a possibility. But if institutional investors step in then that could help to support prices."

2022-07-15,"The bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law in 2021 is funneling unprecedented funds to the states for roads, bridges, broadband and more.Infrastructure is a major factor in competitiveness as the nation seeks to rebuild and revitalize the domestic supply chain.Some states are not waiting for the federal funds. They are leading the way in infrastructure improvements. The $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law by President Joe Biden late last year is a game changer, including more than $500 billion in new spending for longstanding needs including roads, bridges, electrical grid improvements, along with money for newer needs like broadband service and electric vehicle charging stations.According to the White House, much of that money will go directly to the states, with the biggest states — California, Texas, and New York — in line to receive more than $45 billion in direct aid.The funds are also critical in the nationwide push to rebuild the domestic supply chain. States that are fighting to lead that effort and are courting companies are touting their infrastructure. It is a major factor in CNBC's annual America's Top States for Business rankings. Under our methodology, we measure roads, bridges, ports and airports, as well as water and electric utilities, sites available for development, and sustainability.Some states are badly lagging in this effort. For them, the federal funds can't come soon enough.But these states are leading the way. In the heart of the Heartland, Missouri is a vital transportation link.

2022-07-17,"Celsius is down to $167 million ""in cash on hand,"" which they say will provide ""ample liquidity"" to support operations during the restructuring process. Celsius owes its users around $4.7 billion, according to its bankruptcy filing — and there's an approximate $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet. Celsius filing for bankruptcy this week surprised virtually no one. Once a platform freezes customer assets, it's typically all over. But even though it was expected, it remains a really big deal for the industry.In October 2021, CEO Alex Mashinsky said the crypto lender had $25 billion in assets under management. Even as recently as May — despite crashing cryptocurrency prices — the lender was managing about $11.8 billion in assets, according to its website. The firm had another $8 billion in client loans, making it one of the world's biggest names in crypto lending.Now, Celsius is down to $167 million ""in cash on hand,"" which it says will provide ""ample liquidity"" to support operations during the restructuring process.Meanwhile, Celsius owes its users around $4.7 billion, according to its bankruptcy filing — and there's an approximate $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet.It goes to show that leverage is one hell of a drug, but the moment you suck out all that liquidity, it's a whole lot harder to keep the party going.The fall of Celsius marks the third major bankruptcy in the crypto ecosystem in two weeks, and it is being billed as crypto's Lehman Brothers moment — comparing the contagion effect of a failed crypto lender to the fall of a major Wall Street bank that ultimately foretold the 2008 mortgage debt and financial crisis.Regardless of whether the Celsius implosion portends a larger collapse of the greater crypto ecosystem, the days of customers collecting double-digit annual returns are over. For Celsius, promising those big yields as a means to onboard new users is a big part of what led to its ultimate downfall.""They were subsidizing it and taking losses to get clients in the door,"" said Castle Island Venture's Nic Carter. ""The yields on the other end were fake and subsidized. Basically, they were pulling through returns from [Ponzi schemes]."" Three weeks after Celsius halted all withdrawals due to ""extreme market conditions"" — and a few days before the crypto lender ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection — the platform was still advertising in big bold text on its website annual returns of nearly 19%, which paid out weekly.""Transfer your crypto to Celsius and you could be earning up to 18.63% APY in minutes,"" read the website on July 3.Promises such as these helped to rapidly lure in new users. Celsius said it had 1.7 million customers, as of June.The company's bankruptcy filing shows that Celsius also has more than 100,000 creditors, some of whom lent the platform cash without any collateral to back up the arrangement. The list of its top 50 unsecured creditors, includes Sam Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research, as well as an investment firm based in the Cayman Islands.Those creditors are likely first in line to get their money back, should there be anything for the taking — with mom and pop investors left holding the bag.After filing its bankruptcy petition, Celsius clarified that ""most account activity will be paused until further notice"" and that it was ""not requesting authority to allow customer withdrawals at this time.""The FAQ goes on to say that reward accruals are also halted through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, and customers will not be receiving reward distributions at this time.That means customers trying to access their crypto cash are out of luck for now. It is also unclear whether bankruptcy proceedings will ultimately enable customers to ever recoup their losses. If there is some sort of payout at the end of what could be a multi-year process, there is also the question of who would be first in line to get it.Unlike the traditional banking system, which typically insures customer deposits, there aren't formal consumer protections in place to safeguard user funds when things go wrong. Celsius spells out in its terms and conditions that any digital asset transferred to the platform constitutes a loan from the user to Celsius. Because there was no collateral put up by Celsius, customer funds were essentially just unsecured loans to the platform.Also in the fine print of Celsius' terms and conditions is a warning that in the event of bankruptcy, ""any Eligible Digital Assets used in the Earn Service or as collateral under the Borrow Service may not be recoverable"" and that customers ""may not have any legal remedies or rights in connection with Celsius' obligations."" The disclosure reads like an attempt at blanket immunity from legal wrongdoing, should things ever go south.Another popular lending platform catering to retail investors with high-yield offerings is Voyager Digital, which has 3.5 million customers and recently filed for bankruptcy, as well.To reassure their millions of users, Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich tweeted that after the company goes through bankruptcy proceedings, users with crypto in their account would potentially be eligible for a sort of grab bag of stuff, including a combination of the crypto in their account, common shares in the reorganized Voyager, Voyager tokens, and then whatever proceeds they are able to get from the company's now-defunct loan to the once prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.It is unclear what the Voyager token would actually be worth, or whether any of this will come together in the end.Three Arrows Capital is the third major crypto player seeking bankruptcy protection in a U.S. federal courtroom, in a trend that can't help beg the question: Will bankruptcy court ultimately be the place where new precedent in the crypto sector is set, in a sort of regulate-by-ruling model?Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are already looking to establish more ground rules.Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., are aiming to provide clarity with a bill that lays out a comprehensive framework for regulating the crypto industry and divvies up oversight among regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Celsius' overarching problem is that the nearly 20% APY it was offering to customers wasn't real.In one lawsuit, Celsius is being accused of operating a Ponzi scheme, in which it paid early depositors with the money it got from new users.Celsius also invested its funds in other platforms offering similarly sky-high returns, in order to keep its business model afloat.A report from The Block found that Celsius had at least half a billion dollars invested in Anchor, which was the flagship lending platform of the now failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project terraUSD (UST). Anchor promised investors a 20% annual percentage yield on their UST holdings — a rate many analysts said was unsustainable.Celsius was one of multiple platforms to park its cash with Anchor, which is a big part of why the cascade of major failures was so significant and swift after the UST project imploded in May.""They always have to source yield, so they move the assets around into risky instruments that are impossible to hedge,"" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer and adjunct professor of finance at the University of Southern California.As for the $1.2 billion gap in its balance sheet, Bhatia chalks it up to poor risk models and the fact that collateral was sold out from under it by institutional lenders.""They probably lost customer deposits in UST,"" Bhatia added. ""When the assets go down in price, that's how you get a 'hole.' The liability remains, so again, poor risk models.""Celsius isn't alone. Cracks keep forming in the lending corner of the crypto market. Castle Island Venture's Carter says the net effect of all this is that credit is being destroyed and withdrawn, underwriting standards are being tightened, and solvency is being tested, so everyone is withdrawing liquidity from crypto lenders.""This has the effect of driving up yields, as credit gets more scarce,"" said Carter, who noted that we're already seeing this happen.Carter expects to see a general inflationary deleveraging in the U.S. and elsewhere, which he says only further makes the case for stablecoins, as relatively hard money, and bitcoin, as truly hard money.""But the portion of the industry that relies on the issuance of frivolous tokens will be forced to change,"" he said. ""So I expect the result to be heterogeneous across the crypto space, depending on the specific sector."""
2022-07-17,"NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a controversial piece of the crypto conversation, evoking both passionate criticism and praise as Web3 becomes a bigger part of popular culture.Keith Grossman, president of Time, has spent the past year building the 99-year-old media brand's NFT business, TIMEPieces, and the publisher now accepts 33 cryptocurrencies for digital subscriptions.Since September, the media giant has created, or ""dropped"" as it's known in the space, more than 20,000 TIMEPieces NFTs, generating a $10 million profit and $600,000 for charities. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have become, perhaps, the most controversial piece of the crypto conversation, evoking both passionate criticism and praise as Web3 becomes a bigger part of popular culture.Able to shut out the noise on both sides of the argument is an unlikely figure: Keith Grossman, president of Time, who has spent the past year building the 99 year-old media brand's NFT business, TIMEPieces, from the ground up.NFTs are unique digital assets, like artwork and sports trading cards, that are verified and stored using blockchain technology, but critics see them as overhyped and potentially harmful to the environment given the energy-intensive nature of cryptocurrencies. Many NFTs are built on the network behind ethereum, the second-biggest token.The rise of the internet meant that anyone could view images, videos and songs online for free. People are buying NFTs out of the belief that they'll be able to prove ownership of a virtual item thanks to blockchain technology.""All it is is a token that allows you to verify ownership on the blockchain. Its secondary value is allowing the owner to control their personal information,"" Grossman told CNBC in a recent interview. TIMEPieces token holders can connect their digital wallets to TIME's website, which gives them unlimited access to TIME content, as well as exclusive invitations to both virtual and in-person events. Some of the more popular tokens within the TIMEPieces collection include photography and other forms of digital art from 89 emerging Web3 artists, including Farokh Sarmad, Joanne Hollings and Julie Pacino, daughter of actor Al Pacino, among others. It's also attracted many well-known celebrity collectors, from Anthony Hopkins to Eva Longoria and Miguel.In addition to auctioning off original renderings of their most famous cover stories, TIME adds its iconic red-frame to each NFT created by these emerging artists — a group curated by the media giant's creative director, D.W. Pine. Grossman describes it as highlighting the ""next generation of artists,"" as the brand prepares to celebrate a century of publishing the news-related cover art it's known for today.Since September, TIME has created, or ""dropped"" as it's known in the space, more than 20,000 TIMEPieces NFTs that are owned by roughly 12,000 digital wallets, approximately half of which are connected to Time.com, according to Grossman — that's translated into $10 million in profit for TIME, as well as $600,000 generated for various charities.TIME recently partnered with ethereum-based gaming platform The Sandbox to create a virtual space in the metaverse dubbed TIME Square, which will serve as a central location for the brand to host virtual art and commerce events.With its $1.5 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko, The Sandbox is among the largest metaverse projects, due in large part to its early adoption of blockchain technology. In November, a virtual plot in The Sandbox set the record for the highest-valued digital land sale when metaverse developer Republic Realm paid $4.3 million to purchase a digital parcel from Atari.Investors have been quick to assert that long-term value in digital assets will come from their utility. It's a message that's been difficult for institutional investors to digest as collectible artwork, such as the prominent Bored Ape Yacht Club, which took center stage in the early days of NFTs, and equally-hyped Crypto Punks, recently saw prices fall precipitously.""As this new technology was getting adapted, one camp emerged around the notion of building a community that had a set of values and principles,"" Grossman said. ""And another emerged around what I would call 'greed-based communities.'"" Vitalik Buterin, who co-created ethereum in 2013, recently said in an interview with TIME that he is worried about trends he has observed in the space, telling the publication that ""crypto itself has a lot of dystopian potential if implemented wrong.""""The peril is you have these $3 million monkeys and it becomes a different kind of gambling,"" Buterin said.Speaking at a recent TechCrunch talk, Bill Gates described the crypto and NFT phenomenon as something that's ""100% based on greater fool theory,"" referring to the idea that overvalued assets will go up in price when there are enough investors willing to pay more for them. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder joked that ""expensive digital images of monkeys"" would ""improve the world immensely.""The crypto industry has experienced steep cuts in valuation for currencies and metaverse projects since reaching all-time highs in November 2021, according to CoinGecko. Cryptocurrencies have seen $2 trillion in value erased. It estimates the metaverse sector to currently be worth over $6 billion.Adding to broader crypto concerns, Celsius, a crypto lending platform that promised high yields to users who deposited their cryptocurrency, recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Meanwhile, OpenSea — the world's largest NFT marketplace and home for TIMEPieces token listings — announced on Thursday that it's cutting its workforce by 20%. ""Forget Bored Apes for a second,"" Grossman told CNBC. ""When you move out of the collectible space and focus on the community [of creators and artists] ...the tokens not only allow you to verify ownership, but it allows them to affix a royalty on future sales.""""What you're seeing right now, as the markets are sort of unstable and correcting themselves, is that the greed-based communities without liquidity in the system, are not really performing with the expectations of the members in those communities,"" Grossman said. The past decade of technology saw the value created in the world of Web2 accrue to tech giants instead of creators, said Avery Akkineni, president of NFT consulting firm Vayner3. Blockchain allows there to be a more decentralized method of payments, incentives and rewards, which she said, ""I think we'll see play into media.""""For enterprises, there's never been a better time to launch a product that's free, or very low cost, that allows your community to participate without a very high barrier to entry price point,"" Akkineni said in a May interview from Gary Vaynerchuk's VeeCon in Minneapolis. Mathew Sweezey, director of market strategy at Salesforce — Salesforce co-founder and co-CEO Marc Benioff owns Time — said in a blog post that 2022 would be the year ""pioneering brands will search for utility via NFTs,"" and he referred to Time's project as a ""great example.""Big brands from every industry, including Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Nike, Gucci and the National Football League, have brought NFTs into their marketing initiatives.Many analysts say TIME's move into the metaverse heralds good opportunities ahead. ""The more mainstream brands we can get transitioning into Web3, the quicker we can reach mass adoption,"" Kieran Warwick, co-founder of metaverse game Illuvium, told The Defiant. ""Partnering with The Sandbox is massive news for anyone in the space."" ""Media companies, for years, have looked at consumers and said 'you're a renter on my platform and I'll give you access to portraying your identity on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or the like, and in return, I'm going to extract your data,'"" Grossman said. ""What an NFT actually does behind the scenes is it allows consumers to own an asset, so you move from being an online renter to an online owner ... and not actually say who they are from a personally identifiable aspect.""It's not just Time within the legacy media industry. The Associated Press and the New York Times have also launched their own NFT collections in the past year. But Grossman's strategy is underpinned by the thesis that online identity is just as important as physical identity.""In September 2020, I started getting really fascinated with the crypto space from a personal perspective, because I kept hearing everyone say there's going to be no inflation, and yet, everyone was just pumping money into the system to try and stave off Covid,"" Grossman said. ""That equation didn't make sense to me.""Covid played a big role in the NFT boom. Last year, the total value of NFT transactions reached $17.6 billion, according to a study from NonFungible and BNP Paribas-affiliated research firm L'Atelier, up from $250 million the previous year and fueled by a boom in many asset markets during the pandemic as stay-at-home restrictions resulted in people spending a lot more of their time on the internet and building more cash savings. In February 2021, a crypto art rendition of the Nyan Cat meme from 2011 sold for about $590,000 in an online auction. Grossman said it caught the attention of Benioff, who appointed Grossman as the publication's first president since acquiring it from Meredith Corp. for $190 million in 2018.""And that's when everything clicked,"" Grossman said, adding that, for Time, it was a natural extension of the brand's red-frame cover stories. ""I said that within 30 days, we would start accepting cryptocurrency for digital payments. Today we accept 33 cryptocurrencies for digital subscriptions. ... And then I said within six months, we will figure out how to use a token and a blockchain to change the relationship of a consumer with our brand,"" Grossman added. ""To be honest, I had no clue how we were going to do that. I just knew it was possible.""The demographics of Time platforms are varied. According to Grossman, the average reader of TIME magazine is a 50-year-old male; the reader of Time.com is a 40-year-old female; 62% of the engagers on TIME's social feeds are under the age of 35, and one-third outside the U.S.In the case of NFTs, ""it's small; it's like a psychographic of people who weren't thinking about Time before, but all of a sudden like the brand,"" Grossman said.The average price point for a digital subscription to Time.com is about $24, but the average TIMEPieces NFT is about $1,000.""At the end of the day, we're able to have just as strong a relationship with the consumer, if not stronger, through community building, than when we sell a $24 subscription,"" he said. ""Outside of the [Time] name and outside of a tiny logo in the corner, the hero is always the creator. They have a huge following and are uplifted by their community ... TIMEPieces comes in and says 'we want you to be a part of this,' we're validating the creator and their community ... with the heft of our nearly 100 years of legacy and trust."" While prominent investors continue to be believers in the long-term potential of digital assets, there are plenty of skeptics.""I think there's a lot of hesitancy in terms of not understanding why this wave of digital asset ownership matters,"" Akkineni said. ""It's incredible how many [CEOs] are actually taking the time to spend learning, both from a business building perspective and a community building perspective, as well as a consumer engagement perspective.""The surge in NFTs is still fairly new, but massive amounts of money have already exchanged hands among collectors. Since 2017, for example, NFT collectibles have generated over $6.2 billion in sales while digital art has generated over $1.9 billion, according to NonFungible, which tracks historical sales data of NFTs.Ultimately, moving the technology beyond the NFT is the goal, according to Grossman, who is most bullish on the underlying concept.""It wasn't until Steve Jobs held up the iPod and said we'd have '1,000 songs in our pocket,' that people stopped thinking about the technology and started thinking about what the experience is,"" Grossman said. ""In my opinion, for mass adoption, the technology has to become invisible. In this early stage [of NFTs], the technology is leading the conversation and the word NFT should disappear from the lexicon. It should literally go into the background and all the token should be doing is providing the online verification behind the experience.""""For that to happen, you need a lot of friction to come out of the system,"" he added. Correction: The total value of NFT transactions reached $17.6 billion in 2021, according to a study from NonFungible and BNP Paribas-affiliated research firm L'Atelier. An earlier version of this article misstated that figure. "
2022-07-17,"Rising mortgage rates, a reflection of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to curb inflation, are roiling the U.S. housing market.Many forecasters now believe the market could cool considerably following years of explosive growth. Some states will fare better than others.Because companies seek locations where the housing situation will be attractive to employees, CNBC’s America’s Top States for Business study considers the health of each state’s housing market. The three most important things in real estate: location, location, location. And the U.S. real estate market is in a weird place right now.Mortgage rates are nearly double what they were a year ago, reflecting the Federal Reserve's campaign to rein in inflation. But they have also been volatile, including some sharp declines from week to week.Home prices remain stuck at historic highs with bidding wars reported in some places, even as the inventory of homes for sale begins to grow and housing markets across the country, including some of the biggest in the states below, begin to cool.Where is everything heading? Realtor.com recently revised its 2022 forecast, now calling for sales to decline by 6.7% this year. Forecasters previously called for a 6.6% increase. But even if the new forecast holds true, it would still be the second biggest sales year since 2007, only trailing last year.As always, some states will fare better than others. Because companies consider the local housing market in their location decisions, CNBC's America's Top States for Business study gauges the health of each state's housing market as part of the broader Economy category, which is worth 13% of a state's overall score under this year's methodology. The housing metric considers year-over-year price appreciation, new construction per year, as well as foreclosures and insolvency in the first quarter. Looking for a safe place to ride out a potential housing storm?

U.S. stock futures were also higher. Cryptocurrencies, in particularly bitcoin, has been closely correlated with equity market trade. Often, a rise in stocks will also lift sentiment in the crypto market. But investors are also watching whether the carnage over the last few weeks, which has seen bitcoin near 70% off its all-time high that was hit in November and billions of dollars wiped off the market, might be over.The price crash has brought the downfall of several high-profile companies in the space, most notably hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto lender Celsius, both of which have filed for bankruptcy.These collapses have caused contagion across the industry and seen other associated companies come under pressure.Much of this has been caused by the huge amounts of leverage and borrowing that has taken place in this latest crypto cycle. Three Arrows Capital for example took out loans it was unable to pay back once the crypto collapse took place. Celsius, which offered customers yields over 18% for depositing their digital coins, took on high risk trading activities to earn the interest to try to give back to its users.Crypto companies have been selling off whatever assets they have to try to meet their liabilities which has put pressure on the broader market.Analysts say there are signs this contagion could be slowing.""The worst of market contagion has likely run its course, with the majority of forced selling behind us,"" David Moreno, research analyst at CryptoCompare, wrote in a research note.Despite the rally, the crypto market is still suffering. Both bitcoin and ether are down more than 50% this year. Bitcoin had its worst quarter in more than a decade in the second quarter.Analysts are still not convinced of any significant move higher in the near term.""Given the severely negative performance in Q2, it is unsurprising that a 'relief' bounce has occurred.

2022-07-18,"The value of cryptocurrencies have been incredibly volatile, but the blockchain technology behind them is almost certainly here to stay.Many states are jockeying to lead the way as this emerging industry develops.CNBC’s 2022 America’s Top States for Business study is paying special attention to factors crucial to cryptocurrency, including regulations, mining capacity, and power costs. Investing in cryptocurrencies is clearly not for the faint of heart. The value of bitcoin has plunged from its high last fall, and others have followed similarly gut-wrenching paths.But that does not mean that the revolutionary technology behind them, which allows for innovations such as smart contracts and instant peer-to-peer payments, is not here to stay. Because of that, many states are jockeying for leadership in this emerging industry.With that in mind, CNBC's America's Top States for Business study — which scores all 50 states on a broad range of competitive features — is paying special attention to cryptocurrency under this year's methodology.Our crucial Cost of Doing Business category has always included the cost of electricity, a key consideration in this power-hungry industry. This year, our Technology and Innovation category includes a measure of each state's share of computational power or ""hash rate."" And our Business Friendliness category gives special consideration to how states are regulating this increasingly important industry.Based on those metrics, these ten states are leading the way. ""It's happening,"" Republican Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted last year. ""Texas will be the crypto leader."" He may be right. The Lone Star State is consistently at or near the top for mining capacity, running neck and neck with Georgia. Electricity is affordable even before the special deals available for crypto miners, though the state's independent power grid has had reliability issues. Texas has begun regulating cryptocurrencies with an eye towards giving them a solid foundation for growth.Mining capacity: No. 2Electricity cost: No. 16Regulation: No. 21 (tie) Mining runs deep in Kentucky's heritage, but these days the state is trading coal for crypto. Last year, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed into law a series of tax breaks for cryptocurrency mining, including extending electricity incentives that had been designated for renewable energy use to include the growing industry. The tax breaks are already working to attract miners. The state also began updating its financial regulations to encompass crypto.Mining capacity: No. 3Electricity cost: No. 13Regulation: No. 21 (tie) Virginia's Bureau of Financial Institutions has taken a mostly hands-off approach toward regulating cryptocurrency while keeping residents of the commonwealth informed about the risks. In April, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a groundbreaking bill clearing the way for banks to hold customers' crypto assets, provided they have the proper risk management tools in place.Mining capacity: No. 15Electricity cost: No. 15Regulation: No. 6 The Gem State offers the lowest electricity costs in the nation, though that has yet to translate to a big influx of mining activity. This year, the state passed the Digital Assets Act, creating a broad framework for cryptocurrency regulation. The new law specifically excludes virtual currencies from regulation under state securities laws.Mining capacity: No. 29Electricity cost: No. 1Regulation: No. 6 Low electricity costs are also a plus in the Evergreen State. Combine that with a strong tech ecosystem, and it is proving to be a draw for miners. This year, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee signed a new law establishing the Washington State Blockchain Work Group aimed at advancing the new technology and establishing partnerships between the state and the industry.Mining capacity: No. 8Electricity cost: No. 6Regulation: No. 21 (tie) The Beehive State is carefully crafting regulations for blockchain, and in March, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill that allows state and local governments to accept payments in the form of digital assets. The state also formed a new blockchain innovation task force.Mining capacity: No. 23Electricity cost: No. 3Regulation: No. 1 (tie) Low costs and smart regulation are making The Peace Garden State fertile ground for crypto, and the effort may be paying off. Last month, mining company Bitzero announced it will build its North American headquarters in North Dakota. The company, whose investors include Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary, is aiming to build an environmentally friendly bitcoin mining operation.Mining capacity: No. 18Electricity cost: No. 4Regulation: No. 4 German high-performance computing company Northern Data, which leverages its crypto mining capabilities to create data centers around the world, has chosen Pryor, Oklahoma, east of Tulsa, for its North American headquarters.

Wyoming has enacted dozens of laws to attract the industry, including a framework to charter crypto banks. The state also offers some of the lowest electricity costs in the nation.

2022-07-18,"New data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows that miners are rapidly exiting their bitcoin positions.14,000 bitcoin, or more than $300 million at its current price, was transferred out of wallets belonging to miners in a single day — and in the last few weeks, miners have offloaded the largest amount of bitcoin since Jan. 2021. New data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows that miners are rapidly exiting their bitcoin positions.14,000 bitcoin, worth more than $300 million at its current price, was transferred out of wallets belonging to miners in a single 24-hour period at the end of last week — and in the last few weeks, miners have offloaded the largest amount of bitcoin since Jan. 2021. The phenomenon is called ""miner capitulation,"" and it typically indicates that miners are preparing to sell their previously mined coins in order to cover ongoing mining expenses.Bitcoin is currently trading around $21,600, up about 3% in the last 24 hours. Still, the wider crypto market has been in a slump for months, with bitcoin down nearly 70% from its all-time high of around $69,000 in Nov. 2021.Meanwhile, inflation is on a tear, and the cost of energy is hitting record highs as the war between Russia and Ukraine rages on.Lower bitcoin prices and higher energy costs are compressing profit margins for miners, which is part of why some are selling bitcoin at current prices to try to contain exposure to continued volatility in the sector and mitigate against further risk to their bottom line.""Given rising electricity costs, and bitcoin's steep price decline, the cost of mining a bitcoin may be higher than its price for some miners,"" Citi analyst Joseph Ayoub wrote in a note on July 5.""With high-profile reports of resignations from mining companies, as well as miners that have used their equipment as collateral to borrow money, the bitcoin mining industry could be under growing pressure,"" the note continued. Core Scientific, which is one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining companies in the U.S., sold nearly all its bitcoin in June. CEO Mike Levitt tells CNBC that just like any other business, bitcoin miners need to pay their bills.""We mine and earn or produce bitcoin, but our costs, expenses, and liabilities are in dollars,"" said Levitt.It's still profitable to mine bitcoin, Levitt says, with around 50% margins across the industry. That's down from 80% margins at its peak.Last month, Core sold 7,202 bitcoin at an average price of $23,000. Levitt tells CNBC they invested the proceeds of approximately $167 million primarily into growth-oriented activities, including new ASIC servers and additional data center capacity for their self-mining and colocation businesses.But they also deployed some of that capital to repay debt and to help settle five years of employee stock grants.Long-term, Levitt is optimistic because there's tremendous positive operating leverage in the business. Over certain levels, every dollar increase in the price of bitcoin is 100% operating income to bitcoin miners.""We would all be cheering loudly if bitcoin were to get back to $35,000, $40,000. There is no doubt about that,"" he said.But productivity per unit of electricity also matters, and when prices are low, large-scale miners like Core Scientific tend to face less competition from hobbyists and small operations.""As prices fall, the global hashrate — or the competition for the production of bitcoin — decreases, as less efficient miners come off the network,"" explained Levitt.The hashrate is a term used to describe the computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network, and it is down 15% in the last month. That is ultimately a good thing for the large-scale miners who can afford to weather the downturns.As less efficient miners come off the network and global hashrate declines, machines that continue to mine bitcoin get more productive.""And thus, the cost of energy, if you will, per bitcoin produced, goes down,"" said Levitt."
2022-07-19,"The EthCC conference in Paris is for hardcore ethereum developers and technologists to hack, code and talk shop.The event comes at a difficult time for the crypto industry. Major names like Three Arrows Capital and lenders like Celsius and Voyager Digital have all filed for bankruptcy, and the knock-on effect has been brutal.But the party goes on, including a secret rave 65 feet underground at the Catacombs, an ancient graveyard that holds the bones of 6 million Parisians. PARIS — About 65 feet below ground level in Paris is a labyrinth of centuries-old tunnels known as the Catacombs, which hold the skeletal remains of around six million Parisians. Legend has it that plague victims comprised some of the bones lining the hallways.This week, it turned into a techno cave with neon lights for top ethereum programmers to party till 4 A.M. The mantra was ""leave no trace"" so everything was gone by sunrise.""It's very illegal but also very crypto,"" explained one of the roughly 100 party attendees, who declined to be identified for fear of alerting the Paris police.She also said the trek was one of the most ridiculous things she's ever done in her life. The expedition included crawling under a fence, wiggling down caves, tracing the path of old train tracks, wading through thigh-deep, muddy water — and a bit of bouldering.""There was a gap in the rocks, and I didn't think anything of it. I was just like, 'Oh, we're pausing here,' and then a human popped out,"" the attendee explained. Multiple squads gathered across the 14th arrondissement of Paris late Saturday night to sneak into the underground landmark. Each team was assembled via an anonymous Telegram group and assigned its own entrance.""You got a link and a password to a survey form, and you basically answered some questions and gave your Telegram. If you were chosen for this adventure, you got added to a Telegram group with a handful of other people you didn't know, and the guide dropped into the thread on the day-of to tell you a meeting spot,"" recounted the attendee.Another partygoer turned on their fitness tracker to map the distance and found they had traveled four and a half miles underground.All the paths converged on a large central cave, where there was a DJ, a bar with neon lights, candles, and people dancing.The only downside to an underground rave hosted in a mass grave?""People start thinking, 'Er, where am I gonna get out?'"" said another person who attended.Welcome to the Ethereum Community Conference, an annual event that draws the world's top developers and cryptographers to the City of Light. The event officially kicked off Tuesday morning, but key players in the space descended on Paris days in advance to take part in ancillary events like the Metaverse Summit and a Parisian-style salon dubbed The Future of Content in Web3. And for the parties like La Degen and Raave. EthCC is in some ways the opposite of Bitcoin Miami, the highest profile crypto conference.While Bitcoin Miami boasts attendance in the tens of thousands, EthCC deliberately capped tickets at 2,000 to keep it small and intimate. CNBC spoke to nearly a dozen people on the ground in Paris who weren't able to buy a ticket before the event sold out, but came to town anyway just to participate in all the side events.""They kept it tailored and small intentionally, because they could easily have sold more tickets,"" said Samantha Yap, who's helping to coordinate EthCC.The event comes at a difficult time for the crypto industry. Major names like Three Arrows Capital and lenders like Celsius and Voyager Digital have all filed for bankruptcy, and the knock-on effect has been brutal, shaking overall confidence in the sector — and raising questions about the current state of the decentralized finance (or DeFi) ecosystem.""I think a lot of projects were completely without substance,"" developer Max Saal said of the many companies that cropped up in 2021 amid the boom in token prices. ""It's a deterrent for people who are...actually building something real.""Meanwhile, ethereum is also on the precipice of a years-in-the-making upgrade that will be its most significant overhaul since the digital currency was launched nearly a decade ago. There's a lot at stake with this roll-out.Cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and bitcoin are often criticized for the process of mining to generate new coins. Both currently use a so-called proof-of-work mining model, where miners race to solve complex math equations using banks of powerful computers.Ethereum has been working to shift from the energy-intensive proof-of-work method for securing the network to a proof-of-stake model, which requires users to leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens. This requires far less power and will translate to faster transactions.The transition has been repeatedly pushed back for the last several years because of major flaws in the implementations. But a series of dress rehearsals in the last few months have shown promising signs that all will go smoothly when the so-called ""merge"" happens in September.If things don't go well, there is a question of what impact that might have on digital assets more broadly. Take DeFi, which aims to recreate traditional financial systems like banks, but with cryptocurrency. They mostly run on the ethereum blockchain. It is unclear what would happen to large swaths of the DeFi ecosystem should there be any hiccups with the big transition to proof-of-stake later this year.But the vibe on the ground at EthCC is overwhelmingly positive, with most people excited that a bear market translates to no grifters because there's no fast, easy profit to be made.Dani Osorio, who has spent the last several years working in infrastructure and developer relations and organized the EthDenver conference eariler this year, tells CNBC that there are a lot of blockchain and crypto conferences around the world, but EthCC is the only one that's focused on the technical participants.""You'll see CTOs, technical founders, cryptographers, and protocol researchers. That's unheard of,"" said Osorio, who added that she met ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin in a courtyard in Paris back in 2018 at the first EthCC venue.Felice Schimmel represents TikTok celebrities, and she began to go down the rabbit hole of web3 in Nov. 2021. She came to Paris to better understand the conversations happening among insiders, especially as regulation becomes more of an international conversation.""[Web3] allows you to have an opportunity to own your fans and your followers. That allows you to connect with them without having a platform in the middle of that conversation.""Not even a Bohemian prince hailing from a 600-year-old noble family in the Czech Republic was able to grab a ticket in time before they sold out. But William Lobkowicz — who has spent the last year minting his family's collection of 20,000 cultural objects as NFTs — flew in from Prague anyway to talk shop with some of the brightest minds in the blockchain ecosystem.""I come from an industry that is struggling and where drastic change is needed for sustainable and long-lasting development,"" he told CNBC. ""What if conventional no longer works?""People don't talk price charts or markets at EthCC, but ether is currently rallying after a stretch of depressing pricing. Ether is the token native to the ethereum blockchain, and it is up almost 40% in the last five days, after a long plunge that took it down nearly 70% from its peak last November."
2022-07-19,"Crypto platforms Celsius and Voyager filed for bankruptcy protection after suspending account withdrawals.The debacle raises questions about what happens to investors' funds when an exchange ends up failing.Traders hoping to recoup some or all of their holdings anytime soon are likely to end up disappointed, according to legal experts. Traders hoping to recoup their funds from failed cryptocurrency exchanges anytime soon are likely to end up disappointed, legal experts tell CNBC.Crypto trading and lending firms Celsius and Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy this month, leaving users' assets trapped inside their platforms. Both firms froze client accounts after an influx of withdrawals led to liquidity issues.Celsius operated much like a bank, taking customer deposits and lending them out or making risky gambles on so-called decentralized finance products to generate high yields.Voyager had a similar model. The company got caught up in the collapse of high-profile crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which itself went belly up after defaulting on a $660 million loan from Voyager.Such interconnectedness has left the crypto market vulnerable to contagion, with major firms falling like dominoes as a plunge in token prices has unwound excessive leverage in the system. Cryptocurrencies aren't regulated, meaning they don't offer people the same protections they would get with money held in a bank or shares in a brokerage firm.For example, the U.S. Securities Investor Protection Corporation insures traders up to $500,000 in cash and securities if a member broker runs into financial difficulties.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, meanwhile, offers bank depositors protection of up to $250,000 if an insured lender fails.There are similar schemes in place in the U.K. and European Union.With no laws governing cryptoassets, there's no guarantee investors would be able to recoup their funds if an exchange were to freeze someone's account — or, worse yet, completely collapse. ""There isn't such a scheme like that at this point"" for crypto, said Daniel Besikof, partner at Loeb & Loeb. ""It wouldn't surprise me if one happens down the line,"" he added. ""This will ramp up calls for enhanced regulation."" For now, it's still not entirely clear. While there are examples of crypto firms filing for bankruptcy overseas — Mt. Gox in Japan, for example — such an event is unprecedented in the U.S.Creditors of Mt. Gox, which went offline in 2014, are still waiting to get repaid billions of dollars' worth of the cryptocurrency.The problem with centralized crypto platforms is they can mix different clients' funds together to make risky bets, according to Daniel Saval, a lawyer with Kobre & Kim. Such commingling may lead to a ruling that the assets are the property of the exchange, not users.""Users may be surprised to learn that, in a bankruptcy scenario, the crypto and funds held in their accounts may not be considered their own property,"" Saval says.""Exchanges will often pool different customers' crypto and funds together in the same storage wallet or account.""

Here's where analysts see it heading next.These tech stocks have never been more compelling, Goldman Sachs saysBank of America says this chip stock is the best way to play the electric vehicle transition What happens to customers' funds in bankruptcy cases will depend a lot on the company's user agreement and how it used their assets, Besikof said.Celsius' terms of use state that any funds deposited with the firm ""may not be recoverable"" in the event of bankruptcy. The firm filed for Chapter 11 protection last week, revealing a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet and owing users around $4.7 billion.Celsius claims to have $167 million in cash on hand. But it's still not letting customers withdraw their funds, and hasn't offered clarity on when it will reopen withdrawals.Voyager says its customers' dollars are kept in an FDIC-insured account at Metropolitan Commercial Bank in New York — however, this claim was contested by legal experts and the bank itself. The FDIC only offers protection of funds in the event of a bank's failure, not a crypto exchange.For its part, Voyager says it's working through a ""reconciliation and fraud prevention process"" with its banking partner, after which users will be able to regain access to their cash.Voyager also laid out a plan to reimburse users with crypto in their accounts, Voyager shares and the company's own token, as well as any debt recovered from Three Arrows Capital.Both Celsius and Voyager hired Kirkland & Ellis, the prestigious law firm, to represent them in court.""Investors holding crypto assets through Voyager Digital and now Celsius have been placed in a difficult position, with their accounts frozen, their lawsuits stayed and the value and timing of any recoveries unknown,"" Besikof said.""There is a lot of work for them to do in bankruptcy court before these issues will be resolved.""Celsius and Voyager filed for what's known as Chapter 11, a form of bankruptcy protection that allows firms to restructure their debts. The aim is to ensure there's still a viable business by the end of the process.There's a strong likelihood that Celsius and Voyager's users will be treated as ""unsecured creditors,"" legal experts said, a categorization that puts them in the same bucket as a business' suppliers and contractors. This means they would likely be at the back of a long queue of creditors lining up for a payout from the court proceedings — behind banks, employees and tax authorities.In a May regulatory filing, Coinbase said its users would be treated as ""general unsecured creditors"" in the event of bankruptcy.""In general, most customers in cryptocurrency exchanges are unsecured creditors, so when an exchange collapses, secured creditors are paid back first, along with legal fees,"" said Dustin Palmer, managing director at consulting firm Berkeley Research Group. ""Customers will be paid last on a pro rata basis. In a typical bankruptcy, this is pennies on the dollar.""""Customers will likely have to wait until the full bankruptcy process is complete before receiving remuneration, and bankruptcy usually lasts years,"" Palmer added. ""Lehman took years. Some Mt. Gox customers, for example, still haven't received any remuneration.""Saval added customer recoveries in bankruptcy proceedings ""may be further diluted by other unsecured creditors such as vendors, lessors and litigation claimants."" Investors can opt to move their crypto off an exchange into so-called ""self-custody"" wallets instead.This is where someone is responsible for their own private key, a secret password required for gaining access to a crypto wallet.Such a move comes with its own risks, however. If a crypto holder loses their private key, they may never be able to recover their funds.There have been countless examples of people who've lost hard drives or USB sticks containing troves of crypto worth millions."

Following these deposits, 17 victims received an email stating they had to pay taxes on their investments before withdrawing funds. Four victims could not withdraw funds.The FBI said another app, called Supayos, or Supay, asked for deposits and then froze one user's funds after telling him the minimum balance requirement was $900,000.More than 99% of Gen Z and 98% of millennials utilize mobile banking apps regularly, and the FBI encouraged investors and financial institutions to be wary of unsolicited requests to download investment apps.

This led to liquidity issues at Celsius and 3AC, two companies that made risky crypto gambles using borrowed funds.As cryptocurrencies started falling this year, investors wanted to take their funds out of firms like Celsius and 3AC. But a drop in the value of the assets held by such companies meant they were unable to process those redemption requests.

2022-07-20,"Nowadays, a surprising number of parents are planning to pay for college with crypto. Notably, 87% of parents who are saving for their kids' college say they have invested in crypto, according to a recent poll of 1,250 parents from the online magazine Intelligent.com.But is investing in crypto to pay for college a good idea? Certainly, there are caveats given its newness, volatility and unregulated status, according to investment professionals and crypto professionals. Here are four considerations if you're thinking of using crypto to help save for college.1. Use crypto in moderation for college fundingCrypto is still an emerging asset and it's subject to wild price swings. Notably, bitcoin has fallen a ton this year. Even with a recent rebound in bitcoin, the popular cryptocurrency has lost more than 70% of its value since its November all-time high of around $69,000. This means families need to proceed with caution when using crypto for their college-finding needs. Some financial advisors caution against it entirely, while others provide a greenlight, to a certain degree.""You don't want to gamble your child's ability to go to college on a speculative bet,"" said Ric Edelman, a financial advisor and founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals. Rather, he and other professionals contend that crypto should be part of a diversified portfolio, with an allocation of around 1% to 5%. ""You should have limited exposure. It should not the majority of your portfolio because of its volatility,"" said Howard Greenberg, president of the American Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association. 2. Understand your student's time horizonParents have to be careful about their time horizon, said Ben Weiss, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin ATM network CoinFlip. If you're sending a child to college next year, crypto is probably not a wise short-term investment, but if you have, say 10 years, crypto will probably grow a lot in that time frame. ""The longer time horizon you have, the more aggressive you can be with crypto,"" he said.Some financial advisors, however, still advise parents not to count on crypto, especially since it is still unregulated and there's a huge question over its inherent value. ""The unproven nature of crypto as an asset class makes it a risky investment"" to help pay for college, said Omar Qureshi, managing partner of Hightower Wealth Advisors in St. Louis. His advice: ""Invest what you can afford to lose and don't pin your hopes on paying for college by putting it in crypto.""3. Consider crypto tax implications and 529 plansDepending when you bought the crypto, you could owe a large tax liability, so you'll need to factor that into your college-financing decisions. Say, for instance, you invested in bitcoin 10 years ago and have since made a huge gain. When you sell your holdings, you'll have a large tax liability, Weiss said. Because of the tax implications, families would be smart to invest in stock funds within a 529 college savings plan, which is tax-advantaged, and use crypto, if desired, to supplement their college-funding needs, Edelman said. Crypto would have to outperform the stock market by about 50% in order to be as profitable, net of tax, as you would obtain by investing in stocks within a 529 plan, Edelman said.There are limited options for gaining exposure to crypto within a 529 account itself. A spokeswoman for the National Association of State Treasurers, an authority for state treasury programs, said the group isn't aware of any 529s that have direct cryptocurrency investments as investment options. Some plans may offer investments that provide limited exposure to crypto or blockchain technology.If you are looking for a tax-advantaged option to hold crypto to save for college, you might consider a self-directed Coverdell Education Savings Account. Just be aware of the low contribution limits and other restrictions associated with this type of account.4. Know your coin and cryptocurrency exchange optionsThere are dozens of different ways you can invest in crypto, either directly or through options that include funds of funds, hedge funds and exchange-traded funds that invest in bitcoin mining, for instance. The Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals has compiled a comprehensive list of investment options.If you plan to own the crypto directly, be sure to pay attention to quality. Weiss said families should stick to bitcoin and the ethereum cryptocurrency, known as ether, since they are the largest in terms of market capitalization. Also purchase the coins from well-known exchanges such as Coinbase or Gemini, Greenberg said.SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

But as institutional capital poured into digital assets, that thesis failed to materialize once the Fed began hiking interest rates and traders fled equities.A rally beyond $22,700 means the cryptocurrency has now recovered its 200-week moving average, laying the technical groundwork for a ""trend reversal,"" according to Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank.""The market needs a little more assurance for deceleration in the pace of rate hike by the Fed,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, a short-term outlook for bitcoin is bullish and it could go as high as around $29k this week.""Meanwhile, traders are betting that the worst of an intense market contagion caused by liquidity issues at some large crypto firms has likely subsided. Digital currencies have been under immense selling pressure in the past couple of months, as the collapse of some notable ventures caused ripple effects in the market. Terra, a so-called algorithmic stablecoin, plunged to near-zero in May, setting off a chain of events that ultimately led to the bankruptcies of crypto firms Celsius, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager.

""None of these assets are securities.""""Coinbase has a rigorous process to analyze and review each digital asset before making it available on our exchange — a process that the SEC itself has reviewed.""Whether some cryptocurrencies should be considered securities is a contentious matter that has flustered both regulators and crypto firms alike.Ripple, a San Francisco-based blockchain firm, is currently fighting a lawsuit from the SEC which claims XRP, a cryptocurrency it is closely associated with, should be treated as a security.It goes back to a notable Supreme Court case known as the Howey Test, which deems an asset as a security if it meets certain criteria. According to the SEC, a security is defined as ""an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.""The SEC's position is significant as it means Coinbase may be forced to classify some of the cryptocurrencies it offers as regulated financial instruments.The process of listing securities, such as shares in a company, involves rigorous disclosure and registration requirements. Cryptocurrencies, by contrast, are unregulated and therefore don't come with the same level of scrutiny.Coinbase has been known to be more conservative with its token listing framework than some other exchanges. Both Binance and FTX offer more than 300 coins, for example, while Coinbase lists just over 200, according to CoinGecko data.Nevertheless, the SEC believes the company is hosting unregulated securities on its platform, a claim that Coinbase denies.Caroline Pham, commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, also weighed in on the case Thursday, calling the SEC securities fraud charges a ""striking example of 'regulation by enforcement.'""

If the deal with Bithumb goes through, FTX will gain further foothold in Asia and in particular South Korea, where crypto trading is very popular.Bithumb is one of South Korea's largest exchanges. At its peak in the last 24 hours, it processed just over $500 million of trades, according to data from CoinGecko.

2022-07-26,"Shares of Coinbase closed down more than 21% Tuesday on report that it's facing SEC's probe into whether the platform is offering unregistered securities.This SEC probe came before and was separate from Coinbase's alleged insider trading scheme that led to the fraud charge of an ex-Coinbase product manager Thursday. Shares of Coinbase closed down more than 21% Tuesday on reports that it's facing an SEC probe into whether the platform is offering unregistered securities.Coinbase stock has lost more than 75% of its value this year.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing whether the company illegitimately let users trade digital assets that haven't been registered as securities, CNBC has confirmed with a source. The news was earlier reported by Bloomberg.""I'm happy to say it again and again: we are confident that our rigorous diligence process — a process the SEC has already reviewed — keeps securities off our platform,"" said Coinbase's chief legal officer Paul Grewal on Twitter. ""We look forward to engaging with the SEC on the matter.""This SEC probe reportedly happened before and was separate from Coinbase's alleged insider trading scheme that led to the fraud charges against an ex-Coinbase product manager and two other people Thursday. But SEC also filed a complaint the same day, claiming that nine of the 25 tokens allegedly traded in the scheme were securities.The argument over how to classify cryptocurrency tokens is controversial. Generally speaking, if cryptocurrencies are commodities (like other kinds of currency), they would be governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But many crypto projects are funded by the sale of tokens whose primary value is speculative. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that ""many of these underlying tokens have the attributes of securities"" and need to be regulated as such to protect investors. In the agency's recent lawsuit against the alleged insider trading scheme, the SEC wrote, ""A digital token or crypto asset is a crypto asset security if it meets the definition of a security, which the Securities Act defines to include 'investment contract,' i.e., if it constitutes an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.""Other crypto firms, such as San Francisco-based Ripple, are also fighting lawsuits from SEC.Compared to Binance and FTX, Coinbase is more selective with its token listings. Coinbase lists over 200 such tokens, according to CoinGecko data. Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProBitcoin just posted its worst week of the year.

The House on Thursday passed bipartisan legislation to boost U.S. competitiveness with China by allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing and science research.The bill passed 243-187, with no Democrats voting against the bill. Twenty-four Republicans voted for the legislation, even after a last-minute push by GOP leaders to oppose it.The bill, which passed the Senate on Wednesday, now heads to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law.It is ""exactly what we need to be doing to grow our economy right now,"" Biden said in a statement after the vote. ""I look forward to signing this bill into law.""Lawmakers pushed to quickly approve the package before they depart Washington, D.C., for the August recess. But the final vote came after years of wrangling on Capitol Hill, with the legislation taking numerous forms, and names, in both chambers of Congress. The ultimate version, known as the Chips and Science Act, includes more than $52 billion for U.S. companies producing computer chips, as well as billions more in tax credits to encourage investment in chip manufacturing. It also provides tens of billions of dollars to fund scientific research, and to spur the innovation and development of other U.S. technologies.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the bill ""a major victory for American families and the American economy.""But House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., urged his colleagues to ""reject this deeply flawed bill"" and ""start from scratch"" in floor remarks before the vote.The Senate passed the bill Wednesday in a 64-33 vote, drawing support from 17 Republicans.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., revealed that they have struck a deal on a sweeping reconciliation bill.""It's been a momentous 24 hours here in Congress, a legislative one-two punch that the American people rarely see,"" Schumer said in a post-vote victory lap Thursday afternoon.Schumer and Manchin hope to pass their reconciliation package next week with just a simple majority in the Senate, which is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats with Vice President Kamala Harris casting any tiebreaking votes.Shortly after that deal was announced, House Republican leaders urged their members to vote down the Chips and Science Act. They argued against giving multibillion-dollar subsidies to chipmakers at a time of historically high inflation, while also noting the timing of the Democrats' reconciliation deal.""The partisan Democrat agenda has given us record inflation, and now they are poised to send our country into a crushing recession,"" the office of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a memo Wednesday night.Republicans echoed that new stance during floor debates before the vote. Rep. Frank Lucas, the top Republican on the House Science Committee where many of the bill's provisions had first been hashed out, said he would regretfully vote against it because it has been ""irrevocably"" linked to the reconciliation plan.That committee's chairman, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, responded with a plea for all lawmakers to ""put aside politics"" and vote for the bipartisan bill.Some Republicans who opposed the bill on its own merits said it lacked ""guardrails"" to prevent any of the funding from winding up in China's hands. Other critics have argued that the U.S. would have to spend many billions more to have a real chance at competing with the world's leading chipmakers.But the bill's advocates say it is vital to America's economy and national security to build more chips, which are increasingly critical components in a vast array of products including consumer electronics, automobiles, health-care equipment and weapons systems.The chips have been in short supply during the Covid-19 pandemic. Factory shutdowns at the beginning of the outbreak sidelined chip production in Asia while consumer demand for autos and upgraded home electronics that need the chips surged during the lockdowns. The U.S. share of global chip production also has fallen sharply in recent decades, while China and other nations have invested heavily in the industry.The U.S. also makes few of the most advanced types of semiconductors, which are largely produced in Taiwan, the epicenter of rising political tensions with China.

2022-07-28,"Celebrity sisters Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian complained about the test version earlier this week.Instagram will still push algorithmically recommended videos and is trying to improve the technology.Meta recently reported second-quarter earnings that missed on both the top and the bottom. Meta is ending a test version of its Instagram app that earned the ire of many people, including celebrity sisters Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian.Instagram chief Adam Mosseri told the Platformer newsletter on Thursday that it would roll back its recently released version of Instagram that predominantly featured algorithmically recommended videos to users on their home screens.Numerous Instragram users, including the Kardashian sisters, complained about the test version of Instagram, voicing frustration that the app was overtly copying rival TikTok while distancing itself from its photo-sharing roots.Mosseri then released a short video on Tuesday responding to critics in which he said that photos will continue playing an important role for Instagram, but changing user habits favor video. In other words, Instagram will continue pushing into video because people are increasingly sharing and liking videos on the app, he explained.But apparently the backlash against the test version of a video-focused Instagram led to Mosseri and his team temporarily reversing course.""I'm glad we took a risk — if we're not failing every once in a while, we're not thinking big enough or bold enough,"" Mosseri told Platformer.

2022-07-29,"Developers gathered for various crypto events in Paris last week told CNBC the days of cheap money in crypto are over.Much of the lending corner of the crypto market operates in a black box.Voyager Digital and Celsius competed for users on APY, but a lot of the so-called yield they offered customers wasn't real. PARIS — Celsius and Voyager Digital were once two of the biggest names in the crypto lending space, because they offered retail investors outrageous annual returns, sometimes approaching 20%. Now, both are bankrupt, as a crash in token prices — coupled with an erosion of liquidity following a series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve — exposed these and other projects promising unsustainable yields.""$3 trillion of liquidity will likely be taken out of markets globally by central banks over the next 18 months,"" said Alkesh Shah, a global crypto and digital asset strategist at Bank of America.But the washout of easy money is being welcomed by some of the world's top blockchain developers who say that leverage is a drug attracting people looking to make a quick buck — and it takes a system failure of this magnitude to clear out the bad actors.""If there's something to learn from this implosion, it is that you should be very wary of people who are very arrogant,"" Eylon Aviv told CNBC from the sidelines of EthCC, an annual conference that draws developers and cryptographers to Paris for a week.""This is one of the common denominators between all of them. It is sort of like a God complex — 'I'm going to build the best thing, I'm going to be amazing, and I just became a billionaire,'"" continued Aviv, who is a principal at Collider Ventures, an early-stage venture capital blockchain and crypto fund based in Tel Aviv.Much of the turmoil we've seen grip crypto markets since May can be traced back to these multibillion-dollar crypto companies with centralized figureheads who call the shots.""The liquidity crunch affected DeFi yields, but it was a few irresponsible central actors that exacerbated this,"" said Walter Teng, a Digital Asset Strategy Associate at Fundstrat Global Advisors. Back when the Fed's benchmark rate was virtually zero and government bonds and savings accounts were paying out nominal returns, a lot of people turned to crypto lending platforms instead.During the boom in digital asset prices, retail investors were able to earn outlandish returns by parking their tokens on now defunct platforms like Celsius and Voyager Digital, as well as Anchor, which was the flagship lending product of a since failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project called TerraUSD that offered up to 20% annual percentage yields.The system worked when crypto prices were at record highs, and it was virtually free to borrow cash.But as research firm Bernstein noted in a recent report, the crypto market, like other risk-on assets, is tightly correlated to Fed policy. And indeed in the last few months, bitcoin along with other major cap tokens have been falling in tandem with these Fed rate hikes.In an effort to contain spiraling inflation, the Fed hiked its benchmark rate by another 0.75% on Wednesday, taking the funds rate to its highest level in nearly four years.Technologists gathered in Paris tell CNBC that sucking out the liquidity that's been sloshing around the system for years means an end to the days of cheap money in crypto.""We expect greater regulatory protections and required disclosures supporting yields over the next six to twelve months, likely reducing the current high DeFi yields,"" said Shah.Some platforms put client funds into other platforms that similarly offered unrealistic returns, in a sort of dangerous arrangement wherein one break would upend the entire chain. One report drawing on blockchain analytics found that Celsius had at least half a billion dollars invested in the Anchor protocol which offered up to 20% APY to customers.""The domino effect is just like interbank risk,"" explained Nik Bhatia, professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California. ""If credit has been extended that isn't properly collateralized or reserved against, failure will beget failure.""Celsius, which had $25 billion in assets under management less than a year ago, is also being accused of operating a Ponzi scheme by paying early depositors with the money it got from new users. So far, the fallout in the crypto market has been contained to a very specific corner of the ecosystem known as centralized finance, or CeFi, which is different to decentralized finance, or DeFi.Though decentralization exists along a spectrum and there is no binary designation separating CeFi from DeFi platforms, there are a few hallmark features which help to place platforms into one of the two camps. CeFi lenders typically adopt a top-down approach wherein a few powerful voices dictate financial flows and how various parts of a platform work, and often operate in a sort of ""black box"" where borrowers don't really know how the platform functions. In contrast, DeFi platforms cut out middlemen like lawyers and banks and rely upon code for enforcement. A big part of the problem with CeFi crypto lenders was a lack of collateral to backstop loans. In Celsius' bankruptcy filing, for example, it shows that the company had more than 100,000 creditors, some of whom lent the platform cash without receiving the rights to any collateral to back up the arrangement.Without real cash behind these loans, the entire arrangement depended upon trust — and the continued flow of easy money to keep it all afloat.In DeFi, however, borrowers put in more than 100% collateral to backstop the loan. Platforms require this because DeFi is anonymous: Lenders don't know the borrower's name or credit score, nor do they have any other real-world metadata about their cash flow or capital upon which to base their decision to extend a loan. Instead, the only thing that matters is the collateral a customer is able to post.With DeFi, instead of centralized players calling the shots, the exchanges of money are managed by a programmable piece of code called a smart contract. This contract is written on a public blockchain, like ethereum or solana, and it executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary. Consequently, the annual returns advertised by DeFi platforms like Aave and Compound are much lower than what Celsius and Voyager once offered customers, and their rates vary based upon market forces, rather than staying fixed at unsustainable double-digit percentages.The tokens associated with these lending protocols are both massively up in the last month, which is a reflection of the enthusiasm for this corner of the crypto ecosystem.""Gross yields (APR/APY) in DeFi are derived from token prices of relevant altcoins that are attributed to different liquidity pools, the prices of which we have seen tumble more than 70% since November,"" explained Fundstrat's Teng.In practice, DeFi loans function more like sophisticated trading products, rather than a standard loan.""That's not a retail or mom-and-pop product. You have to be quite advanced and have a take on the market,"" said Otto Jacobsson, who worked in debt capital markets at a bank in London for three years, before transitioning into crypto.Teng believes lenders who did not aggressively extend uncollateralized loans, or have since liquidated their counterparties, will remain solvent. Genesis' Michael Moro, for example, has come out to say they have cut significant counter-party risk.""Rates offered to creditors will, and have, compressed. However, lending remains a hugely profitable business (second only to exchange trading), and prudent risk managers will survive the crypto winter,"" said Teng.In fact Celsius, though itself a CeFi lender, also diversified its holdings in the DeFi ecosystem by parking some of its crypto cash in these decentralized finance platforms as a way to earn yield. Days before declaring bankruptcy, Celsius began to pay back many of its liens with DeFi lenders like Maker and Aave, in order to unlock its collateral.""This is actually the biggest advertisement to date of how smart contracts work,"" explained Andrew Keys, co-founder of Darma Capital, which invests in applications, developer tools, and protocols around ethereum.""The fact that Celsius is paying back Aave, Compound, and Maker before humans should explain smart contracts to humanity,"" continued Keys. ""These are persistent software objects that are non-negotiable."""
2022-07-29,"From Starbucks to Lamborghinis, consumers are using cryptocurrency to pay for a variety of goods — and retailers are taking notice.Nearly 75% of retailers plan to accept either cryptocurrency or stablecoin payments within the next two years, according to a June survey conducted by Deloitte titled ""Merchants getting ready for crypto."" Deloitte polled a sample of 2,000 senior executives from the retail industry who represent a range of subsectors including cosmetics, electronics, fashion, transportation, food and beverage.While digital currencies like Bitcoin are typically only as valuable as users believe them to be, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that derives its value from an underlying asset. Stablecoins are often pegged to currencies such as the U.S. dollar or a commodity such as gold.Although paying with cryptocurrency is fairly novel now, 83% of retailers expect consumer interest in digital currencies to increase over the next year and a little over half of them have invested over $1 million into enabling digital payments, according to the survey.For consumers, that means you could soon buy clothes, drinks, beauty products and more with crypto. Although retailers are planning to accept digital currency as payments, that doesn't mean they're necessarily planning to hold on to the virtual assets.Just over 50% of respondents plan to have third-party payment processors convert digital currency into fiat, which is money that is established as legal tender by a government, like the U.S. dollar, the British pound and the euro. This means the retailers aren't planning to actually own the cryptocurrency that's used for payment.Given the unpredictability of the crypto market, using this strategy is considered to be less risky for retailers than holding the crypto themselves. This approach also makes it faster and easier for retailers to enable payments with digital currencies, Deloitte reports. Crypto-curious retailers recognize that there are a number of challenges to overcome in order to enable payments with digital currencies. Nearly 90% cited the complexity of making their existing financial infrastructure compatible with various digital currencies as their greatest challenge.Additionally, security of the payment platforms topped the list of barriers to adoption, the survey revealed, followed by concerns about the changing regulatory landscape and the instability of the digital currency market.More than half of retailers agreed that certain regulations regarding cryptocurrency need to be enacted, including national guidance around holding digital assets, clarity about the tax implications of using digital currencies and the ability to hold digital currencies in a bank account. Despite their worries, retailers remain optimistic about the benefits of enabling payments with cryptocurrencies. Nearly half of retailers believe this move will improve customer experience and increase their customer base. ""We anticipate that further partnerships with regulated and established institutions in the industry will help deliver the benefits of digital currencies (e.g., convenience and support) and will continue to build the necessary foundation of trust,"" the report concludes.While the ability to pay with crypto may be good news for some crypto users, it's still important to remember that these assets can be highly volatile, and experts typically recommend only investing as much money as you are prepared to lose.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Fake crypto apps have stolen over $42 million from investors in under a year, warns FBI—how to stay safe"
2022-08-02,"Hackers yanked almost $200 million in crypto from Nomad, a so-called blockchain bridge.Blockchain bridges allow users to transfer tokens from one network to another.They've become a prime target for hackers seeking to swindle investors out of millions. Hackers drained almost $200 million in cryptocurrency from Nomad, a tool that lets users swap tokens from one blockchain to another, in yet another attack highlighting weaknesses in the decentralized finance space.Nomad acknowledged the exploit in a tweet late Monday.""We are aware of the incident involving the Nomad token bridge,"" the startup said. ""We are currently investigating and will provide updates when we have them.""It's not entirely clear how the attack was orchestrated, or if Nomad plans to reimburse users who lost tokens in the attack. The company, which markets itself as a ""secure cross-chain messaging"" service, wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.Blockchain security experts described the exploit as a ""free-for-all."" Anyone with knowledge of the exploit and how it worked could seize on the flaw and withdraw an amount of tokens from Nomad — sort of like a cash machine spewing out money at the tap of a button.It started with an upgrade to Nomad's code. One part of the code was marked as valid whenever users decided to initiate a transfer, which allowed thieves to withdraw more assets than were deposited into the platform. Once other attackers cottoned on to what was going on, they deployed armies of bots to carry out copycat attacks.""Without prior programming experience, any user could simply copy the original attackers' transaction call data and substitute the address with theirs to exploit the protocol,"" said Victor Young, founder and chief architect of crypto startup Analog. ""Unlike previous attacks, the Nomad hack became a free-for-all where multiple users started to drain the network by simply replaying the original attackers' transaction call data.""Sam Sun, research partner at crypto-focused investment firm Paradigm, described the exploit as ""one of the most chaotic hacks that Web3 has ever seen"" — Web3 being a hypothetical future iteration of the internet built around blockchain technology.Nomad is what's known as a ""bridge,"" a tool that lets users exchange tokens and information between different crypto networks. They're used as an alternative to making transactions directly on a blockchain like Ethereum, which can charge users high processing fees when there's lots of activity happening at once.Instances of vulnerabilities and poor design have made bridges a prime target for hackers seeking to swindle investors out of millions. More than $1 billion in crypto assets has been stolen through bridge exploits so far in 2022, according to a report from crypto compliance firm Elliptic.In April, a blockchain bridge called Ronin was exploited in a $600 million crypto heist, which U.S. officials have since attributed to the North Korean state. Some months later, Harmony, another bridge, was drained of $100 million in a similar attack.Like Ronin and Harmony, Nomad was targeted through a flaw in its code — but there were a few differences. With those attacks, hackers were able to retrieve the private keys needed to gain control over the network and start moving out tokens. In Nomad's case, it was much simpler than that. A routine update to the bridge enabled users to forge transactions and make off with millions' worth of crypto."
2022-08-02,"Bankrupt lending platform Celsius wants to bring back ex-CFO Rod Bolger and pay him about $92,000 a month, prorated over a period of at least six weeks.The company says it needs Bolger to help it navigate bankruptcy proceedings as an advisor, according to a motion filed with the Southern District of New York. Embattled lending platform Celsius wants to bring back ex-CFO Rod Bolger and pay him about $92,000 a month, prorated over a period of at least six weeks. The embattled lender says it needs Bolger to help it navigate bankruptcy proceedings as an advisor, according to a motion filed with the Southern District of New York.""Because of Mr. Bolger's familiarity with the Debtors' business, the Debtors have requested, and Mr. Bolger has agreed pending the Court's approval, to continue providing advisory and consulting services to the Debtors pursuant to an Advisory Agreement,"" the filing reads. ""In consideration for the advisory services rendered by Mr. Bolger, the Debtors agree to pay Mr. Bolger the sum of CAD $120,000 per month, prorated for partial months.""The motion goes on to say that during Bolger's tenure, he led efforts to steady the business during turbulent market volatility this year, guiding the financial aspects of the business and acting as a leader of the company. Ultimately, it is up to New York's Southern District to decide whether to allow Bolger to come onboard with Celsius. There is a Zoom hearing set for Monday, Aug. 8, to consider the motion.Bolger, a former CFO for Royal Bank of Canada and divisions of Bank of America, was previously with the company for five months before resigning on June 30, about three weeks after the platform paused all withdrawals, citing ""extreme market conditions."" While he worked full-time with the company as CFO, this motion shows that he had a base salary of $750,000 and a performance-based cash bonus of up to 75% of his base, in addition to stock and token options, bringing the top of his total income range to around $1.3 million.The company subsequently installed Chris Ferraro, then the head of financial planning, analysis, and investor relations for Celsius, to the post of CFO. Within days of his appointment, the company filed for bankruptcy.Once a titan of the crypto lending world, Celsius is in bankruptcy proceedings and facing down claims that it was running a Ponzi scheme by paying early depositors with the money it got from new users.At its peak in October 2021, CEO Alex Mashinsky said the crypto lender had $25 billion in assets under management. Now, Celsius is down to $167 million ""in cash on hand,"" which it says will provide ""ample liquidity"" to support operations during the restructuring process. Celsius owes its users around $4.7 billion, according to its bankruptcy filing.That filing also shows that Celsius has more than 100,000 creditors, some of whom lent the platform cash without any collateral to back up the arrangement. The list of its top 50 unsecured creditors includes Sam Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research, as well as an investment firm based in the Cayman Islands.Retail investors have filed pleas to the judge to help them recover some of their lost holdings, with some saying that their life savings have effectively been wiped out.A CPA and Celsius investor with a large balance trapped on the Celsius platform filed an objection on Tuesday to challenge the motion by Celsius to reinstate its former CFO."
2022-08-02,"Robinhood's crypto division was fined $30 million for ""significant failures"" in areas of anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations.NYDFS alleged that Robinhood Crypto's anti-money laundering and cybersecurity program was inadequately staffed and did not have sufficient resources to address risks.This is the first crypto-sector enforcement by the New York State Department of Financial Services The New York State Department of Financial Services announced on Tuesday it has issued a $30 million penalty against Robinhood's crypto division.NYDFS, the government branch that's responsible for regulating financial services and products, alleged that Robinhood Crypto's anti-money laundering and cybersecurity program was inadequately staffed and did not have sufficient resources to address risks. It also alleged Robinhood's crypto division failed to timely transition from a manual transaction monitoring system to one more adequate for its user size and transaction volume.The $30 million penalty is NYDFS's first crypto-sector enforcement. Robinhood said last year that it was expecting to pay a $30 million settlement to NYDFS after a 2020 investigation focusing on anti-money laundering and cybersecurity-related issues.The regulator claimed Robinhood Crypto violated the law when, despite the alleged issues, it certified compliance with the department. Robinhood Crypto also allegedly breached consumer protection requirements when it failed to maintain a distinct and dedicated phone number on its website for consumer complaints.Robinhood Crypto will have to retain an independent consultant to evaluate its compliance with related regulations.""As its business grew, Robinhood Crypto failed to invest the proper resources and attention to develop and maintain a culture of compliance—a failure that resulted in significant violations of the Department's anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations,"" said NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris.The fine is the latest in a slew of monetary penalties that regulators imposed on Robinhood. In 2020, Robinhood paid $65 million to settle an SEC probe over misleading customers. In 2021, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) fined Robinhood $70 million for outages and misleading customers.""We are pleased the settlement in principle reached last year and previously disclosed in our public filings is now final,"" said Cheryl Crumpton, associate general counsel of litigation and regulatory enforcement at Robinhood.The company has made ""significant progress"" in building its legal, compliance and cybersecurity programs, Crumpton added."
2022-08-03,"The first three days of August have been beset by a multitude of negative stories in the land of crypto.Hackers stole millions of dollars worth of tokens from investors, while the Securities and Exchange Commission is clamping down on crypto Ponzi schemes.The developments add to an already torrid year for the crypto market, which has seen huge declines as fears around tightening monetary policy set in. It has been a rough month for the crypto sector, and it's only the third day of August.From cross-chain bridge hacks draining hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds to the Securities and Exchange Commission coming after crypto Ponzi schemes, this corner of the market can't catch a break.The developments add to an already torrid year for the crypto market, which has seen huge declines as fears around tightening monetary policy and a lack of liquidity set in.The flood of news is difficult for even insiders to track, so here's a rundown of what you've missed since Monday. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday filed a civil complaint charging 11 people in the creation and promotion of an allegedly fraudulent crypto-focused pyramid scheme that raised more than $300 million from investors.The scheme, called Forsage, claimed to be a decentralized smart contract platform, allowing millions of retail investors to enter into transactions via smart contracts that operated on the ethereum, tron and binance blockchains. The SEC alleges that for more than two years, the setup functioned like a standard pyramid scheme, in which investors earned profits by recruiting others into the operation. In the SEC's formal complaint, Wall Street's top watchdog calls Forsage a ""textbook pyramid and Ponzi scheme,"" in which Forsage aggressively promoted its smart contracts through online promotions and new investment platforms, all while not selling ""any actual, consumable product."" The complaint adds that ""the primary way for investors to make money from Forsage was to recruit others into the scheme.""The SEC said Forsage operated a typical Ponzi structure, wherein it allegedly used assets from new investors to pay earlier ones.""As the complaint alleges, Forsage is a fraudulent pyramid scheme launched on a massive scale and aggressively marketed to investors,"" Carolyn Welshhans, acting chief of the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, wrote in a news release.""Fraudsters cannot circumvent the federal securities laws by focusing their schemes on smart contracts and blockchains.""Forsage, through its support platform, declined to provide a method for contacting the company and did not offer comment.Four of the 11 people charged by the SEC are founders of Forsage. Their current whereabouts are unknown, but they were last known to be living in Russia, the Republic of Georgia and Indonesia.Three of the 11 people are U.S.-based individuals charged as promoters who endorsed Forsage on their social media platforms: Samuel D. Ellis, of Louisville, Kentucky, Mark F. Hamlin, of Henrico, Virginia, and Sarah L. Theissen, of Hartford, Wisconsin. Ellis and Theissen, neither of whom admitted nor denied the allegations, agreed to settle the charges, subject to court approval.Forsage was launched in January 2020. Regulators around the world have tried a couple of times to shut it down. Cease-and-desist actions were brought against Forsage first in September 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines. In March 2021, Montana's commissioner of securities and insurance tried the same. Despite this, the defendants allegedly continued to promote the scheme while denying the claims in several YouTube videos and by other means. Crypto startup Nomad lost almost $200 million in a devastating security exploit. Nomad is known as a ""bridge,"" where users can transfer tokens from one blockchain to another. Hackers exploited a security flaw that let users enter any value into the system and siphon off the funds, even if there weren't enough assets available in Nomad's deposit base.The nature of the bug meant that users didn't need any programming skills to exploit it. Others caught on and deployed armies of bots to carry out copycat attacks.""Without prior programming experience, any user could simply copy the original attackers' transaction call data and substitute the address with theirs to exploit the protocol,"" said Victor Young, founder and chief architect of crypto startup Analog.""Unlike previous attacks, the Nomad hack became a free-for-all where multiple users started to drain the network by simply replaying the original attackers' transaction call data.""Blockchain bridges are a popular way of moving tokens off networks such as ethereum, which has gained a reputation for slow transaction times and high fees, into cheaper, more efficient blockchains. But sloppy programming choices have made them a prime target for hackers seeking to swindle investors out of millions. More than $1 billion worth of crypto has been lost to bridge exploits so far in 2022, according to blockchain analysis firm Elliptic.""I can only hope that developers and projects will learn that they are running a critical piece of software,"" Adrian Hetman, tech lead at Web3 security firm Immunefi, told CNBC.""They need to keep the security first, be security first at every business decision because they are dealing with people's money; a lot of that money is locked in those contracts.""Nomad said it's working with crypto security firm TRM Labs and law enforcement to trace the movement of funds, identify the perpetrators behind the attack and return stolen tokens to users.""Nomad is committed to keeping its community updated as it learns more in the coming hours and days and appreciates all those who acted quickly to protect funds,"" the company said in the statement. Later Tuesday, MicroStrategy announced CEO Michael Saylor is leaving his role to become executive chairman of the company. The company's president, Phong Le, will take the reins from Saylor.Saylor has been the CEO since he launched the company in 1989. MicroStrategy went public in 1998.MicroStrategy's stock is down over 48% this year. Bitcoin is down over 51% during that same time period.""I believe that splitting the roles of Chairman and CEO will enable us to better pursue our two corporate strategies of acquiring and holding bitcoin and growing our enterprise analytics software business,"" Saylor said in a news release. ""As Executive Chairman I will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives, while Phong will be empowered as CEO to manage overall corporate operations."" The news came as the company announced its second-quarter earnings, in which its total revenues dropped by 2.6% compared with a year ago. The company also reported an impairment charge of $918 million on the value of its digital assets, presumably primarily bitcoin.MicroStrategy may technically be in the business of enterprise software and cloud-based services, but Saylor has said the publicly traded company doubles as the first and only bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S.""We're kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF,"" Saylor told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami in April. And then on Tuesday night, unknown attackers came after hot wallets connected to the solana blockchain.Nearly 8,000 digital wallets have been drained of just over $5.2 million in digital coins, including solana's sol token and USD coin, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The Twitter account Solana Status confirmed the attack, noting that as of Wednesday morning, approximately 7,767 wallets have been affected by the exploit. Elliptic's estimate is slightly higher at 7,936 wallets.Solana's sol token, one of the largest cryptocurrencies after bitcoin and ether, fell about 8% in the first two hours after the hack was initially detected, according to data from CoinMarketCap. It's currently down about 1%, while trading volume is up about 105% in the last 24 hours.Starting Tuesday evening, multiple users began reporting that assets held in ""hot"" wallets — that is, internet-connected addresses, including Phantom, Slope and Trust Wallet — had been emptied of funds.Phantom said on Twitter that it's investigating the ""reported vulnerability in the solana ecosystem"" and doesn't believe it's a Phantom-specific issue. Blockchain audit firm OtterSec tweeted that the hack has affected multiple wallets ""across a wide variety of platforms.""Elliptic chief scientist Tom Robinson told CNBC the root cause of the breach is still unclear, but ""it appears to be due to a flaw in certain wallet software, rather than in the solana blockchain itself."" OtterSec added that the transactions were being signed by the actual owners, ""suggesting some sort of private key compromise."" A private key is a secure code that grants the owner access to their crypto holdings.The identity of the attacker is still unknown, as is the root cause of the exploit. The breach is ongoing.""Engineers from multiple ecosystems, with the help of several security firms, are investigating drained wallets on solana,"" according to Solana Status, a Twitter account that shares updates for the entire solana network.The solana network is strongly encouraging users to use hardware wallets, since there's no evidence those have been impacted.""Do not reuse your seed phrase on a hardware wallet — create a new seed phrase.

A seed phrase is a fingerprint of all of a user's blockchain assets that is used as a backup if a crypto wallet is lost.The solana network was viewed as one of the most promising newcomers in the crypto market, with backers such as Chamath Palihapitiya and Andreessen Horowitz touting it as a challenger to ethereum with faster transaction processing times and enhanced security. But it's been faced with a spate of issues lately, including downtime in periods of activity and a perception of being more centralized than ethereum.Correction: This story has been updated to name the three defendants the SEC is charging as U.S.-based promoters who endorsed Forsage on their social media platforms. A previous version incorrectly said these defendants were not named in the SEC's press release that announced the charges. "
2022-08-03,"CEO Steven Ehrlich made over $30 million disposing of Voyager equity as the now-bankrupt crypto lender's shares neared an all-time high in spring 2021.The firm ran into trouble earlier this year after crypto prices plummeted, and froze customer assets before declaring bankruptcy in July.Voyager had custody of $1.3 billion in customer crypto assets spread across 3.5 million active users, according to a bankruptcy filing. Stephen Ehrlich, CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange Voyager Digital, made millions of dollars selling Voyager shares in February and March 2021 when shares were near their peak, nineteen months before the crypto lending firm declared bankruptcy in July 2022, financial records show.Ehrlich's gains were propelled by the stratospheric increase in Voyager's stock price, which rocketed from seven cents a share in Oct. 2020 to $26 a share by March 2021. In the same period, Bitcoin rose 455% and Ether climbed 688%. Like similarly embattled Celsius, the firm promised mammoth returns on assets that users entrusted with them. But as crypto prices went into free fall earlier this year, Voyager's business proved unsustainable, leading the firm to freeze assets that retail investors had deposited in June, then declare bankruptcy in July. Voyager had custody of $1.3 billion in customer crypto assets spread across 3.5 million active users, according to a bankruptcy filing.A complex and opaque corporate structure – including a reverse takeover of a defunct Canadian mining corporation, the acquisition and disposition of Delaware limited liability companies, and consulting fees paid out to insider LLCs – make it challenging to establish just how much the Voyager co-founder took home.What is evident, based on corporate insider disclosures and Voyager filings, is that Ehrlich made over $30 million disposing of Voyager equity as the crypto lender's shares neared an all-time high.Ehrlich and his Delaware LLCs sold nearly 1.9 million shares from February 9, 2021, to March 31, 2021, in 11 separate sales which totaled $31 million, according to data from the Canadian Securities Administration.The three largest of Ehrlich's transactions – totaling 1.4 million shares worth nearly $19 million –  were connected to a $50,000,000 secondary offering by Stifel Nicolaus in February 2021.Voyager shares would peak at $29.86 a week after Ehrlich's final sale on April 5, 2021. Three weeks later, VOYG shares had lost 41% of their value. By November 2021 — as the crypto market overall was peaking —Voyager was down 69% from its peak.Many publicly traded companies have restrictions or pre-determined trading plans on when senior executives and insiders can execute sales. In the United States, these 10b5-1 plans prevent insiders from using ""material non-public information"" to gain an advantage or profit. In Canada, these plans are known as automatic securities disposition plans, or ADSPs.On December 31, 2021, months after these insider sales, Voyager announced the adoption of ADSPs for Ehrlich and another executive, COO Gerard Hanshe. Less than a month later, on January 20, 2022, Ehrlich announced the cancellation of the ADSPs before any trades were completed under them.""Despite having a floor significantly above the current stock price, I felt it was in the best interest of the investors to withdraw the plan,"" Ehrlich said in a press release. ""Based on our key financial metrics, including revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 as disclosed in our press release issued January 5, 2022, I believe Voyager is undervalued.""Ehrlich did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Voyager ran into trouble earlier this year as crypto prices dropped more than 70% from their peak last fall. In particular, the collapse of a stablecoin, Terra, which was supposed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, sent shockwaves through the industry.Voyager disclosed to creditors on June 27 that hedge fund Three Arrows Capital had defaulted on a $650 million loan that Voyager had extended using customer assets. At the time, Voyager insisted it would continue to honor customer withdrawals and redemptions.Five days later, Ehrlich's firm froze customer withdrawals, leaving millions of users without access to their cryptoassets. ""This was a tremendously difficult decision, but we believe it is the right one given current market conditions,"" Ehrlich said in a statement.On July 6, the crypto lender filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, engaging white-shoe firm Kirkland and Ellis and investment bank Moelis & Company to advise them through the process. Numerous petitioners have moved to regain access to their holdings since the process began.The FDIC has since ordered Voyager to cease calling their products FDIC-insured, calling the claims ""false and misleading.""

2022-08-04,"Gold prices climbed over 1% to hit a fresh one-month peak on Thursday underpinned by a retreat in the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields, and as investors kept a close tab on U.S.-China tensions.Spot gold was up 1.6% to $1,793.34 per ounce, having risen to its highest since July 5 earlier. U.S. gold futures jumped 1.89% to $1,810.90 per ounce.""As of late, yields are coming down slightly, that has been along with the dollar's recent weakness one of the key benefits to gold,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.The dollar's retreat bolstered gold's appeal among overseas buyers, while benchmark U.S. Treasury yields also slipped, reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.""We've seen some rising tensions between the U.S. and China, so one additional reason why gold has been well supported coming into the morning,"" Meger added.China fired multiple missiles near Taiwan in its biggest ever military drills in the Taiwan Strait, a day after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the self-ruled island.Investors also took stock of data which showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased last week.

2022-08-09,"Voyager Digital bankruptcy court proceedings and financial documents show a complex relationship between the company and Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto firms. Lawyers from the two sides firms sparred in court Thursday over the FTX bid to buy Voyager.Documents reviewed by CNBC show the financial relationship between Alameda and Voyager date back to mid-2021.  Sam Bankman-Fried became a crypto billionaire and one of the most famous players in the industry by building cryptocurrency exchange FTX into a top site used by traders and investors.His company was valued at $32 billion in January and currently has more than a million users averaging a total of nearly $10 billion in daily trading volume. But it's still privately held, so the public doesn't know how badly it's been harmed by the ""crypto winter"" of the last few months. As a point of reference, Coinbase, which is public, has lost roughly two-thirds of its value this year, and mining company Marathon Digital is down by more than half.While Bankman-Fried, who lives in the Bahamas, has the financial benefit of opacity, his exposure to the broader industry washout became readily apparent last week during a five-hour Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearing in the Southern District of New York for beleaguered crypto brokerage Voyager Digital.Voyager is among a growing crop of crypto firms to seek bankruptcy protection amid a flood of client withdrawals that followed the plunge in bitcoin, ethereum and other digital currencies. Bankman-Fried's role in the morass is further complicated, because he also controls quantitative trading firm Alameda Research, which borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from Voyager and became a major equity investor before turning around and offering a bailout package to the firm.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is trying to play the role of industry consolidator, snapping up distressed assets both as a wager on their eventual recovery and to strengthen his foothold in the U.S. In July, FTX agreed on an option to buy crypto lending company BlockFi, and two months earlier Bankman-Fried disclosed a 7.6% stake in beaten-down trading app Robinhood. Bloomberg even reported that FTX was trying to buy Robinhood, though Bankman-Fried has denied any active discussions are underway. Outside of the U.S., FTX bought Japanese crypto exchange Liquid and has been in discussions to acquire the owner of South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb.With his activity on hyperdrive, it's become abundantly clear that Bankman-Fried is not immune to the contagion that's infected the cryptocurrency industry.Last week, lawyers for Alameda Research and Voyager tussled in court over what was revealed to be a deep and complex relationship between the two companies. Documents reviewed by CNBC show ties that extend as far back as September 2021. In Voyager's bankruptcy documents, the firm divulged that Alameda owed the company over $370 million but didn't say how long Alameda had been a Voyager borrower.Voyager filed for bankruptcy in early July after suffering huge losses from its exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, also known as 3AC, which went under after defaulting on loans from a number of firms in the industry — including over $650 million from Voyager.Voyager's court documents and financial statements show that Alameda moved from a borrower to a lender in the span of a few weeks after the 3AC debacle left Voyager in a desperate spot. Bankman-Fried's firm provided a $500 million bailout to Voyager in late June.Joshua Sussberg, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis representing Voyager, said in court that Bankman-Fried ""wore many hats"" during Voyager's rapid journey from prosperity to bankruptcy. In fact, a few weeks after Voyager's bankruptcy filing, FTX and Alameda jointly moved in as a potential bidder for Voyager's customer accounts, with Bankman-Fried saying his priority was to offer them liquidity.Bankman-Fried took to Twitter to make his case, turning a typically boring process into somewhat of a circus. Voyager's legal team wasn't pleased and suggested that the billionaire was trying to create leverage for himself in a potential transaction.""Parties in our process have expressly made concerns aware to us that FTX has a leg up and is working behind the scenes to force its way,"" he said. ""I want to assure all parties, the court and our customers, that we will not stand for that.""Andrew Dietderich, Alameda's lawyer and a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, said the rescue deal provided a faster timeline than Voyager's, yet it had been ""rejected violently.""Michael Wiles, U.S. bankruptcy judge for the Southern District of New York, didn't like where the arguments were headed.In addressing the lawyers, Wiles said he had no intention of turning the hearings into ""a sort of cable news show with people slinging accusations at each other and making extremely characterized descriptions of what their prior proposals or discussions were."" Attorneys from Alameda acknowledged that the business ties between Voyager and their client ran deeper than a simple lending relationship, and that the firm borrowed about $377 million from Voyager.Voyager's financial documents, which are public because the company's stock traded in Canada, appear to show that Alameda had initially borrowed significantly more than that. The firm's December 2021 books refer to a $1.6 billion crypto asset loan, with rates from 1% to 11%, to an entity based in the British Virgin Islands.Alameda is registered in the British Virgin Islands, with head offices in Tortola, and is the only counterparty located there. It was one of at least seven entities that borrowed heavily from Voyager. The same Voyager document that disclosed 3AC's default also lists a ""Counterparty A,"" a British Virgin Islands-registered firm, as owing Voyager $376.784 million. In the company's bankruptcy presentation, the firm lists Alameda as owing Voyager $377 million. In another filing, that loan amount is tied to a firm with borrowing rates of 1% to 11.5%.A Voyager representative declined to comment. Alameda didn't respond to a request for comment. Loan balances to the British Virgin Islands-based fund fell to $728 million in March 2022, representing 36% of Voyager's loaned crypto assets, before dropping to roughly $377 million three months later. Disclosure data was provided by FactSet and sourced from Canadian securities administrators.Voyager's relationship with Alameda would quickly turn from lender to borrower, as 3AC's default on the $654 million it owed Voyager brought the firm to the ground.Alameda stepped in with a bailout on June 22, but with restrictions. The $500 million rescue — $200 million in cash and USDC and roughly $300 million in bitcoin, based on prevailing market prices — had a capped rate of withdrawal, limiting the funding amount to $75 million over a 30-day period.Alameda attorneys said in court on Thursday that the loan was given ""on an unsecured basis"" at the specific request of Voyager management.By that time, Bankman-Fried was already a major stakeholder in Voyager through two equity investments from Alameda.In late 2021, Alameda closed a $75 million stock purchase, obtaining 7.72 million shares at $9.71 a piece, according to Voyager's filing for the period ended Dec. 31. In May of this year, Alameda spent another $35 million on about 15 million shares, with the stock price having plunged to $2.34.The combined purchases gave Alameda an 11.56% stake in Voyager and made it the largest shareholder. By the following month, when Alameda completed the bailout, its $110 million equity investment was worth only about $17 million.As a holder of at least 10% of Voyager's equity, Alameda was required to file disclosures with Canadian securities regulators. But on June 22, the day of the rescue, Alameda surrendered a block of 4.5 million shares, bringing its ownership down to 9.49% and nullifying reporting requirements, per Canadian regulation and Voyager's own filing. That same filing shows the surrendered shares ""were subsequently cancelled by Voyager.""Disclosure of the sale indicated that, in pulling its ownership below the 10% threshold, Alameda was giving away a 2.29% stake worth some $2.6 million. Neither Bankman-Fried's equity infusion nor bailout funding could stem the tide as customer redemptions swallowed Voyager's cash. Nine days after announcing the $500 million package, Voyager froze customer withdrawals and trading. On July 6, Voyager declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.To reassure the platform's millions of users, Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich tweeted that after the company goes through bankruptcy proceedings, members with crypto in their account would potentially be eligible for a grab bag of stuff, including a combination of some amount of their holdings, common shares in the reorganized Voyager, Voyager tokens, and whatever proceeds they could get from the now-defunct loan to 3AC.None of that is guaranteed. Voyager customers netted a small win in bankruptcy court on Thursday, after the court granted them access to $270 million in cash Voyager held with Metropolitan Commercial Bank. Users, however, are still out of luck when it comes to everything else.Bankman-Fried says he's here to help customers get back up and running and recapture what they can. Voyager attorneys, on the other hand, portray the FTX-Alameda bid as a fire sale.Whatever happens, this might be Bankman-Fried's last best shot of getting some value out of his hefty financial commitment. In a July press release, he tried spinning his offer as a benefit to Voyager customers who were suddenly wrapped up in an ""insolvent crypto business.""Bankman-Fried said in the statement that the deal would let Voyager clients ""obtain early liquidity and reclaim a portion of their assets without forcing them to speculate on bankruptcy outcomes and take one-sided risks.""WATCH: Why federal charges over an alleged Ponzi scheme may only be the tip of the iceberg"

Coinbase shares dropped in extended trading on Tuesday after the crypto exchange reported a loss of over $1 billion in the second quarter and missed analysts' estimates for revenue.Here's how the company did:Earnings: Loss of $4.98 per share, vs. loss of $2.65 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.Revenue: $808.3 million, vs. $832.2 million as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.Coinbase's revenue declined nearly 64% as investors exited the crypto market after last year's dramatic run. Retail transaction revenue came in at $616.2 million, down 66% and below the $667.1 million consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount.Coinbase reported a $1.1 billion net loss, compared with $1.59 billion in net income in the same quarter last year, according to a letter to shareholders. One factor was a $377 million noncash cryptocurrency-related impairment charge. Coinbase's own cryptocurrency assets at the end of June were worth $428 million, down from about $1 billion at the end of March. Over 40% of the cryptocurrency assets were in bitcoin.""Q2 was a test of durability for crypto companies and a complex quarter overall,"" the company said in the letter. ""Dramatic market movements shifted user behavior and trading volume, which impacted transaction revenue, but also highlighted the strength of our risk management program.""The company said it had 9 million monthly transacting users during the period, down from 9.2 million in the first quarter but more than the 8.7 million StreetAccount consensus.

Coinbase said it was extending its hiring freeze into the foreseeable future and cutting 18% of headcount. Assets on platform fell quarter over quarter to $96 billion from $256 billion, mostly because of pressure on cryptocurrency prices, Coinbase said.""While we did see net outflows in Q2, we observed that the majority of this behavior was institutional clients de-risking and selling crypto for fiat as opposed to withdrawing their crypto to another platform,"" Coinbase said in the shareholder letter. ""As a result, our market share of the total crypto market capitalization declined to 9.9% from 11.2% in Q1.""Bitcoin accounted for 31% of transaction revenue in the quarter, the highest level since the first quarter of 2021, while 22% of transaction revenue was associated with ethereum.Coinbase updated its outlook for the full year. It now expects 7 million to 9 million monthly transacting users, down from a range of 5 million to 15 million three months ago. Management said it expects average transaction revenue per user in the low $20 range, rather than pre-2021 levels.To reduce marketing spending, the company is doing less with paid media and incentives, while pursuing ways to attract nonpaid traffic. It also reduced its forecast for technology, development and general and administrative expenses to $4 billion to $4.25 billion from the $4.25 billion to $5.25 billion range a quarter ago. That includes optimizing infrastructure spending.""Of course, we don't control the macroeconomic factors or downturn,"" CEO Brian Armstrong said on a conference call with analysts.

We can focus on staying on the forefront of crypto technology to make sure that we're creating compelling use cases and making those available to our customers. We can focus on our expense management in down markets, and, frankly, we can ensure that we just don't get distracted or disillusioned by short-term thinking.""Armstrong added that he expects the company's current efforts to result in ""disproportionate share in the next up cycle.""Coinbase shares declined almost 11% in Tuesday's regular trading session.WATCH: Much of bitcoin's next rally depends on the Fed "

2022-08-10,"RenBridge has been used to launder at least $540 million in crime-related crypto cash since 2020, according to new research from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.Cross-chain bridges are used to send digital assets across blockchains, bypassing a centralized service that can trace transactions.""They're effectively ungoverned, and so very vulnerable to hacks, or to being used in crimes like money laundering,"" said David Carlisle, Elliptic's vice president of policy and regulatory affairs. A major way criminals in the crypto world launder money is by sending digital assets across blockchains, bypassing a centralized service that can trace and freeze transactions.They use so-called cross-chain bridges to make it happen, and the dollar amounts are getting large. One particular cross-chain bridge called RenBridge has been used to launder at least $540 million in crime-related crypto cash since 2020, according to new research from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. Included in that amount is $153 million in ransomware payments, meaning hackers are using RenBridge when they break into corporate networks and force companies to pay up to get their data back. Elliptic says RenBridge was ""an important facilitator"" for Russia-linked ransomware gangs.David Carlisle, Elliptic's vice president of policy and regulatory affairs, said cross-chain bridges are ""a bit of a blessing and a curse"" at the moment. Like so many popular crypto tools, they help expand the market by giving people more ways to pay and transact. Cross-chain bridges are notably vital to the development of the decentralized finance, or DeFi, space, which is crypto's alternative to the banking system.The flipside is, ""they're effectively ungoverned, and so very vulnerable to hacks, or to being used in crimes like money laundering,"" Carlisle told CNBC.  Carlisle said he expects regulators to start zeroing in on bridges in the next six to 12 months, as governments continue to crack down on the darkest corners of the crypto world.On Monday, the Treasury Department blacklisted crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, alleging the service was used to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since 2019. Carlisle said the action taken by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control shows that U.S. regulators are prepared to go after criminal behavior in crypto.""One major question is whether bridges will become subject to regulation, since they act a lot like crypto exchanges, which are already regulated,"" Carlisle said.Developers have built cross-chain bridges to let users send tokens from one chain to another. Transfers of digital assets between chains rely on Darknodes, or networks of thousands of pseudonymous validators. That's allowed them to become a prime tool for obfuscating crypto cash.RenBridge became a popular destination to do just that. Elliptic says it's been used to launder assets originating from theft, fraud, ransomware, and various other types of criminal activity.  Other crypto assets laundered across RenBridge were likely stolen by North Korea, Elliptic said. The service was also used by the Conti cybercrime group, which recently attacked the Costa Rican government and triggered a national state of emergency. Elliptic's research shows that Conti has laundered more than $53 million through RenBridge.""Cross-chain bridges are a loophole in the regulatory regime that has been painstakingly established by governments around the world, to combat crypto laundering,"" said Tom Robinson, Elliptic's chief scientist. RenBridge is a go-to option for those looking to clean stolen cash. More than $267 million in crypto assets taken from exchanges and DeFi services were laundered through RenBridge in the last two years, including $33.8 million from Japanese crypto exchange Liquid, according to Elliptic.The bridges are particularly vulnerable to attacks.Blockchain cybersecurity firm CertiK previously noted that when bridges hold hundreds of millions of dollars of assets in escrow and multiply their possible vectors of attack by operating across two or more blockchains, they become prime targets for hackers.Last week, a bridge known as Nomad lost almost $200 million in a devastating exploit resulting from a bug. Within hours, the thieves began using RenBridge to launder the money. Thus far, $2.4 million in crypto assets stolen from Nomad have been sent through RenBridge, according to Elliptic.""Ransomware gangs, fraudsters and even North Korean hackers are shifting from regulated crypto exchanges to a decentralized, unregulated alternative,"" Robinson said.RenBridge is an open protocol, so it doesn't operate with a CEO or any central figureheads.

2022-08-11,"The world's second-biggest cryptocurrency reached a price above $1,900 on Thursday, according to data from CoinMetrics.It comes after ethereum, ether's underlying network, successfully ran its final dry run for a key event called the ""merge.""Slated to take place in September, the merge is expected to make ethereum faster and more energy-efficient. Ether soared to a two-month high after developers successfully completed a final dress rehearsal for a pivotal upgrade expected to happen next month.The world's second-biggest cryptocurrency climbed as high as $1,927 on Thursday, marking its highest level since early June, according to data from CoinMetrics. The token was last trading at $1,901.69, up 4.4% on the day.On Wednesday, Ethereum ran its final dry run for the ""merge,"" a key event that is expected to make it faster and more energy-efficient. One of Ethereum's test networks, called Goerli, simulated a process identical to what the main network will execute in September. Testnets allow developers to experiment and make necessary adjustments before updates launch on the main blockchain.The merge will see ether's underlying blockchain transition from a proof-of-work system to a more efficient model called proof-of-stake. Proof-of-work consensus mechanisms depend on crypto miners to verify transactions. Proof-of-stake networks, on the other hand, require validators to hold a certain amount of tokens to participate, making them much less energy-intensive. The event, which has been delayed multiple times, is now expected to take place on Sept. 19.Once finalized, the upgrade is expected to speed up transactions on the ethereum network and make it more energy-efficient, with backers hopeful it will address criticisms over the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. That has led some investors to bet ether may eventually end up stealing bitcoin's thunder. Bitcoin has lost some ground to other tokens in recent years, with its market dominance slipping below 40% from almost 70% at the beginning of 2020. For IT specialist Kaj Burchardi, whether ethereum eventually unseats bitcoin as the crypto king is ""pretty much irrelevant"" since the two don't directly compete with one another.""The purpose of why you buy bitcoin, from a mindset perspective, and what you actually want to do with that is fundamentally different than when you use ethereum,"" said Burchardi, managing director of BCG Platinion, the IT-focused division of Boston Consulting Group.""Ethereum ... is not a use case. It's providing possibilities of implementing really good use cases like NFTs [nonfungible tokens] and banking products on a platform. Bitcoin is a use case.""Following the success of the merge test, ether led a broad rally among digital assets Thursday, with the combined value of all cryptocurrencies climbing over $70 billion in a day to $1.2 trillion. Bitcoin was up 6% at a price of $24,507, reaching an almost two-week high, while Binance's BNB token was 3% higher at $330.Still, investors have soured on cryptocurrencies more generally following the catastrophic implosion of the $60 billion stablecoin TerraUSD, which sent shockwaves through the crypto market and helped trigger the collapse of investment firms Celsius, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital.

2022-08-11,"Some influencers on social media platforms are making thousands of dollars for each promotional video they make for various cryptocurrency projects.State regulators have found instances in which influencers have promoted fraudulent enterprises. In some cases, influencers failed to disclose the projects they promoted were part of a paid sponsorship, potentially leading their viewers to make risky investments. Ben Armstrong says his crisis of conscience came in January of this year, when he realized he had to stop a business practice he — and a lot of other people in his line of work — had been engaged in for years. Armstrong is one of the most-watched crypto influencers on YouTube. His channel, BitBoy Crypto, has amassed more than 1.5 million subscribers. For years, Armstrong said he accepted payments from crypto companies to tout their new products for his vast audience of subscribers. That's a practice he says he now regrets because it led to some painful losses for his own viewers.In the fall of 2020, Armstrong announced his partnership with a cryptocurrency called DistX, calling it his most trusted coin. He said the whole idea of DistX was to stop scams in crypto — but Armstrong said in the end, the project itself ended up being a scam. The project team rug pulled, meaning they worked to increase the market cap then disappeared — leaving investors holding the bag. The coin is now down 99%, valued at less than a penny. While he was accepting paid promotions, Armstrong said he previously made more than $30,000 for a single endorsement, which included his promotional video for DistX, and could easily make more than $100,000 per month in promotions alone.Armstrong now says he feels responsible for the losses suffered by his followers. ""I mean, of course, I do,"" he said. ""I hate it when we talk about stuff that didn't do well.""While Armstrong says he stopped accepting paid promotions in January, other influencers still swarm this lucrative market. CNBC found that some of these online personalities get paid thousands to endorse dubious projects. This spring, an anonymous blockchain sleuth posted a list on Twitter naming 44 YouTube crypto personalities and their prices for paid promotions. Some of these influencers were paid as much as $65,000 for a single promotional video, according to that list. Armstrong says he used the money he made from the promotion of DistX to refund his followers after the coin crashed, adding that he felt particularly guilty for how heavily advertised it was on his channel. However, he says that is the only project in which he intervened in that way after investors lost money taking his advice.While Armstrong does disclose that he is not a trained financial professional, many of the ventures he's promoted have plummeted. After other cryptocurrency ventures like Ethereum Yield, Cypherium and MYX Network dropped in value, he deleted the promotional videos for them off his channel.  CNBC reached out to these influencers on the list to verify their fees: Some said the prices were inflated, and those willing to share their pricing said they made a minimum of $1,000 for each promotional video. Unlike Armstrong, who says he disclosed all of his paid promotional videos, some influencers don't share that they're getting handsomely paid to plug projects. According to Armstrong, many of the companies that contacted him while he was collecting fees for endorsements didn't want him to tell his viewers the content was sponsored.Armstrong said that five years ago many influencers would not disclose that they were paid to plug projects, but most influencers today are upfront about promotions with their viewers.But state regulators warn that there are still influencers who lack transparency. Joe Rotunda, the director of the enforcement division of the Texas State Securities Board, said he's seen paid promotions that are not only undisclosed but are pushing fraudulent ventures. Rotunda and a team of regulators recently filed enforcement actions against two casinos in the metaverse, the new digital frontier where users can attend virtual concerts, purchase digital assets or even gamble at a casino. The actions cited Flamingo Casino Club and Sand Vegas Casino Club, accusing them of trying to defraud retail investors by selling unregistered securities.Neither casino responded to requests for comment.""We have to identify the frauds that are out there, especially the frauds tied to the metaverse,"" Rotunda said.Rotunda said his team found the fraudulent metaverse operations through promotions from crypto influencers on YouTube. He referenced two popular influencers who promoted Flamingo Casino Club in videos reaching about 80,000 viewers.The cease-and-desist order against Flamingo Casino Club said one of the influencers promoting the casino was ""recruiting promoters to engage and pay him to advertise their products through his YouTube channel."" He also found messages on a popular chat platform that said one of these influencers ""brought in a lot [of investors] from their videos.""CNBC reached out to the two influencers mentioned in the enforcement action as promoting the metaverse casinos accused of defrauding investors about whether they have taken undisclosed payments for promotion.The influencer known as FLOZIN said he wasn't paid for his endorsement, but it appears he deleted his promotional video after CNBC started asking questions. The Dream Green Show, the second influencer, did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.Questionable promotions aren't just happening through crypto influencers on YouTube. The House Ethics Committee announced in May that it was investigating potentially improper cryptocurrency promotions by Rep. Madison Cawthorn, a Republican from North Carolina.Disclosures released after the committee's announcement reveal Cawthorn bought between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of ""Let's Go Brandon"" cryptocurrency. He was seen in a photo with the coin's co-founders on Instagram the next week, commenting ""Tomorrow we go to the moon!"" News broke the next day of a sponsorship deal with a NASCAR driver, causing the price of the coin to jump 75%.Cawthorn, who lost his primary election in May, said he sold between $100,000 and $250,000 of the coin the day after the rally. Within the next few weeks, NASCAR rejected the deal and the value of the coin collapsed.Taylor Monahan, product lead at the digital currency wallet called MetaMask, said she is ""viciously opposed"" to all partnerships with crypto influencers. ""I would urge anyone, even if they consider themselves legitimate, to not form these sort of faux partnerships,"" Monahan said.Monahan said she's hesitant to support banning online promotions because of the negative effects she's seen from limiting and regulating cryptocurrencies. Instead, she says the crypto community could band together to call out partnerships and make them less common.Armstrong said the decision to stop paid promotions has taken a burden off him because he can post freely. But he said he does understand why others continue to create sponsored videos.""Obviously, we did it for a long time, because it's a good way to build your business,"" Armstrong said. ""But you just have to do it in an honest way.""Rotunda warned that the more interest grows for decentralized currencies and the metaverse, the more scams will pop up. Regulators, he said, need to focus on digital asset transactions because there's more crime yet to be detected.""What we're seeing is the tip of the iceberg,"" Rotunda said.Still, the paid promotions business isn't what it was in 2021, with the crypto market down 49% year to date. Armstrong said that in a bear market less legitimate crypto influencers could face more scrutiny and ghost their subscribers.— Érica Carnevalli and Margaret Fleming contributed to this article.Email tips to investigations@cnbc.com"

Bitcoin fundamentals are ""quite good"" in the long term due to factors which will ""create a demand shock"" for the cryptocurrency, Skybridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci said Monday.""Everybody is a long-term investor until they have short term losses,"" Scaramucci told CNBC on ""Capital Connection.""Investors may be seeing some losses on bitcoin ""but I think long term, the fundamentals are quite good,"" he added.Bitcoin is still more than 60% below its all-time high of almost $69,000 in November.In June, bitcoin plunged to $17,958, its lowest level since December 2020, according to Coin Metrics data. Bitcoin was last trading at $24,047.28 , down 2.4% in the last 24 hours at 4:57am ET on Monday, CoinDesk data showed.Scaramucci said he's optimistic that ""two major things have happened on the institutional side"" that will likely generate demand for bitcoin.""Fidelity is allowing for their 401k products to offer bitcoin,"" he stated as the first reason, referring to financial services company Fidelity Investments allowing companies to offer employees the option to invest up to 20% of their retirement and savings plan in bitcoin. Scaramucci cited Blackrock's offering of a private trust for clients to invest in bitcoin as another reason that will generate tailwinds for the cryptocurrency.""Blackrock said in addition to teaming up with Coinbase on their Aladdin risk management program… that they're going to offer a private trust that will give their clients an opportunity to invest directly in bitcoin.""The investment management firm, which has about $8.5 trillion in assets under management, recently announced a partnership with Coinbase that allows its institutional clients to buy crypto, starting with bitcoin. Scaramucci said ethereum's upcoming so-called ""merge"" is a reason why the decentralized blockchain-based network went up in value.""Ethereum is about to merge and reduce their gas fees and transactions fees. And that's one of the reasons why ethereum is up about 70 plus percent over the last five and a half weeks.""Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, ran a final dress rehearsal last week ahead of a long-awaited upgrade that's been billed as one of the most important events in crypto's history.Ether, which is used to power the ethereum blockchain network, soared to a two-month high after the final dry run for the merge. The token was last trading at $1,905.40, down 4.7% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk.

2022-08-15,"Bitcoin briefly topped $25,000 to hit its highest level in June before falling sharply as the cryptocurrency struggles to make any significant move higher.Bitcoin's rise can be attributed to a rally in alternative coins, or altcoins. Ether was up 56% in the last month, far outpacing the gains made by bitcoin as investors anticipate an ethereum upgrade.The crypto market has also been lifted by a rally in U.S. stocks on signs that inflation pressures could be easing. Bitcoin briefly topped $25,000 to hit its highest level in June before falling sharply as the cryptocurrency struggles to make any significant move higher.The world's largest digital coin popped above $25,000 late on Sunday for the first time since mid-June, according to CoinDesk data. It was flat on Monday at $24,120.61.Cryptocurrencies moved higher in the last month or so following a rise in U.S. stocks. Digital currencies like bitcoin have been relatively correlated to the movement in stock markets, in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which was itself up around 12% in the last month. Investors have been getting more bullish after economic data showed inflation pressures could be easing a bit.Bitcoin was up around 15% in the same period but it is still down around 48% year-to-date. It has been a rough few months for the crypto market, with trillions wiped off its value and bankruptcies and liquidity issues plaguing a number of players.The cryptocurrency has been trading in a range since late June of around $20,000 to $24,000. While it has shown attempts to push higher, it has struggled to create a significant breakout. But there are now signs of a small rally.""BTC continues to show signs of bullishness mainly due to higher highs and lows being formed,"" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC.Bitcoin's rise can also be attributed to a rally in alternative coins, or altcoins. Ether was up 56% in the last month, far outpacing the gains made by bitcoin.That's because investors are excited about a major long-awaited upgrade to the Ethereum network that could improve the efficiency of transactions. Ether is the native cryptocurrency that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.The upgrade, known as the ""merge,"" ran its final dress rehearsal last week.That rally in ether is also feeding through to bitcoin.""We're seeing BTC catch up with ETH, given the excitement over the merge, potentially scheduled for 15th September,"" Ayyar said."
2022-08-15,"Many of Voyager Digital's 3.5 million customers are reaching out directly to the New York bankruptcy court judge overseeing the case.In a bankruptcy hearing and in letters officially submitted to the court, Voyager users pleaded for their money back.Starting Thursday, some Voyager users were supposed to have access to $270 million in cash Voyager held with Metropolitan Commercial Bank. During a five-hour Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearing earlier this month for crypto firm Voyager Digital, a customer named Magnolia was the first user to step forward and speak about her experience.Magnolia, who only disclosed her first name, said she had over $1 million trapped on the platform, including $350,000 that was earmarked to pay for college for her children. She said it had taken her 24 years to save, and she had sacrificed spending time with her kids in order to build that nest egg.""I do feel like we're paying the ultimate price for them being fiscally irresponsible,"" Magnolia said. ""They had our trust, they had our money, and they did not run this company properly.""Magnolia wanted to know why Voyager borrowed money instead of cutting costs when it knew things were going south. She also asked whether CEO Stephen Ehrlich was still getting paid and receiving a bonus.Magnolia is one of Voyager's 3.5 million customers, a group that's desperate for answers more than a month after the company suspended all trading and, soon after, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Voyager, once a popular lending platform, drew in retail investors by offering them up to double-digit annual returns in exchange for parking their tokens with Voyager.As the crypto market boomed last year, Voyager inked sports sponsorships with the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and owner Mark Cuban, Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski, NASCAR driver Landon Cassill and the National Women's Soccer League.While those names helped hype the service, they didn't change the risk that customers faced when they joined the platform. Their funds were unsecured.A crash in crypto prices in 2022, largely due to Federal Reserve rate hikes and investor rotation out of the riskiest assets, created a liquidity crisis for hedge funds and crypto sites with excess exposure to digital assets. Many of those firms defaulted on loans, creating a cascading effect that infected the broader industry and lenders like Voyager.In addition to the hearing in early August in the Southern District of New York, Voyager customers also had an opportunity to voice their displeasure in a livestream chat accompanying a 52-minute virtual town hall last week. There they could make their pleas to the ""Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors,"" a group formed by the bankruptcy court of SDNY to resolve asset distribution.The committee consists of lawyers from McDermott Will & Emery as well as restructuring advisors from FTI Consulting and a select group of creditors. They say the focus is the ""prompt return of USD and crypto to creditors.""Members of the committee gave an overview of the bankruptcy proceedings so far, an estimated timeline to reimbursement and a how-to on the claim submission process. One committee member noted, however, that the guidance they were providing was ""not legal advice"" and that it was ""strongly recommended"" that individual creditors consider retaining counsel to assist with this process.As of the time of publication, the recording of the town hall on YouTube had more than 4,000 views. Voyager customers were given the chance to submit questions in advance of the event last week. Many also chimed in over the real-time chat on YouTube.​""I was a fool not taking my crypto when I first heard about the loan,"" wrote Cindy Wheeler. ""Thought Voyager was a safe exchange.""Another participant, Ari Gurewitz, referenced Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a crypto hedge fund that filed for bankruptcy while owing over $650 million to Voyager.""Interesting that Voyager declares bankruptcy before knowing what the full impact of the 3AC bankruptcy has on them,"" Gurewitz wrote. ""Makes one wonder if this is a bit of a ploy to just restructure and remove a lot of their losses — at their customers expense!""Voyager said it has about 100,000 creditors. They will have to vote on the plan Voyager establishes in bankruptcy court, but many say they don't have much of a voice in the process. That's why several customers are begging U.S. bankruptcy court judge Michael Wiles for help. At the bankruptcy hearing, Magnolia said she felt that Voyager had defrauded its customers. In very short order, it all went from boom to bust.""This is a company that's talking about how great they're doing,"" she said. ""They have Mark Cuban, Rob Gronkowski. They have the Dallas Mavericks Arena with the 'Buy Voyager' all over it. They're spending big money on their marketing, on their people, on their locations. Where was the heads up on this?""Another customer, who didn't share his name but said he was 32, said at the hearing he had ""well over seven figures"" stranded on the app.""I just want to position myself as an owner and a depositor of my cryptocurrency,"" he said. ""I'm witnessing 10 years of my life being frozen on a platform that I trusted.""The issue of ownership is proving to be particularly vexing for this customer and others. In crypto, one of the mantras is — ""not your keys, not your coins"" — meaning that rightful ownership of tokens comes through the custody of the corresponding private keys. Customers can't simply demand their money back and expect to receive it, even though they viewed the funds as deposits, not investments.""I've always identified myself as an owner and a rightful depositor of the cryptocurrency that was provided on their platform,"" the customer said. ""I just want to get more of a handle on why I'm being labeled a creditor, or unsecured creditor, instead of the owner of my cryptocurrency.""Clients are right to be confused.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which protects bank deposits, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued a joint letter in late July to Voyager, alleging the company made false and misleading statements about its deposit insurance status.At the bankruptcy hearing, a customer named Ginger Little said that when she put money on the platform, she had to convert it from U.S. dollars to the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC in order to earn the attractive annual percentage yield that drew her to the app.""We were never told that wasn't the same as cash,"" Little said. ""We were told that it had to be listed that way in order to get interest for the money that we put in there as an investment.""Magnolia echoed that sentiment, saying she thought Voyager had touted its USDC as being ""FDIC insured.""Christine Okike, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, which is representing Voyager, said during the bankruptcy hearing that the current effort is focused on cash retrieval, not USDC.""USDC is a type of cryptocurrency, a type of coin,"" Okike said. ""And so that is not being discussed or adjudicated on in the context of the release of cash that's being requested by the debtors.""A Voyager spokesperson declined to comment. Other customers have submitted letters directly addressed to the judge.Jacob Redburn said he had deposited 100 ether, or about $198,800 at today's price and $480,000 at the market peak, on to Voyager's digital trading platform.""I have spent years saving, investing, and trading crypto assets to build what was a life-changing amount of money that I would one day sell to provide college and other needs for my family,"" Redburn wrote on a yellow legal pad.Redburn wrote that the CEO ""straight lied to us,"" when he said a week before the filing that the company had no issues.""This will ruin my future, my daughter's future, and cost the government hundreds of thousands in capital gains I would pay when I do plan to sell,"" he wrote. ""I beg that we are to receive our crypto that we're owed, not worthless stock or Voyager tokens worth nothing.""Christine Marcy, a newly retired senior citizen living in Florida, said Voyager's ""willful and intentional actions (malfeasance) are causing emotional and economic hardship for an entire community of customers."" She said she was denied in her effort to remove some assets just before the withdrawal freeze.""I have an abruptly frozen account and my assets are now held hostage,"" Marcy wrote. ""I made investments with Voyager, a publicly traded company, with the expectation there would be some sense of accountability and responsibility to customers.""Donald A., who currently has around $31,000 frozen on the Voyager exchange, said that ""losing this money with no end in sight has been unbearable"" for his family. He said the company was never transparent with customers about the kind of risk it was taking, such as lending large sums to 3AC.""I wake up most nights and just walk up and down the stairs contemplating on my own mistakes and wondering if this will ever end,"" he wrote. ""My anxiety has been a struggle."" The unsecured creditors committee told customers in the town hall that Voyager will soon send proof-of-claim forms to all creditors with what Voyager believes they are owed in crypto, cash or both.Voyager currently has approximately $1.3 billion in crypto assets on the platform, $104 million in cash, and a claim against the now defunct 3AC for around $650 million. Creditor claims total $1.8 billion so far. Updated figures are expected this week when Voyager files its schedules.The committee said it was able to negotiate a ""very aggressive"" plan timeline, which targets the end of October, though the timing is subject to change. On that schedule, distributions to creditors would occur in November at the earliest.The committee said it's taking the ""unprecedented"" step of advocating for an interim distribution to provide creditors with some relief during the bankruptcy process.Last Thursday was the first day customers were supposed to be able to retrieve some of their money back from the platform, but conditions for eligibility were very strict.Judge Wiles granted qualifying Voyager users access to $270 million in cash Voyager held with Metropolitan Commercial Bank. Customers who had U.S. dollars in their account at the bank apparently now are allowed to withdraw up to $100,000 in a 24-hour period through the Voyager app.Other Voyager users with funds held in crypto still can't touch their money.""We recognize that many of you were led to believe that the crypto you held on the Voyager platform was your property,"" one committee member said during the town hall. ""Unfortunately, for all of us, that's not the legal test in bankruptcy for determining whether the crypto is your property or property of the bankruptcy estate.""— CNBC's Rohan Goswami contributed to this report.WATCH: Why federal charges over an alleged Ponzi scheme may only be the tip of the iceberg"
2022-08-17,"Michael Moro, who joined Genesis in 2015 and took over as CEO the following year, is leaving the company.Genesis is also slashing 20% of its workforce, or more than 50 jobs.The company lost money that it loaned to hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which filed for bankruptcy. Digital asset brokerage Genesis said on Wednesday that CEO Michael Moro is stepping down and the company is slashing 20% of its workforce, the latest casualties as the cryptocurrency market unwinds.Derar Islim, Genesis' operating chief, will take over as interim CEO while the company searches for a permanent replacement, the company said in a statement.Genesis is a unit of Digital Currency Group, the crypto investor and conglomerate founded by Barry Silbert. Genesis was early in the market, launching the first over-the-counter crypto trading desk in 2013, and then expanding to become a major lender.During the 2021 crypto boom, Genesis boosted its book dramatically. Loan originations surged more than sevenfold to $131 billion, and the company increased headcount by 22% to 170 employees. By mid-2022, that number had swelled to 260. A cut of 20% equates to the loss of about 52 jobs. The rapid turn in the crypto market this year, which sent bitcoin and ethereum tumbling, wiped out firms whose businesses were tied directly to prices of digital assets. Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, filed for bankruptcy as did brokerage Voyager Digital and crypto lender Celsius Network.While Genesis has weathered the storm better than other players in the market, the firm suffered significant losses due its exposure to 3AC. In July, Genesis filed a $1.2 billion claim against 3AC because of breached loans.""Genesis was not immune to the market drop and the damage to overall sentiment,"" the company said in a report on second-quarter market observations. ""As we've stated publicly, Genesis had loan exposure to Three Arrows Capital. Our parent company DCG assumed the liability related to losses on these loans, leaving our balance sheet healthy so Genesis could continue to be a source of strength for our clients.""Moro, who joined Genesis in 2015 and took over as CEO the following year, will stay on during the leadership transition, Genesis said. The company said it also recently hired new executives as chief risk officer, chief compliance officer and chief technology officer.WATCH: Sam-Bankman-Fried's portfolio, Alameda, losses on Voyager"
2022-08-17,"The GDP dipped in July, sparking recession fears and scaring many Americans about their financial futures. That fear may even lead some to avoid investing altogether, or to panic and sell current stocks.But it shouldn't.For first-time investors who may be afraid of the current market, the ""Wolfette of Wall Street"" Lauren Simmons shares some advice to try: Ignore how you feel.  ""Warren Buffett says never invest with emotions,"" the 28-year-old tells CNBC Make It. ""So if you're investing out of fear or really excited and you're chasing something: No.""Buffett, investing legend and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, doesn't allow current events or the news to affect his investment decision making, he said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in 2018. No matter what happens, ""we will buy the same stocks today that we were buying last week,"" he said.That's because changing your investments based on emotion goes against investing for the long-term. Instead, once you find a company worth investing in, stick with it. ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes,"" Buffett said in his 1996 shareholders letter.Simmons agrees. ""Long-term investing always perseveres,"" she says. ""We do not need to be watching the stock market on a day-to-day basis. It's like watching paint dry, and it will give you a heart attack.""It's also important to learn as much as you can before investing, says Simmons, who became the youngest full-time woman trader on Wall Street at 22 and is on track to earn $1 million this year. ""You're not going to miss some opportunity if you don't invest today,"" she says. ""Really take the time to invest."" Simmons herself took two years to figure out what kind of investor she wanted to be. Simmons emphasizes the importance of understanding your risk tolerance as well. If you have a high risk tolerance, you may be OK investing in speculative assets like crypto, Simmons explains, while a more conservative investor may stick to putting money in savings accounts, despite the low interest rates. Most investors will fall somewhere in between, investing in a mix of bonds and equities, based on their individual goals.Of course, if you are not in a good financial situation to invest, wait. If you don't have savings or have continuous debt, ""please do not invest your money,"" Simmons says. ""Just take [your] time.

A smooth and ""complete decentralization"" of Web3 is not yet a reality, said Randi Zuckerberg, referring to a system in which users rather than companies have ownership of services and data.The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday.The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology — an ""ideal utopia,"" said Zuckerberg.""But … that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos."" The founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, ""You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.""Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta — formerly known as Facebook — explained that various metaverses are now acting as ""their own walled garden,"" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms.The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars. ""Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great — we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,"" she said.""In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,"" Zuckerberg added. However, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or ""share that ownership.""""That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.""She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 — the internet that we know today — to lend a ""protective layer."" The need for such experts is all the more important because it has been ""too easy"" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg.""There needs to be more protections for consumers … I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.""Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added.""It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly."" The metaverse may still be in its infancy, but Zuckerberg pointed out that sectors like real estate will be ""extremely valuable.""""Wherever there's scarcity … there's value. I think the big question will just be, is there scarcity in the metaverse and if there is, there will be value in real estate there,"" she added.According to data from MetaMetrics Solutions, real estate sales in the metaverse surpassed $500 million in 2021 and could double in 2022.Zuckerberg said that education and training will be another ""huge area"" for opportunities and revenue.""Especially in this new age where workers are remote, it is very difficult to upskill remote workers … I think training in the metaverse, education in an interactive way, is going to become crucial for every business that has a remote work,"" she added.""We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see."""

As a result, Fed Chairman Jay Powell's remarks next week at the annual central bank confab in Jackson Hole, Wyoming take on critical importance for the stock market's autumn performance.Looking ahead, if Powell tries ""to re-tighten financial conditions...or acknowledges the resilience of large chunks of the U.S. economy, the one driver of the rally we are witnessing – multiple expansion driven by lower yields – could prove precarious, as we move into a phase in which better news for the economy could be bad news for the market,"" Credit Suisse said.— Scott Schnipper  Fri, Aug 19 202210:25 AM EDT Cruise operators' shares dipped in morning trading on Friday, dragging down the S&P 500.

That's a spike of nearly 60% compared to a year ago.""Despite the misconception that cryptocurrency is anonymous, it remains easier to run away with coins or tokens,"" says Max Krupyshev, co-founder and leader of crypto payment ecosystem CoinsPaid. ""I don't think that crypto hackers are stronger than the 'usual' kinds, it's just that crypto platforms are new and hold valuable assets.""Bad actors are increasingly targeting decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which are uniquely vulnerable to hacking, according to the report. DeFi programs are the underlying blockchain technology that enable financial transactions to occur outside of traditional banks. These programs primarily utilize the Ethereum blockchain.DeFi programs are public and use open-source code, which can be helpful because it typically allows for security issues to be discovered and fixed quickly.However, since open-source code is available for anyone to review, cybercriminals are able to extensively study the code and find vulnerabilities that can be exploited and used to steal crypto funds, according to the report.And hackers aren't likely to stop any time soon. They have already stolen $190 million from crypto startup Nomad and $5 million from several Solana digital wallets during the first week of August, Chainalysis reports.""The only way to stop them is for the industry to shore up security and educate consumers on how to find safe projects to invest in,"" the report advises.There are plenty of virtual wallets that can safely store your crypto and secure it against online attacks, too, says Krupyshev. However, it's important to do thorough research first to determine which type of wallet makes sense for you.It's also crucial to do your own research before investing in anything in order to avoid potential scams.There are ""fake opportunities and Ponzi [schemes] shining with their neon lights all over the place,""  Krupyshev warns. ""No secure wallet can save a young investor from them.""Additionally, law enforcement must continue to develop its ability to seize stolen cryptocurrency so that hacks are no longer attractive to cybercriminals, Chainalysis reports.Although many investors are drawn to the unregulated nature of cryptocurrency, the lack of a central regulating authority means investors typically don't have the same protections offered by traditional financial institutions like banks.And remember, crypto assets can be highly volatile and subject to wild price valuations.

The small, money-losing New Jersey deli that was once the sole asset of a publicly traded company with a bizarre market capitalization of $100 million has been sold and closed, according to a regulatory filing.Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, had been ""temporarily closed"" on June 19 while its management sought a new buyer, Makamer Holdings said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.On July 1, Makamer sold the deli's remaining inventory for $700. And then on Aug. 9, the company ""disposed of its subsidiary Your Hometown Deli, LLC for a price of $15,000, consisting of $5,000 to be paid in cash and a $10,000 note receivable,"" the filing said.Makamer, a bioplastics startup, merged with the deli's owner, Hometown International, earlier this year.""After carefully evaluating its prospects, the Company's new management has determined to sell Your Hometown Deli and its assets and focus on the business operations of Makamer as the Company's business going forward,"" the regulatory filing said.""The delicatessen ceased its operation following the merger,"" it said.The phone number of the deli, which had just $25,004 in sales 2021, was out of service Monday when CNBC called it.Online, the restaurant is listed as ""permanently closed.""Hometown International was previously headed by Paul Morina, a Paulsboro high school principal and wrestling coach in Paulsboro.The company drew widespread public attention in April 2021 when the hedge fund manager David Einhorn in a client letter noted the disparity between the deli's decidedly modest sales and Hometown's sky-high stock market valuation.""The pastrami must be amazing,"" Einhorn cracked in that letter.Makamer Holdings said it is now focused on making biodegradable resins to replace existing petroleum-based plastics.For the three months ended June 30, the company reported a net loss of $9 million, which it attributed to the closing of the deli and the transition to bioplastics.The last publicly known trade of Makamer stock was a sale of 300 shares for $9 per share on July 22.

2022-08-23,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC the company is taking a close look at where it can cut costs as industry and economic challenges continue to surface.Armstrong said the current downturn is reminiscent of what the company has dealt with in the past.The CEO said he expects to get clarity regarding SEC regulations after the midterm elections. As crypto exchange Coinbase faces industry challenges and economic headwinds, the company is taking a close look at where it can cut costs, CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC's Kate Rooney.Coinbase shares have lost more than 70% of their value this year as the company has grappled with a ""crypto winter"" tied to the plummeting of bitcoin and ethereum. Armstrong said the downturn is not unusual, as Coinbase has been through four down cycles in the 10 years since he started the company.Coinbase is facing inflationary pressures and a potential recession, but Armstrong said the macro environment is reminiscent of what the company has dealt with in the past.""We have this saying internally, I like to repeat a lot, which is you know, it's never as good as it seems, it's never as bad as it seems,"" he said. ""I think one of the reasons Coinbase has been so successful in the last 10 years is we just we try not to get focused on short-term ups and downs."" Coinbase cut 18% of its workforce in June, and Armstrong previously attributed the layoffs to a possible recession and a need to manage the company's burn rate and increase efficiency.Armstrong said the layoffs were meant to be a one-time event, but that ""anything could happen.""""I can't tell you what the world's going to be like a year from now,"" he said. Armstrong said Coinbase is looking closely at reducing costs related to marketing, external vendors and Amazon Web Services.He added that the company is looking to convert as many fixed costs into variable costs as possible. That could mean Coinbase Super Bowl ads are a thing of the past, though Armstrong said there will still be a ""variety of Coinbase ads out there.""The bear case for Coinbase has been around potential pressure on trading fees, which accounted for more than 80% of revenue in the second quarter. Noted short seller Jim Chanos is among those betting against Coinbase, claiming that it over earns on fees and as ""competition increases amongst the exchanges, you're going to see fee compression.""Armstrong said fees will eventually erode as they have in the stock brokerage industry. But Coinbase is not yet seeing price sensitivity.""I do think there's going to be margin compression, eventually it has to happen at some point because everything that we're building, you know, others, eventually you're going to build it and it'll become a little bit more commoditized,"" Armstrong said. ""I'd like to get to a place where more than 50% of our revenue is subscription and services.""That part of the business, subscription and services, has grown to roughly 18% of revenue from 4% a year earlier. It includes interest income, Coinbase's premium membership, blockchain rewards and fees for storing crypto on the platform on behalf of customers. Coinbase has also dealt with SEC scrutiny in recent months. The agency charged an ex-Coinbase product manager with fraud and launched a probe into whether the platform is illegitimately allowing users to trade digital assets that haven't been registered as securities.Determining how to classify cryptocurrency tokens is controversial, and Armstrong said he expects the company will receive some regulatory clarity after the midterm elections. If cryptocurrencies are considered commodities like other kinds of currency, they would be governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But many crypto projects are funded by the sale of speculative tokens.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that ""many of these underlying tokens have the attributes of securities"" and need to be regulated as such to protect investors.Armstrong said he's happy to be working with the SEC.""You know, we've been in actually engaging with regulators and I actually think it's a good thing,"" Armstrong said. ""And our overall goal is really to help drive regulatory clarity on a global scale."" Though Coinbase was started in San Francisco, it has no official headquarters and none of its employees are required to work in an office.Armstrong said he thinks the remote-first structure has been positive for the company's recruiting but that it has eroded some of the learning and development, creativity and trust. As a result, he said the company is trying to get employees together with some of their teammates in person at least once a quarter.Coinbase's mission statement says the company strives to be a ""refuge from division"" and does not ""engage in social or political activism."" Armstrong gained a lot of attention from CEOs in Silicon Valley and beyond for a blog post he wrote in 2020, declaring that political debates about candidates are off limits.Armstrong said he was ""shocked"" by the types of leaders who were reaching out to talk to him about it, but that he thinks the company has become almost too well known for its mission statement.""I kind of want to just turn the page on it,"" Armstrong said. ""I'd rather be better known for our products and all the cool innovation that we're doing, but, you know, in a way it was good that other companies found something interesting in it.""""I think it's net positive,"" he said. ""It's given us access to a wealth of talent in small towns in various countries.""WATCH: Models show risks to crypto assets falling substantially, says IDX's Ben McMillan"
2022-08-23,"Two PACs backing Liz Cheney hired i360, a data and technology company financed by billionaire Charles Koch, according to Federal Election Commission filings.People close to Donald Trump told CNBC that the former president and his allies could try to get people to stop working with Cheney.  Republican Rep. Liz Cheney has amassed a group of political consultants with ties to former President Donald Trump and the expansive Koch network as she mulls a run for the White House after losing in the GOP primary for her Wyoming House seat.Cheney's role as vice chair of the committee investigating Trump's actions in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has cost the third-highest ranking Republican in the U.S. House her standing in the GOP and her seat in Congress. She lost the Republican nomination in a landslide race last week to one of Trump's picks, Wyoming lawyer Harriet Hageman.Cheney's now considering running against Trump for president in 2024, she told NBC News, and has quietly put together a team of top GOP advisors to help her ensure he doesn't ever get back in the White House. ""I believe that Donald Trump continues to pose a very grave threat and risk to our republic. And I think that defeating him is going to require a broad and united front of Republicans, Democrats and independents, and that's what I intend to be a part of,"" she said in an exclusive interview with Savannah Guthrie on NBC's ""TODAY"" show last week.Immediately after her loss, she launched a leadership political action committee titled The Great Task which will allow her to keep her political aspirations alive while taking on the former president. Trump, whose home and private club Mar-a-Lago in Florida was raided by the FBI just days before the primary, has not ruled out running for president again in two years.Cheney is using some of Trump's own consultants and allies, including those from the powerful Koch network, to try to keep the former president from winning a second term in the White House. Some of them appear to have used limited liability companies that shroud their identity from the public.""These people are going to be persona non grata after the Cheney loss,"" a senior GOP strategist close to Trump said when asked if the president and his associates will work with the former Cheney advisors again. Jeff Miller, a longtime lobbyist and ally of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has told vendors not to work with Cheney's team, according to The New York Times.Miller and a spokesman for Trump did not return a request for comment. A spokesman for Cheney did not return a request for comment.Billionaire and conservative political backer Charles Koch is helping Cheney through i360, a data and technology company owned by his conglomerate, Koch Industries, according to financial database PitchBook and Federal Election Commission filings.The filing shows two PACs, Conservatives for a Strong America and Wyomingites Defending Freedom and Democracy, paid i360 to help deploy pro-Cheney ads through text messages. Axios reported that the leader of Wyomingites Defending Freedom and Democracy is former Trump White House aide Julia Griswold Dailer, who didn't return a request for comment.A nonprofit partially funded by Charles Koch, Americans for Prosperity, paid $11 million to i360 for data services, according to the nonprofit's 2020 tax disclosure.While Koch didn't back Trump during either his 2016 or 2020 campaigns, his political network worked with the Trump administration to support some of the former president's key initiatives, including cutting regulations for businesses and extensive tax cuts.Americans for Prosperity recently ran an ad campaign targeting Democratic lawmakers, including moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., to oppose the more than $400 billion Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law this month.FEC records show that i360 also has worked this election cycle with Dr. Mehmet Oz, who Trump endorsed for Pennsylvania's open Senate seat, as well as Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., who voted to impeach the former president and lost in his recent primary.Representatives for the pro-Cheney PACs, Koch Industries, i360 and Americans for Prosperity did not return requests for comment.After publication of this story, Americans for Prosperity spokesman Bill Riggs took issue with the headline of this article and noted that the group did not work the Wyoming House race between Cheney and Hageman.""This is clickbait. The headline doesn't match the facts in the piece. AFP and AFP Action have endorsed in over 300 races this year – the Wyoming House race was not one of them. The midterms are less than three months away. That is our sole focus, not a Presidential race more than two years off,"" Riggs said in a Tuesday email.A spokesperson for Koch Industries told CNBC in an email after publication of this story that i360 has over a thousand clients and that anyone using their product doesn't connotate an endorsement or support. ""The reality is that i360 has over a thousand clients with the majority being B2B [business to business], along with countless campaigns and political organizations and this includes a number of candidates supported by former President Trump as well as those who he has opposed. Utilizing i360s cutting-edge data technology doesn't connotate an endorsement or even singular support,"" the spokesperson said. Trump and the Koch family have not always been close, even after the former president adopted long-sought tax cuts and the nomination of numerous conservative-leaning Supreme Court Justices. Trump ripped the Kochs in 2018, saying in a tweet that they're a ""total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade."" The Koch network didn't help Trump in what would be his failed 2020 bid for reelection versus Biden.People close to Trump told CNBC that the former president and those aligned with him could move to halt future work with those who were employed by Cheney's team.FEC filings show that one of the Cheney campaign's top vendors in the 2022 election cycle was a company called Red Right Media. That company was paid more than $1 million for advertising and media services by Cheney's campaign during her 2022 primary run, including more than $300,000 in July, according to FEC disclosures.Though it doesn't appear to have a public website, Virginia business records say that Red Right Media is a an alternative name for a company called X/Roads Communications. According to state business records, X/Roads Communications is run by Mike Dubke, a veteran Republican strategist who once worked in Trump's White House as communications director. Dubke was a managing partner of X/Roads Communications before taking on the role with Trump in 2017, according to financial disclosures filed while leading the White House communications team.Dubke resigned from the White House communications post in 2017 after less than 100 days on the job. Since then, Red Right Media has been getting paid millions of dollars by Republican groups for consulting work, according to data from the nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets. Records show that a super PAC called DefendArizona paid more than $4 million for Red Right Media's services.The super PAC supported Martha McSally when she ran a failed campaign against Sinema during the 2018 election. DefendArizona was funded in part by Citadel CEO Ken Griffin and the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.Black Rock Group, a media consulting firm Dubke co-founded that's not affiliated with investment firm BlackRock, was previously paid more than $100,000 by Cheney's campaign in 2018. Dubke and Black Rock Group did not return requests for comment.

The Cheney campaign paid more than $600,000 for SCM's help with direct mail advertising. The Trump campaign paid SCM more than $8 million during the 2020 election cycle, according to campaign finance data.TAG Strategies, a political marketing firm that worked for Trump in the 2020 campaign and several of his endorsed candidates in the midterms, was paid almost $380,000 by Cheney's campaign for digital and marketing services, including over $100,000 in May, according to FEC records. Trump's campaign paid TAG Strategies more than $200,000 during the 2020 election cycle.Erin Perrine, a vice president at TAG who also worked communications for Trump's reelection bid, told CNBC in an email that the firm's work for Cheney was a ""one-off service at one point during the primary."" She said that ""TAG is a Republican firm and we do work for America First, Conservative, and center-right candidates.""SCM did not return a request for comment."
2022-08-23,"Here are the most important news items that investors need to start their trading day: The major U.S. stock indices indicated a slightly higher open Tuesday, the morning after a rout that dealt a serious blow to the summer equities rally. The Dow fell over 600 points Monday, while the S&P 500 suffered a 2.14% drop. The Nasdaq fell by the biggest percentage of the three, 2.55%, to conclude its worst day since late June. On Tuesday, as investors anticipate what Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other central bank officials will say later this week at Jackson Hole, they will also digest a new round of retail earnings, including Macy's and Dick's Sporting Goods; and economic data, including new home sales. Follow live market updates here. It's a madhouse. AMC, the meme-stock movie theater chain, unleashed its so-called APE units on the market Monday, making for a thrilling sideshow as investors contended with broader market declines. The APEs, a new share class for AMC investors, effectively act as a dividend and resemble a stock split in some ways. They're also CEO Adam Aron's latest attempt to appeal to meme-stock investors who refer to themselves as ""apes."" AMC's shares finished Monday down more than 40%. But, as CNBC's Jesse Pound points out, the combined value of an AMC share and an APE unit at the close was about 8.7% below AMC's closing price on Friday. Video-call platform Zoom on Monday cut its full-year revenue and profit outlook, citing shifts in buying patterns. The company, which was a pandemic favorite as people worked from home and relatives kept in touch fro afar, has seen its revenue growth slow down as more employees call staff back to work at their offices and people go out again. ""We have implemented initiatives focused on driving new online subscriptions, which have shown early promise but were not enough to overcome the macro dynamics in the quarter,"" the company's chief financial officer told analysts in a conference call Monday. Even after the final season of ""Game of Thrones"" suffered so much backlash among fans and critics, audiences were still pumped to watch the first episode of HBO's new prequel series, ""House of the Dragon,"" on Sunday night. HBO said late Monday that the premiere had nearly 10 million viewers on its traditional cable service and its streaming platform HBO Max, making it the most-watched debut of a series in the network's history. That marks a huge win for the newly merged HBO parent company Warner Bros. Discovery and its CEO, David Zaslav. WBD is in a period of upheaval as it aims to combine HBO Max and Discovery+ next year, while trimming costs and reshaping the overall business, which also includes CNN and the Warner Bros. production studio. An ex-Apple employee who allegedly stole trade secrets about the tech giant's car division pleaded guilty Monday, four years after he was arrested trying to fly to China. The engineer, Xiaolang Zhang, faces up to 10 years in prison. His sentencing is set for November. The former employee was accused of downloading files about Apple's hush-hush automobile project, including a document featuring schematics of a circuit board for a possible autonomous vehicle. There's another former Apple employee who is accused of similar crimes, too: Jizhong Chen, a U.S. citizen who had also planned to travel to China, has not pleaded guilty and is represented by Zhang's lawyer, as well.— CNBC's Samantha Subin, Jesse Pound, Jordan Novet, Sarah Whitten and Kif Leswing contributed to this report.— Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every stock move.

2022-08-26,"Bitcoin could be poised for outsized gains if recent technical signals regarding mining hash rate are to be believed.Hash rate, studied in various ways, is used by crypto investors to try to figure out when the market might bottom.One indicator known as ""hash ribbons"" recently flashed a ""buy signal,"" according to one analyst. Bitcoin could be poised for outsized gains if recent technical signals are to be believed.Investors have been searching for a bottom to bitcoin since the cryptocurrency lost more than 60% of its value from the all-time high of nearly $69,000 it hit in November. Nearly $2 trillion has been wiped off the entire crypto market in recent months.related investing newsMorgan Stanley sees a sign that points to a top in bitcoinTanaya Macheela day agoA measure of activity of bitcoin miners could give investors a clue as to where the digital currency is headed next.Miners validate transactions on the bitcoin network using highly-specialized and power-intensive computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles. They are rewarded in bitcoin for their efforts. As more bitcoin is mined, solving these puzzles becomes more difficult.During market slumps, a depressed bitcoin price can make it unprofitable for many miners to continue operations. They then sell some bitcoin to keep afloat. But they also turn off their mining rigs to save money.That has happened in the latest market slump and can be demonstrated by ""hash rate,"" a measure of computational power used to mine bitcoin. Since mid-May, when the market really started to sell-off, the 30-day average hash rate (a monthly average value) fell more than 7% and at one point saw a 10% dip. That signaled that miners were turning off their machines.Hash rate, studied in various ways, is used by crypto investors to try to figure out when the market might bottom, because capitulation and a shakeout of the miners is often associated with the late stage of a bitcoin cycle.""Historically speaking, capitulation in the mining market has tended to correspond strongly with overall market bottoms,"" Matthew Kimmell, digital asset analyst at CoinShares, told CNBC via email. Following on from this, Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative crypto fund Capriole Investments, came up with the idea of ""hash ribbons"" in 2019 to identify buying opportunities for bitcoin.When the 30-day moving average for hash rate dips below the 60-day moving average, this is called a bearish cross, and signals that miners are shutting down machines. Usually selling is associated with these events. As more miners are taken out of the market, the difficulty of mining bitcoin reduces because there is less competition.Because of the reduced competition, more miners may re-enter the market and a recovery may occur.""These 'capitulations' are painful events for miners within the ecosystem,"" Edwards told CNBC.But using Edwards' method, when the 30-day moving average for hash rate crosses back above the 60-day moving average, the worst of the miner capitulation tends to be over.

More recently, buying during the recent buy signal in August 2021, would have yielded a more than 50% return if bitcoin was sold at the November 2021 record high.""I created Hash Ribbons in 2019 as a way to identify when major Bitcoin mining capitulation had occurred, as once recovery resumes from these events, they typically mark major Bitcoin price bottoms,"" Edwards said. ""Historically, these have been great times to allocate into Bitcoin, with incredible returns.""Kimmell from CoinShares said that the logic behind the buy signal is that if the bitcoin price ""tends to steadily outpace hashrate before a period of high price growth, then a trending rebound in hashrate,"" marked by the 30 day moving average for hash rate crossing above the 60 day moving average, it ""may mean the rebound in bitcoin price has already begun.""""I find this metric should not be solely relied upon to make an investment decision, but can certainly be helpful if coupled with a suite of other metrics and qualitative evidence,"" he added. CoinShares has put together a graph to show the correlation between hash rate and the bitcoin price. And it is split into areas where there is ""gold rush"" as bitcoin's price rises, and a subsequent inventory flush and miners' shakeout as the price declines.In a chart provided to CNBC, CoinShares suggests that the market is currently in the shakeout period which typically precedes rebalancing and a rally in prices. Right now, according to the chart, the bitcoin price line is below the hash rate. But this could signal a bottom is near, according to Kimmell.""It is impossible to say if we have reached full capitulation, however there is evidence we are in the phase of the mining cycle where capitulation most often occurs. Secondarily, if previous cycles carry predictive power, then yes, bitcoin price steadily outpacing hashrate would likely precede a period of high price growth,"" Kimmell said.Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, holds a similar view.""I think we have seen broad signs of capitulation given the events in the previous months. Hence it is likely we could have the beginnings of a bottom being formed. Usually bitcoin consolidates in a range for a whole which indicates accumulation, which is what we may be seeing,"" Ayyar told CNBC via text message.Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range of around $18,000 to $25,000 since mid-June.However, there are risks that these indicators do not prove as positive as they have been in the past because of the broader macroeconomic environment.The current global economy is in a very different state versus previous cryptocurrency cycles. There is rampant inflation and rising interest rates globally, aspects which have not been present before.Risk assets such as U.S. stocks, and in particular the Nasdaq, to which bitcoin is closely correlated, have seen a big sell-off this year.""Of course all this is still based on historical similarity, and we are in a different macro environment,"" Ayyar said.""The major risk remains the economy and inflation, but even then we are closer to an inflation peak than not, and hence this also shows that on risk assets we are closer to a bottom than not."""
2022-08-26,"Digital currency prices have crashed massively since their peak in November sparking a new ""crypto winter"" — a period of prolonged depressed prices.But Edith Yeung, a general partner at Race Capital, said it will be a ""warm winter"" because it will push out people from the industry who were there for short-term gain. However, the crypto market has been plagued by liquidity issues and the bankruptcy of major players including Celsius and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  A crypto winter is here but it's going to be a ""warm winter,"" according to one crypto bull.Bitcoin may have fallen by more than half from record levels, but ""there's so much more than that,"" said Edith Yeung, a general partner at Race Capital.related investing newsMorgan Stanley sees a sign that points to a top in bitcoinTanaya Macheel13 hours agoIt’s been a month since the big Shapella upgrade. Here’s how Ethereum has changed since thenTanaya Macheela day ago""In some sense, the 'warm winter' is basically going to push out everybody who really [wants to be] there for short-term gain,"" she told CNBC's Street Signs Asia last week, highlighting that cryptocurrency is a long-term play.The term crypto winter refers to a prolonged period of depressed digital coin prices in the market.Cryptocurrencies have lost around $1.9 trillion in value since the height of a massive rally in 2021.Bitcoin, the world's biggest digital coin, is about 68% off its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November.Yeung said she remains bullish long-term on digital tokens because its appeal lies in the fact that ""crypto is really about Web3."" Web3 has become a buzzword among those in the crypto industry. Proponents say it's the next generation of the internet, one that is ""decentralized"" and not owned by a few big technology giants.Advocates suggest that crypto and blockchain technology could be a big part of that. For example, a Web3 service may run on a particular blockchain such as ethereum or solana. Users may be required to hold tokens associated with those blockchains in order to use a particular service or even have ownership in that app or company. ""I think there's a whole generation of internet [users who] really believe that 'you cannot monetize my data anymore ... the internet should be owned by us,'"" Yeung told CNBC.""That's why there's such a push with crypto because the ownership of ethereum or solana is really the user owning that piece of token, which is only a piece of that internet."" Even though Yeung suggested it would be a ""warm winter"" for the crypto market, the troubles for the industry have so far been unprecedented.The nearly $2 trillion plunge in the value of cryptocurrencies was sparked by the sudden collapse of an algorithmic stablecoin called terraUSD which saw its sister token luna become worthless. Several crypto firms, including the now-bankrupt hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, had a large exposure to terraUSD.Meanwhile, lending firms like Celsius, which took on risky trading bets, faced liquidity issues and also filed for bankruptcy.These issues have led to contagion across the cryptocurrency industry.James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, is one skeptic of the term ""warm winter."" The crypto winter has been ""brutal,"" he said, citing the fall of Three Arrows and the drastic drop in bitcoin prices.""Bitcoin prices have fallen by 74% peak to trough at one point — this closely matches the 83% decline seen in 2018 and must be taken in the context that the market is significantly bigger and has a much broader investor base now than it had back in 2018,"" Butterfill told CNBC in an email on Monday. The biggest challenge right now for crypto lies in the uncertainty surrounding the Fed's monetary policy and if the central bank will slow the pace of interest rate hikes, said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank.Markets are anticipating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech on the Fed's next policy move at the Jackson Hole summit on Friday. Any slowdown in the pace of rate hikes could be positive for crypto markets, Hasegawa said.""I think the Fed will gradually have to face and address some signs of economic slowdown soon, so my mid-term outlook is somewhat optimistic,"" Hasegawa said.Meanwhile, Butterfill pointed out that predicting the Fed is challenging as the economic picture remains mixed.""A move to become less hawkish could be very supportive of Bitcoin prices. As hawkish Fed policy initiated this bear market in December/January, so could a dovish stance prompt it to break out of its $20,000–$25,000 trading range,"" he said. Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, is the token native to the ethereum blockchain. Sol is the native cryptocurrency of solana, a public blockchain that supports decentralized finance apps that aim to recreate traditional financial systems, like banks and exchanges.Asked if ethereum has stronger underlying fundamentals than bitcoin, Yeung from Race Capital said the two cryptocurrencies are ""very different.""

Luno's Ayyar said that in forming a bottom, ""bitcoin typically likes to go back and test previous lows to see if they hold as support.""He said that unless bitcoin falls below $17,500, then the market is likely consolidating within the $18,000 to $24,000 range.In the meantime, ether and so-called altcoins, or alternative coins, have managed to rise further than bitcoin. Ether has outpaced bitcoin since both cryptocurrencies hit a low in June.Ether is the native cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network. Ethereum is planning a huge upgrade this month — known as the merge — that proponents say will make the network more efficient, and draw in new investors and drive bigger yields.""Ethereum hit yearly highs against the bitcoin pair in anticipation of the merge,"" Ayyar said. "" Hence there has been a lot more interest and activity in the Altcoin space, while Bitcoin consolidates."""
2022-09-07,"Fed Governor Michael Barr, whose title of vice chair for supervision gives him broad powers over the nation's banks, gave his first policy speech since being confirmed by the Senate.He pushed for action on stablecoins, climate change preparations and both the safety and fairness of the finance industry.Barr presides now over a financial system that is generally thought to be well capitalized but was still hit by market disruptions requiring Fed intervention in the early days of the Covid crisis. The Federal Reserve's new banking regulator outlined a broad agenda in a speech Wednesday that pushed for action on stablecoins, climate change preparations and both the safety and fairness of the finance industry.Fed Governor Michael Barr, whose title of vice chair for supervision gives him broad powers over the nation's banks, gave his first policy speech since being confirmed by the Senate.Among his priorities: a push for Congress to enact comprehensive regulation over stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, often currencies.He also said that next year the Fed will launch an exercise ""to better assess the long-term, climate-related financial risks facing the largest institutions.""And he said a push for a system that is not only financially sound but also fair, particularly to those at the lower end of the income spectrum with less access to banking services, would be a major priority.""Fairness is fundamental to financial oversight, and I am committed to using the tools of regulation, supervision, and enforcement so that businesses and households have access to the services they need, the information necessary to make their financial decisions, and protection from unfair treatment,"" Barr said in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.Barr presides now over a financial system that is generally thought to be well capitalized but was still hit by market disruptions requiring Fed intervention in the early days of the Covid crisis. The rise of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins also has posed challenges for the Fed, which is exploring a potential digital currency of its own.He called for increased scrutiny of the crypto industry and the risks that it poses.""Stablecoins, like other unregulated private money, could pose financial stability risks,"" Barr said. ""I believe Congress should work expeditiously to pass much-needed legislation to bring stablecoins, particularly those designed to serve as a means of payment, inside the prudential regulatory perimeter.""On climate change, Barr waded into an area that has drawn criticism from some Republican congressional leaders who believe the Fed is overstepping its mandate.Barr said the Fed wants to understand the risks that climate events pose to the system, while acknowledging that the central bank's interest on the issue is ""important, but narrow.""Along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC, the Fed is working up ways it wants banks to ""identify, measure, monitor, and manage the financial risks of climate change. In addition, we are considering how to develop and implement climate risk scenario analyses.""On the fairness issue, Barr said he wants a system that provides consumers with access to services and information to protect them from abuse.""As innovative financial products develop and grow rapidly, excitement can outrun the proper assessment of risk,"" he said. ""As we have seen with the growth of crypto assets, in a rapidly rising and volatile market, participants may come to believe that they understand new products only to learn that they don't, and then suffer significant losses.""Barr said he also will work to ensure that banks that participate in crypto-related endeavors have risk controls in place."
2022-09-07,"GameStop said quarterly sales declined and losses widened, as its cash pile shrank and inventory swelled.The company also disclosed a new partnership with crypto exchange FTX.As sales declined overall, GameStop, which launched an NFT marketplace in July, pointed to growth of some newer businesses. GameStop said Wednesday that quarterly sales declined and losses widened, as it burned through cash and inventory swelled.The video game retailer also disclosed a new partnership with crypto exchange FTX.Shares of the company rose more than 6% in premarket trading Thursday.In the second fiscal quarter ended July 30, the company's total sales dropped to $1.14 billion from $1.18 billion in the year-ago period. Its losses widened to $108.7 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with a loss of $61.6 million, or 21 cents, a year prior.GameStop's results cannot be compared with estimates because too few analysts cover the company. It did not provide a financial outlook and hasn't provided one since the start of the pandemic.The brick-and-mortar retailer is trying to adapt its business to a digital world. It's gotten new leadership, including board chair Ryan Cohen, the founder of Chewy and former activist investor for Bed Bath & Beyond, and CEO Matt Furlong, an Amazon veteran. It's also looked to new ways to make money, including nonfungible tokens.But the company has struggled to drive profits, leading it to trim costs and shake up leadership. Last month, it fired chief financial officer Mike Recupero and laid off employees across departments. Accounting chief Diana Jajeh stepped in as the company's new CFO.Furlong urged patience on an investor call on Wednesday, saying GameStop must go through a significant transformation to keep up with customers.""Our path to becoming a more diversified and tech-centric business is one that obviously carries risk and will take time,"" he said. ""This said, we believe GameStop is a much stronger business than it was 18 months ago.""GameStop's new initiatives have come at a high cost. It had $908.9 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter — a little more than half of what it had at the end of the year-ago period.Inventory ballooned to $734.8 million at the close of the quarter. That's up from $596.4 million at the close of the prior year's second quarter. The company said in a release that it intentionally bulked up on merchandise to keep up with customer demand and cope with supply chain challenges.Furlong said on the call that the company had to spend money to modernize its business after years of underinvestment. Among its moves, it hired more than 600 people with talent in areas such as blockchain while it reduced shipping times, so customers get purchases in one to three days. Now, he said, the company is focused on new priorities: becoming profitable, launching proprietary products and investing in its stores. He said it is lowering costs, too. Expenses decreased by 14% from the first quarter of the year, including some reductions that came from the layoffs.""We're going to retain a strong focus on cost containment and continue promoting an ownership mentality across the organization,"" he said.As overall sales fell, he pointed to growth of newer businesses. GameStop launched an NFT marketplace in July, which is open to the public for beta testing. It allows users to connect their own digital asset wallets, including the recently launched GameStop Wallet, so they can buy, sell and trade NFTs for virtual goods.Sales attributable to collectibles rose from $177.2 million in the prior year's second quarter to $223.2 million in the most recent one.NFTs trade on FTX, the retailer's new partner. ""In addition to collaborating with FTX on new ecommerce and online marketing initiatives, GameStop will begin carrying FTX gift cards in select stores,"" GameStop said in a release.FTX was founded by billionaire former Wall Street trader Sam Bankman-Fried, 30. He has become a lender of last resort for crypto firms that have struggled as the assets have declined sharply since late last year.The agreement with FTX appears to play into GameStop's status as a meme stock.The company's shares have seen sharp fluctuations in value. Over the past year, shares have swung from $19.39 to $63.92. The company's stock is down about 36% so far this year, bringing the company's value to $7.31 billion.Even as the company pivots more to e-commerce, Furlong said that stores remain an important way to connect with customers and to fulfill online orders.GameStop rolled out a new compensation model for U.S. store leaders, he said. Each store leader can get $21,000 in stock, which vests over three years. They can also get additional pay through company stock on a quarterly basis, depending on their performance.It is also raising hourly pay for some store employees, but he did not share the specific wage.Read GameStop's earnings release here."
2022-09-08,"The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Thursday warned that cryptocurrency mining operations could hinder the country's ability to mitigate climate change.Crypto operations in the U.S. now consume as much energy as all home computers or all residential lighting, the White House said in a report. The report is a result of President Joe Biden's executive order in March that called on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies.  The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Thursday warned that cryptocurrency mining operations could hinder the country's ability to mitigate climate change. It also said federal agencies should consider information from crypto miners and local utilities ""in a privacy-preserving manner"" to help understand and mitigate the problem.Crypto operations in the U.S. now consume as much energy as all home computers or all residential lighting, the White House said in a report. The findings come amid mounting criticism over the amount of electricity that crypto mining operations produce.The process of cryptocurrency mining involves running banks of computers to solve complicated math equations in order to create new coins and validate transactions. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, is wedded to this ""proof of work"" system, although the second-most poplar currency, ether, is moving to a different method that may not require as much energy.U.S. crypto production represents between 0.2% and 0.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and between 0.4% and 0.8% of domestic emissions, respectively, though the estimates are uncertain, the report said. Mining crypto produces planet-warming emissions primarily by burning coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels to generate electricity.This year, crypto mining produced between 110 and 170 million metric tons on carbon pollution across the world and roughly 25 to 50 million metric tons in the U.S. alone, the report said. The process produces electricity by purchasing it from the power grid or by producing and disposing of computers and mining infrastructure.

The report is a result of President Joe Biden's executive order in March that called on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. The president has pledged to reduce U.S. emissions from 2005 levels at least in half by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.The report said that global crypto mining emissions are greater than the emissions of many individual countries and equivalent to the global emissions from all barges, tankers and other ships on inland waterways. Additionally, Bitcoin, the world's largest digital currency by market value, generates approximately two-thirds of global crypto greenhouse gas emissions."
2022-09-08,"Coinbase is backing a lawsuit filed against the Treasury Department Thursday by six users of a recently sanctioned crypto service.Treasury said the service helped launder billions from state-sponsored bad actors. But crypto enthusiasts argue that sanctioning crypto code is an overstep and could cause negative ripple effects in the tech industry.""It sets a dangerous precedent,"" Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, tells CNBC.  Coinbase is footing the bill for a lawsuit filed against the Treasury Department Thursday by users of the recently sanctioned crypto service, Tornado Cash.The six plaintiffs include Coinbase employees and other users of the mixing service that was blacklisted by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August.Mixing services like Tornado Cash are used to obfuscate crypto transactions, which while anonymous, are easily traceable. The Treasury Department argued this particular service was used to launder more than $7 billion worth of digital currency in the past three years by North Korean hackers and other bad actors.But in some cases, mixing services are used for legitimate privacy reasons. One plaintiff, a senior security risk analyst at Coinbase, used the service to anonymize donations to Ukraine out of fear his address would be targeted by Russian hacking groups. Another had concerns about his family's security.""Each is an American who simply wants to engage in entirely lawful activity in private,"" according to the lawsuit.The sanctions were a unique move by Treasury to blacklist open source software, versus an entity or person. Crypto enthusiasts have argued that the move was an overstep, sets a new legal precedent and could cause negative ripple effects for the tech industry.""We saw this as a much larger problem,"" Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, told CNBC. ""It sets a dangerous precedent -- if this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law, any technology any tool or system could be fair game.""Grewal, former deputy general counsel at Facebook, said it could have a chilling effect on innovation. He likened the Tornado Cash scenario to police chasing armed robbers on a highway. In order to catch the criminals, ""we wouldn't ban all use of that highway."" Grewal said it was the first time Coinbase has financially supported an external lawsuit and plans to pay for the plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as other costs associated with pursuing the claims in federal court.Thursday's suit argues that the move went a step beyond Treasury's authority, and as Coinbase put it in a blog post uses ""a hammer instead of a scalpel."" The plaintiffs argue it caused financial harm as their money is still locked on Tornado Cash, and hurt users relying on the tools for privacy reasons. The case asks the Court to remove Tornado Cash smart contracts from the U.S. sanctions list.Coinbase is the largest U.S. crypto exchange by trading volume and has publicly advocated for crypto reforms in Washington, while dealing with a series of recent SEC probes. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested information from Coinbase about the listing of cryptocurrencies that the agency argues may have been unregistered securities. The SEC is also looking into its crypto rewards program, known as staking.""We have advocated for regulatory reform across Washington and that work will continue,"" Grewal said. ""We can continue to cooperate and partner with the agencies that are being challenged in this instance, because this is not about questioning anyone's good faith, but it is about assuring that the rule of law applies."""

2022-09-14,"The Ethereum blockchain, the largest behind bitcoin, is about to undergo the beginnings of a major upgrade.Dubbed the ""merge,"" Ethereum is switching to a more energy-efficient method of validating transactions that take place on the platform, known as proof of stake.The upgrade is similar to how the transition away from using dial-up modems to fiberoptics enabled the internet to be used for a wider variety of things, such as video, online storage and music streaming, Greg King, founder and CEO of Osprey Funds, tells CNBC Make It.Here's a look at what the merge means and how it will affect crypto investors.  The merge will transition the blockchain from a proof-of-work (PoW) model to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model. Both are algorithms used to allow users to add new cryptocurrency transactions and keep a record of them on a blockchain network.The current proof-of-work model requires massive amounts of energy to power computers that race to solve complicated math equations in order to validate transactions.Proof of stake, on the other hand, requires users to have a ""stake"" in the blockchain, as the name implies.This means that Ethereum users will need to make a pretty hefty investment upfront in order to authenticate transactions. However, this model is expected to be much less energy intensive. Although the Ethereum merge isn't expected to make the network faster or lower transaction costs immediately, investors may see benefits down the road.""While no outcome is certain, the merge could be bullish for crypto investors in the long run due to the groundwork it lays for future upgrades to speed, fees and ecosystem development,"" says King.Quicker transactions and lower fees could eventually lead to more users as well, which could affect the value of ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, which investors use to make transactions of the platform.If the number of investors increases, the supply of ether should go down, says Vladimir Gorbunov, CEO and founder of the MetaFi ecosystem Choise.com. And as the supply of ether decreases, the value of individual coins could increase, which would be welcome news for investors.Ether is valued at about $1,600 per coin as of Sept. 14, 2022, according to Coin Metrics — down from an all-time high of about $4,892 in November of last year. As previously mentioned, the merge is expected to make the blockchain more energy efficient. Currently, Ethereum's carbon emissions are on par with Singapore and its total energy consumption is comparable to the Netherlands, according to its website.The merge is expected to lower Ethereum's carbon footprint by over 99%, which could make the platform more attractive to environmentally conscious investors. ""The merge will definitely make Ethereum more secure,"" says Gorbunov. After the merge, the required initial investment to validate transactions on the blockchain would cost around $55,000 or 33 ETH, he says.That's a cost everyone, including hackers, would have to bear in order to get into the network in the first place. Due to that barrier, Gorbunov expects Ethereum to become a lot safer.However, the blockchain will always be vulnerable to hackers, King warns.""After the merge, Ethereum's susceptibilities may differ due to the underlying design change to the network, but the security risks will always remain the same,"" he says. ""Cybersecurity risk is always paramount.""Remember, ether, like many cryptocurrencies, is a highly volatile asset that is subject to unpredictable fluctuations in value with no guarantee of earning a profit.

It's time for the ""merge.""The years-in-the-making, systemwide upgrade to the ethereum blockchain is set to roll out on Wednesday, marking one of the crypto sector's most historic events to date. Leading up to the overhaul, investors have been jumping into ether, the native token to ethereum.In the past three months, ether has jumped 32%, dramatically outperforming bitcoin, which has dropped 9%. While analysts say that anticipation around the merge has helped pump up the price, some experts see the real upside coming after the merge takes place.""We believe post-merge the bull case for ethereum is going to be a lot stronger for a number of reasons,"" said Katie Talati, head of research at asset management firm Arca. The main factor, she says, is that supply is going to come way down, creating scarcity.The hallmark of ethereum's big makeover is that it will take a lot less energy to verify transactions, which has long been a major problem for the crypto industry. The proof-of-stake model, which is replacing the proof-of-work model, requires validators on the network to put up their ether tokens, or ""stake"" them, essentially pulling them out of circulation for an extended period of time, in order to secure the network.""For probably six to 12 months — there's no defined guidance yet from developers on ethereum — you will not be able to withdraw your ethereum once you've staked it to validate the network,"" Talati said. Slashing energy consumption by more than 99% will also go a long way toward lowering the barrier to entry for institutional investors, who have been battling the optics of contributing to the climate crisis. The White House last week released a report warning that proof-of-work mining operations could get in the way of efforts to mitigate climate change.Still, some skepticism has been creeping into the market.Ether is down around 6% in the last 24 hours following the latest official read on inflation in the U.S., which punished risky assets on Tuesday and drove tech stocks to their worst day in over two years.Whether to buy now or wait and see how the merge goes depends on an investor's time horizon for holding the coins, said Jaydeep Korde, CEO of ethereum infrastructure builder Launchnodes. Korde tells CNBC that traders who plan to sit on their stake for the long term — in the range of two to three years — should be in good shape.""If you're looking in the shorter-term horizon in terms of trading, I think that it's much more volatile,"" Korde said. He cited global economic conditions, geopolitics and inflation as playing into the immediate risk.""Ethereum will suffer the challenges of that volatility, like every other asset class,"" Korde said. With the upgrade, ethereum won't become faster, cheaper or more scalable. One developer even told CNBC that if the user experience feels the same, that will be one sign that the merge was a total success.The real investor draw is the slashing of energy usage, especially as bitcoin mining continues to face blowback for its growing power consumption.Since its creation almost a decade ago, ether has — similar to bitcoin — been mined through a proof-of-work model. It involves complex math equations that massive numbers of machines race to solve, and it uses an abundance of energy. The new proof-of-stake method requires users to leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and secure the network.

Here's where analysts see it heading next.These tech stocks have never been more compelling, Goldman Sachs saysBank of America says this chip stock is the best way to play the electric vehicle transition Bitcoin just posted its worst week of the year. Here's where analysts see it heading next.These tech stocks have never been more compelling, Goldman Sachs saysBank of America says this chip stock is the best way to play the electric vehicle transition According to one estimate on the Ethereum Foundation's blog, the merge will result in a reduction of at least 99.95% in total energy use.Bank of America said in a note on Sept. 9, that the significant reduction in energy consumption post-merge ""may enable some institutional investors to purchase the token that were previously prohibited from purchasing tokens that run on blockchains leveraging proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanisms.""Institutional money is key to the maturation of digital assets. Research firm Fundstrat wrote in a note that a successful merge would cement ethereum as the ""premier blockchain network.""Ethereum has set itself apart from rival chains, as more of an operating system for the industry. The vast majority of apps are built on top of ethereum, and the merge is the first in a series of planned upgrades that should ultimately result in faster and cheaper transactions.  The reduced supply of the cryptocurrency, which some investors say could be a boon to the price, is the result of a new verification model that replaces miners with ""validators.""The rewards for validators are much smaller than those that went to proof-of-work miners, meaning that less ether will be minted as a result of this upgrade.Additionally, as part of an upgrade that went into effect last August, the network is already ""burning,"" or permanently destroying, a portion of the digital currency that would otherwise be recycled back into circulation.Talati says that people may look back in three to six months and say, ""That was the inflection point and the turning point for ethereum.""The bitcoin network experiences a similar type of supply reduction roughly every four years.Bitcoin's production declines exponentially over time, thanks to something called ""the halvening"" or ""the halving,"" when the size of the prize for miners is cut in half. The halving was built into bitcoin's code by its pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, as a way to stave off inflation of the cryptocurrency. ""Bitcoin can't issue any more shares,"" Fundstrat's Tom Lee previously told CNBC. ""It doesn't do stock splits or dividends, so the only way to increase the network value of bitcoin is for the unit price to go up.""There have been three halvings of bitcoin, to date. The last one, in May 2020, preceded a steep rally that continued through late 2021, before the crypto ""winter"" began.For ether, the website for Ultrasound Money has simulated the forthcoming supply changes. In its model, the annual issuance drops from 5.5 million tokens to 600,000 and estimates that the supply growth drops to 0.1% from 4.1%.Regardless of the changing dynamics that come with the merge, the crypto market is likely to still be driven in part by a hefty dose of pure speculation and events that have nothing to do with the fundamentals of the tokens or blockchain networks.The steep selloff this year — ether is down 56% even after the recent rally — is tied to rising interest rates and the Federal Reserve's effort to tamp down inflation.Investors have been rotating out of risky assets, even those that are supposed to act as a hedge against inflation, so the merge may not immediately change investor sentiment.WATCH: Bitcoin falls below $19,000 as Ethereum upgrade kicks into full gear"
2022-09-15,"The price of ether fell Thursday after the Ethereum network completed its migration to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, also known as the ""merge.""Ether was last down 5.6% to $1,501.88, after falling as low as $1,459.00 earlier, according to Coin Metrics. Traders had expected to see a decline in the price following the transition late Wednesday night.""It is important to recognise that the merge has already been largely priced,"" said Anto Paroian, CEO of crypto hedge fund ARK36. ""Ethereum has already appreciated more than 100% since its June lows. It seems likely, then, that if the Merge turns out to have a positive effect on Ethereum's price action, the upside may not be sustainable.""After the value of cryptocurrencies tumbled in the first half of the year with other risk assets, ether rallied to start the second half and has been outperforming bitcoin since. It advanced almost 70% in July alone, compared with bitcoin's 27% gain, according to Coin Metrics. In August it fell almost 9.3%, compared to bitcoin's almost 17% loss.""Many investors expect it to be a 'sell the news' type of event which means that, after the initial surge, we may actually see the price of Ethereum drop within the next few days or weeks, especially given that, just like the rest of the crypto markets, ETH is still very much driven by the negative macroeconomic outlook,"" Paroian said. Loading chart... Investors have been cheering Ethereum's planned tech upgrade for months for its ability to turn ether into a yield-generating asset and to improve the security of the network in an energy efficient way. Many have called it one of the most important moments in crypto's short history.Many in the crypto market have also been monitoring a popular trade: investors have been buying spot ether and shorting ether perpetual futures, in order to get tokens of the ""forked"" version of Ethereum for free without the ether price exposure. Some analysts have said they expect to see that trade unwind after the merge.""Now that the merge has happened, traders and funds are positioning themselves out of it, that trade is kind of over,"" Jason Lau, chief operating officer at Okcoin, told CNBC's ""Crypto World"" Thursday.""On the other side, asset managers and holders are actually positioning themselves ahead of a longer-term game,"" he added. ""The Ethereum merge is really just one step in a sphere in a long series of upgrades that will lead to more scalability will lead to an upgrade in performance of the Ethereum network.""Still, the market remains largely macro-driven. The price of ether was little changed for much of the morning but turned lower in tandem with stocks, particularly the Nasdaq Composite, which was down 1.4%. Bitcoin, whose correlation with stocks hit an all-time high this year, was down by less than 1%."
2022-09-15,"Ethereum's biggest-ever upgrade just took effect, in what industry experts are calling a game changer for the entire crypto sector.Thus far, all signs suggest the so-called merge — which is designed to cut the cryptocurrency's energy consumption by more than 99% — was a success. Ethereum's biggest-ever upgrade just took effect, in what industry experts are calling a game changer for the entire crypto sector. Thus far, all signs suggest the so-called merge — which is designed to cut the cryptocurrency's energy consumption by more than 99% — was a success.The very first proof-of-stake block of transactions has finalized with a nearly 100% client participation rate. This was, by far, the best-case scenario.The overhaul to the ethereum network fundamentally alters the way the blockchain secures its network and verifies transactions. Most of these changes are happening under the hood and the hallmark of a successful upgrade is if the end user doesn't feel a difference in the hours and days ahead.Cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and bitcoin are often criticized for the process of mining to generate new coins. Before the merge, both blockchains had their own vast network of miners all over the planet running highly specialized computers that crunched math equations in order to validate transactions. Proof-of-work uses a lot of energy, and it is one of the industry's biggest targets for critiques.But with the upgrade, ethereum has migrated to a system known as proof-of-stake, which swaps out miners for validators. Instead of running large banks of computers, validators leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens. This requires far less power than mining and experts say it will make the protocol both more secure and more sustainable.The price of ether jumped following the merge. It is trading at around $1,640, up more than 3% in the last hour. Nine teams and more than 100 developers worked on the merge for years. In the hours ahead, this decentralized network of programmers spread out across the planet will monitor the rollout and, if needed, debug as fast as possible.Danny Ryan, a core developer based in Denver who has been working on the merge for five years, tells CNBC that they will be watching for any irregularities via both automated and manual monitoring systems. If issues come up, the corresponding team will debug and release a patch to users, but Ryan says they are pretty confident going into the merge given all the successful dry runs in the last few months.""There might be some sort of small fire that gets put out very quickly,"" said Ryan. ""But the network as a whole — because of the redundancy across all this different software — will very likely be stable and fine."" Part of why the merge is such a big deal has to do with optics.Last week, the White House released a report warning that proof-of-work mining operations could get in the way of efforts to mitigate climate change. Slashing energy consumption by roughly 99.95% will not only establish greater sustainability for the network, but it will also go a long way toward lowering the barrier to entry for institutional investors, who struggled with the optics of contributing to the climate crisis. Bank of America said in a note on Sept. 9 that the significant reduction in energy consumption post-merge ""may enable some institutional investors to purchase the token that were previously prohibited from purchasing tokens that run on blockchains leveraging proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanisms.""Analysts have said that institutional money entering the digital asset space at scale is critical to its future as an asset class.The upgrade also changes the tokenomics around ethereum's native coin, ether.""Ether itself becomes a productive asset,"" said Ryan. ""It's not something you might just speculate on, but it's something that can earn returns.""In this post-merge era, ether takes on some of the characteristics typical of a traditional financial asset, such as a certificate of a deposit, which pays interest to holders.""It's probably the lowest risk return inside of the ethereum ecosystem,"" explained Ryan, who added that yield in other corners of decentralized finance, or DeFi, involve taking on smart contract risks and other types of counter-party risk. The upgrade will also result in a significantly reduced supply of ether tokens in circulation, which could pave the way for ether to become a deflationary currency in the weeks and months ahead. Some investors say this could also help drive up the price of the token.That reduced supply is the result of the new verification model that replaces miners with ""validators."" The rewards for validators are much smaller than those that went to proof-of-work miners, meaning that less ether will be minted as a result of this upgrade. Validators are also required to lock up their tokens for a prolonged period of time, pulling ether out of circulation.Additionally, as part of an upgrade that went into effect August 2021, the network is already ""burning"" or permanently destroying a portion of the digital currency that would otherwise be recycled back into circulation.

Behind the scenes, developers will be monitoring metrics like the participation rate of validators to determine how things are going. But coders tell CNBC that in an ideal world, users would be totally oblivious to the upgrade.""If everything goes perfectly, then an end user wouldn't notice a difference,"" said Anderson. ""If anyone who's trying to transact on ethereum doesn't realize it, then it was smooth."" The upgrade doesn't immediately make ethereum faster, cheaper or more scalable. But those features come with future upgrades that are now possible post-merge.Scalability, in particular, is something that Ryan says is desperately needed for the network going forward.At the moment, layer two technologies such as sharding and roll-ups are working to address just that.""More scalability, more ability to process user transactions is coming online in parallel through layer two constructions called roll-ups, but the scale is not being enhanced at the core protocol itself,"" continued Ryan. That comes in subsequent upgrades instead.Katie Talati, head of research at asset management firm Arca, says that her team is closely watching anything in the layer two space, especially the projects that are trying to offer scalability.""The biggest issue right now is that it's very fragmented,"" said Talati. ""You end up with these people who are now on ethereum, but they're siloed from each other, because the L2s don't necessarily talk to each other very easily. And so it's just not a seamless experience,"" she said."

2022-09-16,"The Biden White House has just released its first-ever framework on what crypto regulation in the U.S. should look like.The framework outlines the ways in which the financial services industry should evolve to make borderless transactions easier, as well as how to crack down on fraud in the digital asset space.The new guidelines follow an executive order issued in March, in which President Joe Biden called on federal agencies to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies and issue official reports on their findings. The Biden White House has just released its first-ever framework on what crypto regulation in the U.S. should look like — including ways in which the financial services industry should evolve to make borderless transactions easier, and how to crack down on fraud in the digital asset space.The new directives tap the muscle of existing regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, but nobody's mandating anything yet. The long-awaited direction from Washington has, however, captured the attention of both the crypto industry as a whole — and of investors in this nascent asset class.The framework follows an executive order issued in March, in which President Joe Biden called on federal agencies to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies and issue official reports on their findings.For six months, government agencies have been working to develop their own frameworks and policy recommendations to address half a dozen priorities listed in the executive order: consumer and investor protection; promoting financial stability; countering illicit finance; U.S. leadership in the global financial system and economic competitiveness; financial inclusion; and responsible innovation. Together, these recommendations comprise the first, ""whole-of-government approach"" to regulating the industry.Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, and national security advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement that the new guidelines are meant to position the country as a leader in governance of the digital assets ecosystem at home and abroad.Here are some of the key takeaways from the White House's new crypto framework. One section of the White House's new framework on crypto regulation focuses on eliminating illegal activity in the industry — and the measures proposed appear to have real teeth.""The President will evaluate whether to call upon Congress to amend the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-tip-off statutes, and laws against unlicensed money transmitting to apply explicitly to digital asset service providers — including digital asset exchanges and nonfungible token (NFT) platforms,"" according to a White House fact sheet. Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProHedge funds piled into these A.I. stocks during the first quarterWatch Elon Musk's full interview with CNBC's David Faber on Twitter, Tesla and A.I. advancesBank of America says buy these five tech stocks before it's too late Hedge funds piled into these A.I. stocks during the first quarterWatch Elon Musk's full interview with CNBC's David Faber on Twitter, Tesla and A.I. advancesBank of America says buy these five tech stocks before it's too late The president is also looking into whether to push Congress to raise the penalties for unlicensed money transmitting, as well as potentially amending certain federal statutes to allow the Department of Justice to prosecute digital asset crimes in any jurisdiction where a victim of those crimes is found.In terms of next steps, ""Treasury will complete an illicit finance risk assessment on decentralized finance by the end of February 2023 and an assessment on non-fungible tokens by July 2023,"" reads the fact sheet.Crime is rife in the digital asset sector. More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the Federal Trade Commission.Last month, the SEC said it charged 11 people for their roles in creating and promoting a fraudulent crypto pyramid and Ponzi scheme that raised more than $300 million from millions of retail investors worldwide, including in the United States. Meanwhile, in February, U.S. officials seized $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin — their biggest seizure of cryptocurrencies ever — related to the 2016 hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex. The framework also points to the potential for ""significant benefits"" from a U.S. central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which you can think of as a digital form of the U.S. dollar.Right now, there are several different types of digital U.S. dollars.Sitting in commercial bank accounts across the country are electronic U.S. dollars, which are partially backed by reserves, under a system known as fractional-reserve banking. As the name implies, the bank holds in its reserves a fraction of the bank's deposit liabilities. Transferring this form of money from one bank to another or from one country to another operates on legacy financial rails.There are also a spate of USD-pegged stablecoins, including Tether and USD Coin. Although critics have questioned whether tether has enough dollar reserves to back its currency, it remains the largest stablecoin on the planet. USD Coin is backed by fully reserved assets, redeemable on a 1:1 basis for U.S. dollars, and governed by Centre, a consortium of regulated financial institutions. It is also relatively easy to use no matter where you are.Then there's the hypothetical digital dollar that would be the Federal Reserve's take on a CBDC. This would essentially just be a digital twin of the U.S. dollar: Fully regulated, under a central authority, and with the full faith and backing of the country's central bank.""A dollar in CBDC form is a liability of the central bank. The Federal Reserve has to pay you back,"" said Ronit Ghose, who heads fintech and digital assets at Citi Global Insights.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell previously said the main incentive for the U.S. to launch its own central bank digital currency would be to eliminate the use case for crypto coins in America.""You wouldn't need stablecoins; you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies, if you had a digital U.S. currency,"" Powell said. ""I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.""In the White House's new framework, it points to the fact that a U.S. CBDC could enable a payment system that is ""more efficient, provides a foundation for further technological innovation, facilitates faster cross-border transactions, and is environmentally sustainable.""""It could promote financial inclusion and equity by enabling access for a broad set of consumers,"" continues the report.To that end, the administration urges the Fed to continue its ongoing research, experimentation and evaluation of a CBDC. Central bankers and U.S. lawmakers have for years bemoaned the rise of stablecoins, a specific subset of cryptocurrencies that have a value pegged to a real-world asset, such as a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or a commodity like gold.These nongovernmental digital tokens are increasingly being used in domestic and international transactions, which is scary for central banks because they don't have a say in how this space is regulated.In May, the collapse of TerraUSD, one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin projects, cost investors tens of billions of dollars as they pulled out in a panic that some have compared to a bank run. Widespread buy-in — and public PSAs — from respected financial institutions lent credibility to the project, further driving the narrative that the whole thing was legit.The implosion of this stablecoin project led to a series of insolvencies that erased nearly $600 billion in wealth, according to the White House.""Digital assets and the mainstream financial system are becoming increasingly intertwined, creating channels for turmoil to have spillover effects,"" according to the White House fact sheet.The framework goes on to single out stablecoins, warning that they could create disruptive runs if not paired with appropriate regulation.To make stablecoins ""safer,"" the administration says the Treasury will ""work with financial institutions to bolster their capacity to identify and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities by sharing information and promoting a wide range of data sets and analytical tools,"" as well as team up with other agencies to ""identify, track, and analyze emerging strategic risks that relate to digital asset markets.""Those efforts will also happen in concert with international allies, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Financial Stability Board."
2022-09-16,"Crypto companies have had a rough year as the price of digital assets plummeted. Yet Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX has emerged as an industry backstop, bailing out distressed lenders.The billionaire CEO says it came as a result of stashing cash on hand, keeping overhead low, avoiding crypto lending and an ability to sign deals quickly as a private company.""It was important that the industry get through this in one piece,"" Bankman-Fried tells CNBC. ""It's not going to be good for anyone long term if we have real pain and real blowouts."" FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been shopping for bargains amid the industry's recent carnage and said he still has cash to spend if opportunity knocks.It may seem strange. Other multibillion-dollar crypto giants spiraled into bankruptcy this year. FTX's main competitor, Coinbase, has seen its shares plunge 70% and has laid off a fifth of its workforce as crypto prices crashed.Yet, FTX is somehow emerging as an industry lifeline.The 30-year-old billionaire says it was a result of stashing away ample cash, keeping overhead low, avoiding lending and being able to move quickly as a private company.""It was important that the industry get through this in one piece,"" Bankman-Fried told CNBC in an interview at FTX headquarters in Nassau, Bahamas. ""It's not going to be good for anyone long term if we have real pain and real blowouts — it's not fair to customers and it's not going to be good for regulation.""The crypto industry saw billions of dollars wiped out during the weeks surrounding the implosion of cryptocurrency Terra USD and the failure of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Lenders with exposure to Three Arrows were the next domino to fall. In July, FTX signed a deal that gives it the option to buy lender BlockFi after providing a $250 million line of credit. FTX also extended $500 million to struggling Voyager Digital, which later declared bankruptcy, and was in discussions to acquire South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb.Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has lost more than half its value this year. While Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange FTX is suffering from the downturn in digital assets, he said market share growth helped offset the pain.""I don't think we're immune from it,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""But we put a lot of work in to growing our footprint over the last year ... and we have a less retail-heavy platform — retail tends to be more market sentiment dependent.""Most of FTX's volume comes from customers trading ""at least"" $100,000 per day, he said. Bankman-Fried described the group as ""highly engaged, high volume"" users that are ""fairly sophisticated."" It ranges from small quant trading firms to family offices and day traders. FTX's demographic has been less price sensitive and held up relatively well in crypto's bear market, according to the company. In addition to its success with professional traders, it's making an expensive land grab for the U.S. retail trading audience. FTX bought the the naming rights to the Miami Heat's NBA arena, formerly American Airlines Center. It has courted high-profile investors and brand ambassadors including Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen, and ran a Super Bowl ad featuring Larry David.The cryptocurrency exchange brought in roughly a billion dollars in revenue last year, CNBC reported in August. Bankman-Fried confirmed the numbers were in the ""right ballpark"" and this year would see a ""similar"" figure, depending on how severe the market slowdown is. He also said the company is profitable.He pointed to low employee head count as one factor accounting for profitability. FTX has roughly 350 employees -- about a tenth of Coinbase's workforce.""We've always tried to grow in a sustainable way -- I've always been deeply suspicious of negative unit economics, any economics without any sort of real, clear pathway to profitability,"" he said. ""We hired a lot less than most places did but we've also kind of kept our costs under control."" Loading chart... Bankman-Fried earned a degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and started his career as a quantitative trader at Jane Street Capital. He bought his first bitcoin five years ago, and said he was drawn to the industry by wide arbitrage opportunities that seemed ""too good to be true."" In 2017, Bankman-Fried launched proprietary trading firm Alameda Research to start trading the asset full time. The firm was making a million dollars a day in some cases, buying on an exchange in one market, and selling back on other global exchanges, according to the CEO.Alameda Research still accounts for about 6% of FTX's exchange volumes, according to documents seen by CNBC. While Bankman-Fried is still a major shareholder in Alameda, he stepped down from day-to-day operations.Bankman-Fried said he's worked over the past few years to eliminate conflicts of interest at Alameda. ""I don't run Alameda anymore — none of FTX does. We view it as a neutral piece of market infrastructure.""FTX has seen epic growth since Bankman-Fried launched it alongside co-founder Gary Wang in 2019. It last raised $400 million in January at a $32 billion valuation, bringing its total venture capital funding in the past three years to about $2 billion.FTX Trading Ltd. is headquartered in Antigua, with FTX Derivatives Markets based in the Bahamas, where Bankman-Fried lives. FTX Trading has acquired companies in Switzerland, Australia, Cyprus, Germany, Gibraltar, Singapore, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, among other countries.The exchange has spent about half of its cash on bailouts and acquisitions, most recently buying a 30% stake in Anthony Scaramucci's Skybridge Capital.""We still have a fair bit left to deploy, if and when it's useful or important,"" Bankman-Fried said. FTX benefited from being a private company this year. FTX doesn't have the daily ups and downs of a publicly traded stock, especially growth names, which this year have been battered by higher interest rates. Bankman-Fried also said not having thousands of shareholders enabled FTX to move quickly when trying to close deals in a matter of days.""I do think it makes it a lot harder, practically speaking, to do this as a public company,"" he said. When ""you have three days from start to finish to wire the money, you can't do a public engagement process around the potential terms of a messy situation.""Bankman-Fried said many of the deals were done in a matter of days, when the team ""didn't sleep much that week."" What's often lengthy due diligence came instead in a truncated Excel spreadsheet. The finances weren't audited. The team had at least some expectation of losing money. ""It was unclear if it would be net positive or negative — there was potential upside in a case where things went well,"" he said. ""We got to the point of feeling like we could do something that would have a nontrivial chance of helping for an amount of money that we were willing to lose if things went wrong.""It's too soon to tell if Bankman-Fried's distressed crypto bets will pay off. Some companies have said no to a rescue package altogether.After extending a line of credit to Voyager, FTX and Alameda looked to buy and and restructure the company. It outlined a plan to purchase Voyager's digital assets and loans at market value. The company responded to the bid calling it a ""low ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue.""""It surprised me. It didn't surprise our legal team,"" he said. ""I had honestly just assumed they'd see our offer and just say ... of course, we'll take this.""Bankman-Fried said there were further discussions and the answers were ""disappointing."" The problem, he said, was that the proposal didn't take any fees.""If you're in the business of taking fees, then maybe our proposal isn't what you like,"" he said. ""I believe it was a lowball offer for consultants looking to make fees on this case. That's not who I had had in mind. I had the customers in mind. But that is my current best understanding about what happened."" Bankman-Fried's latest moves in crypto have drawn comparisons with Warren Buffett's strategy in 2008. The legendary Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO stopped the bleeding during the financial crisis with a $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs. That eventually brought the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate a $3 billion gain.""There are some parallels,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""There are probably more differences. First of all, I don't think Warren Buffett would call me the next Warren Buffett. To the extent there is a parallel recently, it's been looking at which assets are in a place where they pretty badly need capital.""Bankman-Fried said he's finding spots where he can ""simultaneously make good investments, and help backstop them and their customers and ecosystem."" Although sometimes only one is on offer, not both.He also applauded Buffett's skill in long-term, value investing. The investor has showed that ""you don't need to have one brilliant innovation or insight, you can do it by just piecing together good decision after good decision over the course of decades and compounding that."" Like Buffett, Bankman-Fried signed the Giving Pledge: a promise by the world's wealthiest individuals to donate the majority of their wealth to charity. Bankman-Fried said he has given away roughly $100 million this year, with a focus on future pandemic prevention. Similar to Buffett, he lives modestly. Bankman-Fried shares a house with 10 roommates and a Goldendoodle named Gopher. He drives a Toyota Corolla, and said he has no interest in the excesses of a yacht or Lamborghini.But the two humble investors sharply diverge when it comes to their positions on cryptocurrencies.Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger have been critical of cryptocurrencies over the years. In 2018, for example, Buffett called bitcoin ""probably rat poison squared."" Earlier this year, Buffett said he wouldn't buy all the bitcoin in the world for $25 because it ""doesn't produce anything.""Buffett has called the underlying blockchain technology ""important"" — but hasn't wavered on the idea that ""bitcoin has no unique value at all."" Blockchains are digital databases that store cryptocurrency transactions and, in some cases, other data. Its main use has been powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But fans of the technology say it could be used in health care, supply chain logistics and other areas of finance.""I certainly disagree with that,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""I should hope [Buffett] disagrees with that, too. I don't think you should be running a company if he thinks that, but I don't think he actually thinks that. I think that was very likely hyperbole,"" he said. ""He's missed some of the power of blockchain — he's also missed some of the impetus for it in the first place, and what's driving people to want a new tool.""Correction: Gisele Bundchen is a brand ambassador for FTX.

2022-09-16,"Here are the most important news items that investors need to start their trading day: Wall Street was headed toward another down week with U.S. stock futures lower Friday. Traders were absorbing an ugly earnings warning from FedEx, which reported weakening global shipment volumes for its latest quarter and withdrew its full-year guidance. Earlier in the week, U.S. equities had their worst day since 2020 after August's consumer price index report showed headline inflation edged up 0.1% on a monthly basis, despite a drop in gas prices. That indicated an increasingly difficult pathway for the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation. Traders will get consumer sentiment data at 10 a.m. ET Friday, but the three major averages were on pace to notch their fourth losing week in five. Shares of FedEx plunged late Thursday after the company said it is aggressively cutting costs after weakening global shipping volumes dragged down results for the latest quarter. FedEx said it had anticipated demand to increase as factories in China opened back up with the easing of Covid pandemic restrictions. Instead, it said demand worldwide fell. CEO Raj Subramaniam said in an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer on ""Mad Money"" that the loss in volume was wide-reaching, and that the company has seen weekly declines since its investor day in June. He said that was an indication of poor economic conditions. ""We are a reflection of everybody else's business, especially the high-value economy in the world,"" Subramaniam said. The White House has released a long-awaited framework on what cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. should look like. The direction from Washington includes how the financial services industry should evolve to make borderless transactions easier and how to crack down on fraud in the digital asset space. The framework follows an executive order issued in March, in which President Joe Biden called on federal agencies to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies and issue official reports on their findings. One section of the White House's new framework on crypto regulation focuses on eliminating illegal activity in the industry — and the measures proposed appear to have real teeth. When Bed Bath & Beyond announced last month that it would close roughly 150 of its ""lower producing"" namesake stores, many people wondered if the location near them would be among those shuttered. Now the struggling home goods retailer has started identifying the stores marked for closure, with a list of 56 locations scattered around the U.S. The closures are part of a broader plan to try to stabilize the company's finances and turn around its declining sales. In late August, Bed Bath said that it secured more than $500 million in new financing ahead of the key holiday season and that it was trimming its workforce, in addition to the store closures. To see which stores it's shuttering, check out the map by CNBC's Gabriel Cortes. Kanye West, who goes by Ye, is ending the contract between his company, Yeezy, and Gap Inc. The partnership made headlines when it was announced in 2020, and the first product in the Yeezy Gap line − a bright blue puffer jacket − sold out within hours of its release a year later. But then in a letter sent by his lawyers Thursday, Yeezy told Gap that the retailer failed to meet its contract obligations, including the opening of dedicated Yeezy Gap stores. Gap CEO Mark Breitbard confirmed the break in a memo to employees later in the day, saying that the two parties shared a vision for Yeezy Gap, but that how they work to deliver the vision ""is not aligned.""

2022-09-19,"Jim Messina, a previous close advisor to former President Barack Obama has become a key advisor on Blockchain.com's government relations and policy strategy for the crypto company.The crypto industry has been ramping up its engagement with government officials around the world. Jim Messina, former President Barack Obama's deputy chief of staff, is bringing some hefty lobbying guidance to a London-based cryptocurrency trading platform as the industry braces for new regulations in the U.S. and abroad.The veteran political operative joined Blockchain.com's board early last year, becoming a key advisor on its government relations and policy strategy, chief business officer Lane Kasselman said in an interview with CNBC.The crypto industry has been ramping up lobbying around the world with potentially strict regulations on the horizon. The Biden administration released its framework on potential U.S. crypto regulations earlier this month, including ways that could help fight fraud.Kasselman described Messina as a critical guide to the company's lobbying and overall policy efforts. He noted that Messina is not a registered lobbyist, yet often advises their team on lobbying strategy.""You can say that we are probably one of the most prolific companies when it comes to public policy engagement related in crypto globally, certainly in the U.S. and western Europe. That's a direct result of Jim and his guidance on that front,"" Kasselman said. Messina, who was Obama's deputy chief of staff, is now the CEO of the consulting firm The Messina Group.Though Messina is not a registered lobbyist, the Messina Group has provided guidance on lobbying and other policy issues to Uber, Pillpack, Airbnb, Google, Delta Air Lines and Hutchison Whampoa, according to a list of clients on its website.Beyond his tenure advising Obama, Messina's firm has also advised powerful government officials, including former UK Prime Ministers Theresa May and David Cameron, along with Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto, Argentina's Mauricio Macri, and Italy's Matteo Renzi. Messina tweeted out pictures of him in the White House as Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama had their official portraits revealed.Kasselman credits Messina with the company hiring Ian Mair as Blockchain.com's head of U.S. policy and Giles Swan to run its European policy. Blockchain.com, which maintains U.S. headquarters in Miami, was also among a group of crypto companies that lobbied elements of the Digital Financial Assets Law, which would tighten oversight of the industry in California where many U.S.-based crypto firms are based. They ""offered amendments and feedback"" after the bill was introduced, Kasselman said. He said their ""main amendment focus"" was the bill's ""implementation period.""If signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the bill would go into effect in 2025 and require companies, such as digital-asset exchanges, to obtain licenses through the state's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.Kasselman also noted that Messina guided them on how best to lobby the European Parliament on its crypto regulation known as Markets in Crypto-assets rules.Kasselman said they won their latest battle with members of the parliament and their staff as the EU was deciding ""whether or not it would basically decide to make non custodial wallets illegal,"" he said. These types of digital wallets, which Blockchain.com promotes on its website, act effectively as an ultra secure crypto savings account.""It's core to our business belief that we should give people control of their assets and protect it from all other potential interference. And Jim really made us think through 'what is that argument, what's going to work in Brussels? What is that those members of parliament are worried about and how do we address these concerns?'"" Kasselman said. ""And as a result of his counsel, having worked with heads of state across Europe for years, we crafted, I don't want to call it a  campaign but sort of an argument that we went in and met with some of the ministers and won.""Swan, the company's head of European policy, met with the staff of EU commissioner of financial services, Mairead McGuinness, in May to discuss so-called transfer of funds regulation, according to a disclosure report. McGuiness has been critical of cryptocurrencies, and said digital assets were ""one of the newest ways to launder money"" in a tweet last year."

2022-09-26,"Eight states announced individual cease-and-desist orders against the crypto-lending platform Nexo.The filings state the company offered investors interest-earning accounts without first registering them as securities.The orders prevent Nexo from offering this product to residents until it meets the necessary registration requirements. Eight states announced on Monday they're bringing actions against the crypto-lending platform Nexo Group in connection with its unregistered, interest-bearing cryptocurrency product.State regulators in California, Kentucky, New York, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Washington and Vermont allege Nexo offered customers interest-earning accounts without first registering them as securities and providing necessary disclosures. Without access to these financial statements, state regulators contend investors cannot make informed investment decisions.The filings also alleged that Nexo misrepresented the accounts and suggested to investors that it is a licensed and registered platform. These interest-earning accounts, known as ""Earn Interest Product,"" allowed investors to deposit assets with Nexo in exchange for earning yields as high as 36% on their deposits, according to one of the filings.Nexo, however, says only one asset earns an interest rate at 36% and it does not advertise that yield in its marketing materials. The company says some of its most popular assets, like Bitcoin, only earn yields in the single digit percentages. The crackdown comes as a handful of recent crypto bankruptcies this year have left investors without access to their funds. Celsius, which offered similar interest-bearing accounts, filed for bankruptcy this summer after freezing customer funds in June. A third firm, Voyager, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July. The industry also saw billions of dollars wiped out during the weeks surrounding the implosion of cryptocurrency Terra USD and the failure of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.Nexo's terms and conditions said the company had the ability to deploy customer assets at its ""sole and absolute discretion.""According to the order filed in Vermont, ""investors have no part in selecting, monitoring, or reviewing the revenue-generating activities that Respondents utilize to earn this interest.""The Vermont order states that as of July 31, 2022, more than 93,318 U.S. residents had invested more than $800 million in these accounts.In response to more than 10,000 of its residents being affected, New York's Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency platform.""Cryptocurrency platforms are not exceptional; they must register to operate just like other investment platforms,"" James said in a statement. ""Nexo violated the law and investors' trust by falsely claiming that it is a licensed and registered platform. Nexo must stop its unlawful operations and take necessary action to protect its investors.""In February, the crypto-lending platform prevented U.S. investors who had not yet opened a Nexo account from investing in the Earn Interest Product or adding additional cryptocurrency into their accounts. The orders states filed further prevent Nexo from offering this product to residents until it meets the necessary registration requirements.In a statement, Nexo looked to differentiate itself from other platforms that have run into financial problems this year.""We have been working with U.S. federal and state regulators and understand their urge, given the current market turmoil and bankruptcies of companies offering similar products, to fulfill their mandates of investor protection by examining past behavior of providers of earn interest products,"" the company said in a statement.""As the recent months have clearly underlined, Nexo is a very different provider of earn interest products, as showcased by the fact that it did not engage in uncollateralized loans, had no exposure to LUNA/UST, did not have to be bailed out, or needed to resort to any withdrawal restrictions."""

Since 2019, there's been a question about ""virtual currency"" on the front page of the tax return, asking filers to disclose their taxable crypto activity.  However, there's still uncertainty about how to answer the question, explained Yu-Ting Wang, vice chair of the virtual currency task force for the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants.The organization submitted comments to the IRS about the question in late August, asking for revisions to the query and clearer instructions with examples before the agency finalizes the 2022 tax return, she said.  In 2021, Congress passed the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law, with a provision requiring annual tax reporting from digital currency brokers starting in 2023.The measure may bring in nearly $28 billion over a decade, according to a 2021 estimate from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.But tax professionals are still seeking guidance on the definition of ""broker"" to know which companies must comply, Wang said. Regardless of which companies report activity to the IRS, experts say crypto investors must be proactive.If you haven't reported cryptocurrency income on past tax returns, you should speak with a tax professional with digital currency expertise, Wang suggested.""It is much better to come forward and file an amendment than to let the IRS audit you — or potentially even worse, for not reporting crypto,"" Gordon said."

Brett Harrison, the U.S. president of the crypto exchange FTX, announced his resignation on Tuesday, with the company in the midst of a massive expansion effort.Harrison said on Twitter that he will be moving into an advisory role at the company and said he plans to remain in the industry.""I have deep gratitude for my experiences at FTX in the last year and a half,"" he wrote in a tweet.Harrison joined FTX, whose parent company is based in the Bahamas, in May 2021 after spending close to two years at Citadel Securities. Earlier in his career, he spent over seven years at Jane Street, the quantitative trading firm where FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried got his start in finance.As of early Tuesday, Harrison was listed as CEO of FTX US Derivates on the company's website. However, a company representative reached out to say that job is held by Zach Dexter. The website has since been updated to show Dexter with that role.Harrison concluded his Twitter thread by saying that he ""can't wait to share"" what he'll be doing next and, in the meantime, ""I'll be assisting Sam and the team with this transition to ensure FTX ends the year with all its characteristic momentum.""FTX, which was valued at $32 billion in a funding round earlier this year, is in talks with investors to raise up to $1 billion at a roughly flat valuation, CNBC reported last week, citing sources familiar with the matter. The company has been working to expand in the U.S., announcing Monday that it is set to buy Voyager Digital's assets billion for $1.4 billion after winning a bankruptcy auction.In addition to Voyager Digital, FTX has been seeking out distressed crypto assets in the U.S. as it tries to expand its market share during the so-called crypto winter. In July, FTX signed a deal that gives it the option to buy lender BlockFi.FTX received a cease-and-desist warning from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in August, instructing the company to stop ""misleading"" consumers about the insurance status of their funds.""We really didn't mean to mislead anyone, and we didn't suggest that FTX US itself, or that crypto/non-fiat assets, benefit from FDIC insurance,"" Harrison wrote on Twitter at the time."

""Since the pause, I have worked tirelessly to help the Company and its advisors put forward a viable plan for the Company to return coins to creditors in the fairest and most efficient way.""After the announcement was made, the company's cryptocurrency, the CEL token, dropped more than 7% in value, according to CoinMarketCap.As of May, Celsius was one of the largest players in the crypto lending space with more than $8 billion in loans to clients and almost $12 billion in assets under management. The firm would lend customers' crypto out to counterparties willing to pay sky-high interest rates to borrow it, and Celsius would then split some of that revenue with users.The structure came crashing down during an industry wide liquidity crunch, which resulted in Celsius pausing withdrawals in June. The collapse in the market also caused other companies to freeze assets and at least three to file for bankruptcy.As CNBC previously reported, the crypto company saw a range of internal missteps leading up to its recent turmoil, according to former employees and internal documents. Multiple employees painted a picture of risk-taking, disorganization and alleged market manipulation. Last week, an internal meeting leaked to CNBC discussed an early stage plan to turn Celsius' debt into a new cryptocurrency. According to the audio, Celsius will release ""wrapped tokens,"" which will serve as an IOU for customers. The tokens represent the ratio between what Celsius owes customers and what assets they have available. In a filing with the bankruptcy court on Tuesday, the Unsecured Creditors Committee wrote, ""...today's announcement is a positive step that will allow the Debtors, the Committee, and all other stakeholders to focus on moving these cases forward in a prompt and efficient manner.""The filing also stated the company's Chief Financial Officer, Chris Ferraro, would serve as Celsius' Chief Restructuring Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer.This news is developing.

2022-09-30,"FTX's winning bid for bankrupt crypto firm Voyager Digital includes a $51 million cash payment, with an additional $60 million in earnouts and incentives.The bulk of the offer is for the fair market value of Voyager's cryptocurrencies, which Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX will distribute pro rata to customers who move to FTX's platform.Voyager's bankruptcy followed the implosion of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. FTX's winning $1.4 billion bid for bankrupt crypto firm Voyager Digital was announced earlier this week, but court filings indicate that the cash paid for the firm itself is significantly lower — $51 million.The bulk of FTX's offer focused on Voyager's crypto holdings, which amounted to $1.31 billion. Those holdings will be distributed to eligible creditors on a pro rata basis, the filings say. related investing newsBuybacks are a great tool to reward shareholders — but the timing has to be right Zev Fima2 days agoSam Bankman-Fried, FTX's founder, has pursued an aggressive buying spree across the crypto industry, snapping up deeply discounted assets in the wake of defaults, bankruptcies, and market tumult.In the Voyager deal, FTX's consideration for non-crypto assets — the users, intellectual property, and structure of Voyager itself — constitutes a total of ""at least $111 million,"" filings show. Just $51 million of that is for Voyager's assets, intellectual property, and user base. The remaining $60 million consists of an accumulated $50 account credit for each Voyager user who successfully onboards with FTX and a $20 million ""earn out"" allowance. It was not immediately apparent, based on filings, who would benefit from an earnout, which is often used in acquisitions as a way to incentivize founders and management teams of the company being purchased.Voyager's most recent bankruptcy report indicated that the company held just shy of $900 million in crypto assets for customers, with another $456.44 million loaned out and $173.68 million held as collateral from borrowers. Voyager users who chose to migrate to FTX's platform would receive a pro rata distribution of Voyager assets, based on their portion of Voyager's overall holdings.Voyager's troubles emerged after the firm extended a loan valued at $670 million to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) in early 2022. When 3AC defaulted on its loan obligations in late June, it unleashed a financial cascade that pushed Voyager into bankruptcy and 3AC's founders into hiding. FTX's bid, if approved by creditors, would transfer Voyager's loan balances — excluding the 3AC loan, which was not part of the deal — to FTX and, by extension, to Bankman-Fried. The $51 million price tag for Voyager and its associated claims would represent a steep discount, given FTX's assumption of customer assets and loan balances.WATCH: Voyager Digital files for bankruptcy amid crypto lender solvency crisis"
2022-09-30,"As he was looking to buy Twitter, Elon Musk texted with tech executives including ex-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Oracle's Larry Ellison and venture investor Joe Lonsdale.Some of his friends offered advice, while others expressed interest in investing.Musk has since tried to back out of his agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion.  When Tesla CEO Elon Musk began accumulating shares in Twitter earlier this year, and later made a bid to buy the company, a number of luminaries from the tech and media worlds texted him with ideas, advice and offers of money.Musk has since tried to back out of his $44 billion acquisition offer, and Twitter is suing to force him to go through with it. The case is progressing through the Delaware Chancery Court, and on Thursday some of these text messages were published as evidence.Here's a rundown of the most interesting and eye-opening exchanges: Joe Lonsdale, tech investor, March 24: I love your 'Twitter algorithm should be open source' tweet -- I'm actually speaking to over 100 members of congress tomorrow at the GOP policy retreat and this is one of the ideas I'm pushing in for reigning in big tech. Now I can cite you so I'll sound less crazy myself ;) Our public squares need to not have arbitrary sketchy censorship""On Apr. 4, when it was revealed Musk had taken a 9.2% stake in the company, Lonsdale followed up: Excited to see the stake in Twitter - awesome. ""Back door man"" they are saying haha. Hope you're able to influence it. I bet you the board doesn't even get full reporting or see any report of the censorship decisions and the little cabals going on there, but they should - the lefties on the board likely want plausible deniability!He followed up again on Apr. 16: Haha even Governor DeSantis just called me now with ideas how to help you and outraged at that board and saying the public is rooting for you. let me know if you or somebody on your side wants to chat w him. Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey responded to the same tweet on March 24: Yes, a new platform is needed. It can't be a company. This is why I left.Elon Musk: OkMusk: What should it look like?Dorsey: I believe it must be an open source protocol, funded by a foundation of sorts that doesn't own the protocol, only advances it. A bit like what Signal has done. It can't have an advertising model. Otherwise you have surface area that governments and advertisers will try to influence and control. If it has a centralized entity behind it, it will be attacked. This isn't complicated work, it just has to be done right so it's resilient to what has happened to twitter. Will MacAskill, Oxford philosophy professor, March 29: Hey - I saw your poll on twitter about Twitter and free speech. I'm not sure if this is what's on your mind, but my collaborator [crypto investor and FTX CEO] Sam Bankman-Fried has for a while been potentially interested in purchasing it and then making it better for the world. If you want to talk to him about a possible joint effort in that direction, his number is [redacted] and he's on Signal.Musk: Does he have huge amounts of money?MacAskill, March 30: Depends on how you define ""huge""! He's worth $24B, and his early employees (with shared values) bump that to $30B. I asked about how much he could in principle contribute and he said ""~$1-3B would be easy `$3-8b I could do ~8-15b is maybe possible but would require financing.Bankman-Fried and Musk later communicated directly but the texts are mostly about meeting logistics. Later, other messages suggest Bankman-Fried was willing to put up as much as $5 billion to help finance Musk's takeover. Mathias Dopfner, CEO, Axel Springer, March 30: Why don't you buy Twitter? We run it for you. And establish a true platform of free speech. Would be a real contribution to democracy.Musk: Interesting idea.Dopfner: I'm serious. It's doable. Will be fun.On Apr. 6, Dopfner follwed up with more detailed ideas for the platform:#Status Quo: it is the de facto public town square, but it is a problem that it does not adhere to free speech principles. --> so the core product is pretty good but (i) it does not serve democracy and (ii) the current business model is a dead end as reflected by flat share price.#Goal: Make Twitter the global backbone of free speech, an open market place of ideas that truly complies with the spirit of the first amendment and shift the business model to a combination of ad-supported and paid to support quality#Game Plan:1.) ""Solve Free Speech""1a) Step 1: Make it censorship-FREE by radically reducing Terms of Services (now hundreds of pages) to the following: Twitter users agree to (1) use our service to send spam or scam users (2) Promote violence (3) Post illegal pornography1b) Step 2: Make Twitter censorship-RESISTANTEnsure censorship resistance by implementing measures that warrant that Twitter can't be censored long term, regardless of which government and management.How? Keep pushing projects at Twitter that have been working on developing a decentralized social network protocol (e.g., BlueSky) It's not easy but the backend must run on decentralized infrastructure, APIs should become open (back to the roots! Twitter started and became big with open APIs).Twitter would be one of many clients to post and consume content.Then create a marketplace for algorithms, e.g., if you're a snowflake and don't want content that offends you pick another algorithm.2.) ""Solve Share Price""Current state of the business:Twitter's ad revenues grow steadily and for the time being, are sufficient to fund operations.MAUs are flat, no structural growthShare price is flat, no confidence in the existing business model and/orThe message is cut off in the evidentiary documents at that point.

Step 1: Blame the platform for its users Step 2: Coordinated pressure campaign Step 3: Exodus of the Bluechecks Step 4: Deplatforming ""But it will not be easy. It will be a war.

You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the chain, which will cut out the vast majority of spam and bots. There is no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed.The second piece of the puzzle is a massive real-time database that keeps a copy of all blockchain messages in memory, as well as all message sent to or received by you, your followers and those you follow.Third piece is a twitter-like app on your phone that accessed the database in the cloud.This could be massiveKimbal Musk: I'd love to learn more.

I hate advertisementsThere are some good ads out there. The voting component of interested users (only vote if you want to) could vote on ads that add value. The advertisers would have to stake a much larger amount of tokens, but other than that there is no charge for the ads. It will bring out the creatives and the ads can be politically incorrect/art/activision/philanthropyVoting rights could also crowdsource kicking scammers out. It drives me crazy when I see people promoting the scam that you're giving away Bitcoin.

Not holding you to anything, but the deal is oversubscribed, so I have to reduce or kick out some participants.Ellison: A billion...or whatever you recommendMusk: Whatever works for you. I'd recommend maybe $2B or more. This has very high potential and I'd rather have you than anyone else.Ellison: I agree that it has huge potential...and it would be a lot of funOther notes of interest:Musk asked LinkedIn founder and investor Reid Hoffman if he wanted to take part in the take-private buyout.Hoffman put Musk in touch with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who apparently had a phone call with Musk.

The market chaos caused by the sell-off in U.K. government bonds should settle down following this week's emergency intervention by the Bank of England, said Ronald Wuijster, chief executive of APG Asset Management, one of the largest pension investors in the world.On Wednesday, the BOE stepped up to buy long-term-bonds or gilts over the next two weeks, in a bid to shore up financial stability.The move came after the pound fell to an all-time low against the dollar and government bond prices slumped, in reaction to the new U.K. government's fiscal policy announcements which included unfunded tax cuts.There was panic among some pension funds, and some of the bonds held within them quickly lost value.In order to top up the collateral on these bonds, some funds had to raise cash but due to the speed of this crisis, many funds were caught out and were forced to liquidate their next most liquid assets, long-term bonds or gilts, causing prices of bonds to fall even more.""The power of the central bank is sufficient, I think, to make it settle down,"" Wuijster told CNBC's Tanvir Gill at the Milken Asia Summit on Friday, adding there has been no panic for APG.

Our pension funds have interest rates swap positions as well.""""We do a lot of stress testing to see what could happen during this situation so we're well prepared, we're able to generate lots of liquidity to deal with a situation like that.""APG invests in gilts for its funds, but it does not have many gilt positions for liability hedging, Wuijster said. Liability hedging refers to reducing volatility in assets within funds such as pensions, and therefore minimizing risks to investment returns.Hedging is necessary to ensure pension plan beneficiaries get steady and guaranteed income. When asked if pension funds should reconsider using gilts, especially during times of economic uncertainty, Wuijster said that since a pension fund straddles a regular asset management and an insurance product, it is normal for half of the fund to be hedged using these instruments.A better solution for funds and investors to manage current macroeconomic risks is to be diversified, for example, by investing globally across a range of assets, Wuijster said.The CEO said it's not likely the same thing could happen to European bonds.Compared to the U.K., European policy makers have been more moderate in managing their energy crisis and inflation and have been raising interest rates more gradually, Wuijster says, adding that he does not expect a situation like the U.K. to occur in Europe. The U.K. government said the new tax policies would help boost growth at a time of rising inflation and soaring energy costs. But instead, they were accused of acting purely ideologically, with many economists predicting the cuts would fuel inflation and drive up government debt.""Mainly compensating a richer people is probably not the smartest idea,"" he said referring to the U.K. policies.""I think [the] worst hit are lower income people — by this energy prices and crisis — so I think the compensation that was announced in the U.K. is not very much welcomed by market.""The Bank of England said it would commence buying up to £5 billion (about $5.6 billion) of long-dated gilts, or those with a maturity of more than 20 years, on the secondary market from Wednesday until Oct. 14. — Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the interview took place at the Milken Asia Summit."
2022-10-03,"Reality TV superstar Kim Kardashian has agreed to pay $1.26 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission for promoting a crypto asset without disclosing that she had been paid to do so.The charges against the billionaire influencer stem from a post she made in June 2021 promoting EthereumMax's crypto asset, according to the SEC. The post included the hashtag ""#ad"" and a link to EthereumMax's website, which provided instructions on how to buy the digital tokens.Kardashian is cooperating with an ongoing investigation and has agreed not to promote any crypto securities for the next three years, according to an SEC press release. ""She remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter,"" a lawyer for Kardashian said in a statement.The case highlights an important lesson for investors: Be wary of trusting financial advice you come across on social media, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency.""This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn't mean that those investment products are right for all investors,"" Gary Gensler, chairman of the SEC, said in a news release.Although the SEC encourages investors to conduct their own research rather than ""rely on paid endorsements from artists, sports figures, or other icons,"" many young investors do turn to social media for financial advice.In fact, social media is millennials' and Gen Zs' second most popular source for financial advice behind friends and family, according to a 2021 CreditCards.com survey. And 52% of those who get financial advice from social media find the advice to be trustworthy, the survey says.""So few people fully understand crypto and its opportunities and risk,"" says Chen Arad, chief operating officer of Solidus Labs, a crypto-native risk monitoring and market surveillance company.""Many look for signals from celebrities and people they trust, and for an influential figure to promote something without disclosing it's basically an ad/sponsorship that was paid for, is simply misleading,"" Arad says.That's one reason why disclosures are so important. It's also crucial for investors to understand which assets make sense for their specific financial situation.""It's easy for those hyping cryptocurrency on social media, whether legitimately or not, to stoke interest with the promises of riches and flashy cars from trading,"" says James Royal, principal reporter at Bankrate. ""But the reality is that most traders end up losing big money, a fact that can be impossible to discern amid the glitz.""When it comes to making investment decisions, be sure to thoroughly research the asset you're considering. It may also make sense to work with a certified financial planner or other advisor, rather than relying on advice from social media.""Investment decisions should not be based solely on an endorsement by a promoter or other individual,"" the SEC warns.

2022-10-03,"The Treasury Department's Financial Stability Oversight Council released a new report on digital assets Monday.The report outlined several recommendations to keep cryptocurrency and digital assets trading from destabilizing U.S. financial security.The council pushed for legislation providing for tighter oversight of crypto. The Treasury Department warned Monday that unregulated cryptocurrencies could pose a risk to the U.S. financial system.The warning was a part of the first major public report released by the Treasury's Financial Stability Oversight Council on digital assets. The council identified digital or ""crypto"" assets such as stablecoins as well as lending and borrowing on the industry's trading platforms as an ""important emerging vulnerability."" related investing newsCrypto sees fifth consecutive week of outflows, with negative sentiment focused on bitcoinTanaya Macheel9 hours ago""The report concludes that crypto-asset activities could pose risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system and emphasizes the importance of appropriate regulation, including enforcement of existing laws,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. ""It is vital that government stakeholders collectively work to make progress on these recommendations.""The council first designated digital assets a priority area in February.  Global crypto-asset market capitalization reached a peak of roughly $3 trillion last November, comprising approximately 1% of global financial assets, according to the report. Though the impact is relatively small in the larger global financial system, digital financing is quickly gaining in popularity and is being manipulated by criminals for illegal gain, according to the report.Earlier this year, the Treasury Department issued a series of sanctions against Russian oligarchs, certain Russian banks and other organizations for using crypto assets to evade sanctions. In September, the agency blocked all property in possession or control of U.S. persons for 22 individuals and two entities that helped digitally finance Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency popular on the foreign exchange market, are also overwhelmingly used in speculative crypto-asset trading, Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said during a Monday FSOC meeting. Created for price stability, the price of the stablecoin is linked to flat currencies, commodities or other crypto assets. The group recommended legislation that empowers financial regulators to more vigorously oversee the industry as well as expanding bank exams to require federal and state agencies to look at services provided by crypto asset service companies.Formed after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, FSOC identifies emerging threats to the country's financial security and organizes a coordinated response across U.S. financial regulators. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FSOC is authorized to supervise and regulate nonbank financial companies, financial market utilities and payment, clearing or settlement activities to address possible vulnerabilities to financial stability.The report states that, to date, the FSOC has not used this authority to regulate the cryptocurrency market."
2022-10-03,"WHEN: Today, Monday, October 3rd, 2022    WHERE: CNBC's ""Squawk Box""Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC exclusive interview with SEC Chair Gary Gensler on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" (M-F, 6AM-9AM ET) today, Monday, October 3rd. Following is a link to video on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/10/03/sec-chair-gary-gensler-breaks-down-charges-against-kim-kardashian-over-a-crypto-promo.html.All references must be sourced to CNBC.ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Welcome back to ""Squawk."" We knew this morning the SEC charging Kim Kardashian for a post on her Instagram last year that endorsed a crypto asset security that was sold by EthereumMax without disclosing how much she was paid to promote it. The SEC says Kardashian has agreed to settle the charges, pay more than a million dollars in penalties and cooperate in an ongoing investigation. Joining us right now to talk about it all in exclusive interview is SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Gary, it's great to see you this morning. Help us understand why you brought this case and why you settled it.GARY GENSLER: Thank you, Andrew, it's good to be with you. Look, Congress passed a law many decades ago called the Securities Act and it was to protect the public and part of that law said that if you tout a stock, you need to disclose not only that you're getting paid, but also the amount so the source and the nature of those payments. And so this was to protect the public when folks and this law was passed in the 1930s, we've brought these types of cases over the decades but even in the last five years, with regard to crypto, it's really important that the public understand if somebody is touting a crypto security token that are they getting paid and how much are they getting paid? And we brought a case a number of years ago I think four, four years ago against Floyd Mayweather, against DJ Khaled, Steve Seagal, an actor, and others over the years. So, this is unfortunately it's another time that we brought a case like this.SORKIN: Chair Gensler, explain this though because I think that there's probably lots of questions in the public, in the influencer space, social media, about the distinctions that are being made here. Our understanding is at least from the posts that I've seen from Kim Kardashian, that seems to be the one in question, she had what's called a hash, hashtag ad under the post, which is something that a lot of influencers do to identify in fact that this is a promotional post. Why does that not count in this instance? Is it simply that she has to actually disclose the amount of money she's receiving and how does that differ for example from others who make similar posts who may own in fact different cryptos or other securities and promoting them? I'm thinking of Michael Saylor from MicroStrategy who has a huge stake in this has been out promoting on online and elsewhere. Or you can even talk about an Elon Musk who's talked about Dogecoin. They may not be being paid specifically cash to promote those things, but they have such a large investment in them that they have even more at stake, frankly.GENSLER: So let me talk about the core and I think why this is in the securities laws. You're, you're right that if you're advertising perfume, or you're advertising vacation homes or or anything else on the internet, there are various laws related to that. But these are the securities laws and those other laws might be appropriate to just say hashtag ad. But in the securities laws, Congress put in place that you have to disclose not only that you're getting paid but the amount, nature of it. And this was really to protect the investing public when somebody is touting a stock and whether that's a celebrity, an influencer or the like, and that's at the core of what this is about and we've brought these cases in the past.SORKIN: And so if you see an ad. Chair Gensler, if you were to see an ad, and I think we all did during the Superbowl, for example, with Matt Damon around crypto, I don't know if in the fine print of that ad it said how much he was being paid personally to promote that. Would that be something that would be required?GENSLER: I'm not gonna get into, Andrew, I understand the question. I'm not gonna get into any other specific circumstances, but it's always depends on the facts and the circumstances and the anti-touting provisions of the acts, 17(b) if you care to look it up.SORKIN: But I guess what's the distinction if you were to see an ad on television, an ad in print with a picture of an actor, an actress, an individual of any sort that's being paid anything, a model. Are they supposed to specifically disclose the amount of money that that model or actor or whomever is being paid?GENSLER: In this circumstance and let me say, I want to acknowledge Ms. Kardashian who has been cooperating and ongoing cooperation and we really appreciate that, but in this particular case, this is about an influencer, a high profile celebrity on their Instagram site, putting out a tout for this token, EthereumMax, which is a security we've determined and so those are the facts and circumstances here and it's important for the investing public to understand. Also, this is a highly speculative asset class and so when a celebrity or influence is touting it, it's important that the public understands that relationship and are they getting paid and how much they're getting paid on their Instagram site. That's what this was about. I hope that's helpful.SORKIN: Chair Gensler, we have a statement from from Ms. Kardashian's lawyer and I want to read it in a moment. But I want to ask you a separate question because a lot of people are focused on it this morning. You have determined in this case that EthereumMax is a security and that unto itself is interesting because there are questions about whether firms like Coinbase are exchanges, or whether they are broker dealers because of this issue of securities, and whether all of these things are now consistent or not.GENSLER: So there's about 10,000 tokens, crypto tokens, and the investing public is investing hoping for a better future. An agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, was put in place to protect the public in those circumstances when you're hoping for a better future, you're investing in something anticipating profits based upon the efforts of others. And that's what we found in this case with a EthereumMax. And to your question, I think and my predecessor thought this is well, that most of these tokens are in fact that that the public is investing, anticipating and hoping for profit based on somebody else's efforts. And yes, those various intermediaries are likely, need to register as either broker dealers or exchanges as you said.BECKY QUICK: Chair Gensler, we had Chairman Rostin Behnam from the CFTC on with us last week, and he made the point—GENSLER: Good man.QUICK: That the CFTC should be regulating all of these things. When you start to build up I guess some case law some examples of people who have agreed to settle with you like this, does that make the case more firm that the SEC would then be the place where these are all regulated?GENSLER: Look, our agency is an agency that oversees this basic bargain. When a group of entrepreneurs is raising money from the public and the public's anticipating a profit, they need disclosure full, fair and truthful disclosure. And that's the core bargain in our capital markets, you get to take the risk, but the person raising money or the persons raising money has to disclose various information to you. That seems how our capital markets work best. The SEC is very good at this and that's what we do and the case law is clear on this. The law is clear. I believe based on the facts and circumstances most of these tokens are securities.SORKIN: Chair Gensler, one more question on this and then I want to pivot the conversation for a momen.t I got an email this morning from the head of an advertising agency who said, please ask Chair Gensler to very explicitly explain what the rules are both for social media and for all sorts of other media as we make determinations about what kind of disclosure we have to make if in fact we're going to be promoting and this becomes more complicated whether it's a security or how you determine Bitcoin or some other crypto to be so for those advertising agency executives who are watching you right now, what would you tell them?GENSLER: I would tell them that they should read the securities laws and and 17(b) the anti-touting laws been on the books for a long time and they know, the advertising executive, with all respect, they know that if somebody is out promoting a security, they've got to disclose not only that they're being paid, but how much they're being paid. And particularly in crypto, if you thought about it mr. or ms. advertising executive, highly speculative asset, why is it that somebody's having that celebrity put something on their Instagram site? It's to to gain attention, bring people in, if somebody's paying them, that's an important piece of information and Congress is the one that laid out these laws.SORKIN: Chair Gensler, I want to pivot the conversation. I do also want to read a statement from Ms. Kardashians lawyer who says, ""Ms. Kardashian is pleased to have resolved this matter with the SEC. Kardashian fully cooperated with the SEC from the beginning and she remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter. She wanted to get this matter behind her to avoid a protracted dispute. The agreement should reach with the SEC allows her to do so so that she can move forward with her many different business pursuits."" And of course, we just heard you thank her for for settling this case. Let me ask you about the other big issue though that I think a lot of people in the markets are confronting this morning, which is what you think about Credit Suisse this morning. There's lots of speculation again, this is speculation that's online, in print and elsewhere. They don't have hashtag ad on them but how concerned are you about liquidity issues and the stability of the marketplace, and Credit Suisse specifically if you could?GENSLER: Well, let me step away from the specifics of any one company and I think your viewers understand I can't comment on any one company. But we're in uncertain times, a war continuing in Eastern Europe, various changes in the marketplace highly volatile, as we just saw last week in the United Kingdom and the Gilt market that's their sovereign debt markets, it's very volatile. And so in these times, it's really important that an agency like ours sort of redouble our efforts on resiliency, financial stability, and that's why we have numerous projects, ongoing projects to heighten the resiliency of our US Treasury market or our money market funds or our bond funds or something as boring as shortening the settlement cycle to one day from two days. So these are the projects we're working on. But for the investing public, we're going to make every effort to to lower those risks of financial stability risk where we can but these are ongoing projects that don't speak to your one company that I can't speak to.SORKIN: Well let me ask you then more specifically, in terms of the stability in the markets, systemic risk, people have talked about the possibility of a Lehman moment. Can you speak specifically though to this weekend, were you on the phone talking to folks about concerns in Europe at least broadly around banks in that region?GENSLER: I had nice conversations with my daughter whose birthday was this weekend but I think that's about all I can tell you about my weekend, Andrew.SORKIN: Okay, Chair Gensler, we appreciate you joining us this morning to talk to us about this settlement with Kim Kardashian and social media and we appreciate it and look forward to talking again very soon.GENSLER: Thank you.SORKIN: Thank you."
2022-10-07,"Visa is teaming up with global crypto exchange FTX to offer debit cards in 40 countries with a focus on Latin America, Asia and Europe.It's the payment giant's latest foray into the space with more than 70 crypto partnerships. Rival Mastercard has been on a similar deal spree.""Even though values have come down there's still steady interest in crypto,"" says Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu. Visa is betting that crypto investors still want to spend their digital currencies, even as prices plummet this year.The payments giant is teaming up with global exchange FTX to offer debit cards in 40 countries with a focus on Latin America, Asia and Europe. The cards, which are already available in the U.S., will link directly to a user's FTX cryptocurrency investing account. The move allows customers to spend digital currencies without moving those off an exchange, ""like you would with any bank account,"" according to Visa's CFO.related investing newsGet paid for doing nothing: What you should know about cash sweep accountsDarla Mercado, CFP®a day ago""Even though values have come down there's still steady interest in crypto,"" Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu told CNBC in a phone interview. ""We don't have a position as a company on what the value of cryptocurrency should be, or whether it's a good thing in the long run -- as long as people have things they want to buy, we want to facilitate it.""The deal comes as the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been cut in half from their all-time highs in November. Bitcoin was trading near $20,000 as of Friday morning, down 57% since January.It's Visa's latest foray into the space and adds to more than 70 crypto partnerships. The San Francisco-based company has already joined forces with FTX's competitors Coinbase and Binance. Rival Mastercard has been on a similar spree, also partnering with Coinbase on NFTs and Bakkt to let banks and merchants in its network offer crypto-related services. American Express has said it's exploring using its cards and network with stablecoins, which are pegged to the price of a dollar or another fiat currency. But the CEO said earlier this year that consumers should not expect to see an AmEx crypto-linked card ""anytime soon."" FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledged some irony in these partnerships. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were first designed to get around banks and intermediaries. But banks and payment companies are suddenly embracing the technology as cryptocurrencies go mainstream, and help drive payment volume.""It's a technology that we absolutely see disrupting traditional payment networks,"" Bankman-Fried told CNBC in a phone call. ""There's a decision you have to make as a traditional payments company: do you want to lean into this or do you want to fight against it? I respect the fact that many of them are leaning into it.""Bankman-Fried also said enabling card payments was key to the market's growth beyond being a speculative asset, or to some, a store of value. The Visa partnership makes it easier for merchants to accept cryptocurrencies without setting up proprietary technology. Visa and FTX convert it on the back end. As Prabhu put it ""everything is done behind the scenes.""Both executives said the biggest opportunity is in emerging markets, where currency volatility and inflation make access to digital assets more attractive than they might look in the U.S. Bankman-Fried called out Turkey and Argentina, where inflation has topped 83% and 78%, respectively.""Many of these things like are potentially cool and valuable in the United States but more so when you look globally,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""That's where you'll find places with really poor alternatives for payment rails and huge demand for something better.""Visa's Prabhu pointed to demand for stablecoins, which are either linked to the price of a dollar or another fiat currency. The CFO said they often see people opening accounts to hold crypto ""and use those like they would a bank account.""Despite mainstream adoption and Fortune 500 companies like Visa embracing the technology, the industry has had some high-profile blowups this year. Lenders Celsius and Voyager filed for bankruptcy after freezing withdrawals, and the failure of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital resulted in billions wiped out of the markets in a matter of days. Visa's CFO said so far, the company has been able to avoid exposure to a crypto crisis.""Nothing is risk-free, you do the best you can — so far, the risk controls have worked well and our due diligence has worked well,"" Prabhu said. ""By and large we've been enabling innovation while protecting the Visa brand."""
2022-10-07,"The crypto market fell with stocks after the highly anticipated jobs report showed the labor market is still tight and could keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise rates aggressively.The price of bitcoin fell 3.3% to $19,380.74, according to Coin Metrics. Ether fell 2.7% to $1,322.40.On Friday the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in September, compared with the Dow Jones estimate of 275,000, and that the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% from 3.7% in the previous month. Loading chart... ""The jobs report points to no change of tune on the horizon for the Fed, so we continue to expect firm interest rates which also adds pressure to crypto markets,"" said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management.  Cryptocurrencies' correlation with stocks has weakened in recent weeks but remains high.""Crypto looks to be at an important technical juncture here where it looks like it's trying to carve out a bottom, but feeling heavy,"" he added. ""I still think it, more likely than not, breaks to the downside given rising interest rates and risk-off sentiment, but so far it's a surprising effort to hold the line.""The market has been in a good-news-is-bad-news holding pattern with the Federal Reserve laser focused on bring down inflation. While the new data shows strength in the U.S. economy, that could make the Fed more likely to continue with its aggressive rate hiking plan (whereas investors are hoping for a pause or a pivot), which puts pressure on stocks and weighs on crypto.""Crypto has been the hardest hit by rate hike fears this year,"" said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. ""It makes sense – many crypto projects don't have cashflows, so people invest in them for what they could be, not necessarily what value they're providing right now. When rates rise, the future value of a dollar falls.""  Cox also highlighted the resilience of crypto assets in the second half of the year, noting that while stocks have revisited new lows with the spike in bond yields, bitcoin and ether haven't done the same. Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range of between $18,000 and $25,000 since falling to its lows of the year in June.""To me, that's progress in this bear market,"" Cox said. ""Crypto prices could be telling us the rate anxiety could be at a turning point. Crypto's strength is also a good indicator of frothiness in the market. It seems like the brutal growth selloff has finally washed out all the weak hands.""""Bitcoin is also far below its highs too,"" she added. ""But stability is a step in the right direction."""
2022-10-07,"Binance said a cross-chain bridge linking with its BNB Chain was targeted, enabling hackers to move BNB tokens off the network.In total, hackers withdrew 2 million BNB tokens — about $570 million at current prices — from BNB Chain said in a blog post on Friday.An earlier estimate from the company placed the total amount withdrawn in a range of $100 million to $110 million.The value of BNB sank more than 3% Friday morning to $285.36 a coin, according to CoinMarketCap data. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance temporarily suspended its blockchain network after hackers made off with around $570 million worth of its BNB token.Binance said late Thursday a cross-chain bridge linking with its BNB Chain was targeted, enabling hackers to move BNB tokens off the network. So-called cross-chain bridges are tools that allow the transfer of tokens from one blockchain to another.The company said it had worked with network validators — entities or individuals who confirm transactions on the blockchain — to pause creation of new blocks on BSC, suspending all transaction processing while a team of developers investigates the breach.Binance is the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume.""An exploit on a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, resulted in extra BNB. We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC,"" Changpeng Zhao, Binance's CEO, said in a tweet Thursday evening.""The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.""BNB Chain has since resumed operations. In total, hackers drained 2 million BNB tokens — about $570 million at current prices — from the network, Binance's BNB Chain said in a blog post on Friday.The hack was caused by a bug in the bridge's smart contract that allowed hackers to forge transactions and send money back to their crypto wallet, according to crypto security firm Immunefi. Smart contracts are pieces of code on the blockchain that allow agreements to execute automatically without human intervention.""As with many bridge designs, there is one central point that holds most of the funds that are moving through the bridge,"" Adrian Hetman, tech lead of the triaging team at Immunefi, told CNBC.""Ultimately, the Bridge was tricked into giving funds from that contract.""The value of BNB sank more than 3% Friday morning to $285.36 a coin, according to CoinMarketCap data.An earlier estimate from the company placed the total amount withdrawn in a range of $100 million to $110 million. The company also said it managed to freeze $7 million of funds with the help of its security partners.A Binance spokesperson told CNBC the company coordinated with BNB Chain validators to enact an upgrade. That meant that most of the funds remained in the exploiter's crypto wallet, while about $100 million was ""unrecovered.""BNB Chain has 26 active validators at present and 44 in total in different time zones, the spokesperson added.BNB Chain, originally known as Binance Chain, was first developed by Binance in 2019. Like other blockchains, it features a native token, called BNB, that can be traded or used in games and other applications.It is the latest in a series of major hacks targeting cross-chain bridges, with instances of sloppy engineering making them a prime target for cybercriminals.A total of around $1.4 billion has been lost to breaches on cross-chain bridges since the start of 2022, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.The crypto industry has had a rough year, with roughly $2 trillion in value being erased since the peak of a blistering rally from 2020 to 2021. The implosion of $60 billion blockchain venture Terra and a worsening macroeconomic environment have severely impacted market sentiment."
2022-10-11,"Rather than directly accessing the bitcoin protocol, the vast majority of miners today work through an intermediary protocol called Stratum.On Tuesday, a coalition of developers is releasing Stratum V2 under an open-source license for the industry to test. Software used in bitcoin mining just got its first upgrade since late 2012, and a coalition of companies including payments giant Block (formerly Square) is trying to help push the open-source protocol forward to become an industry standard.The move could help open bitcoin mining to more participants by supporting lower-quality internet connections, as well as improving security so miners get properly compensated for their work.Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work mining model, meaning that miners around the world run high-powered computers to create new bitcoin and validate transactions. Mining requires professional-grade equipment, some technical know-how, a lot of electricity and a special kind of software. Rather than directly accessing the bitcoin protocol, the vast majority of miners today work through an intermediary protocol called Stratum, which facilitates communication between the bitcoin network, miners, and the mining pools that combine the hashing power of thousands of miners all over the world.Miners use Stratum to submit their work and to collect a reward if they successfully complete a new block of transactions.On Tuesday, a coalition of bitcoin developers is releasing version 2 of Stratum under an open-source license for the mining industry to evaluate and test.It will take some work to convince the mining industry to adopt the new protocol, so Spiral — a subsidiary of Jack Dorsey's payments company Block (formerly Square) — is teaming up with bitcoin mining company Braiins to launch a group to test and fine-tune the open-source software before they push mass adoption. Steve Lee, the lead at Spiral, tells CNBC there are several significant benefits to the upgrade, including cutting down on the use of data.Currently, it is common for each mining rig in a large farm to directly connect to a pool. This setup wastes a lot of energy. Lee says that Stratum V2 supports a proxy that aggregates all the connections and only establishes one connection with the pool.The process of sending that data is also changing to a more efficient method. ""All told, much less data needs to be transmitted between miners and pools, and this could help miners in remote regions of the world with poor internet,"" noted Lee.The upgrade is designed to improve security, as well. Today, it is possible to steal hash rate from a miner, which can lead to some miners losing money. Hash rate is a term for the collective computing power of the bitcoin network. To resolve this, Lee says Stratum V2 introduces a standard security mechanism with authentication and encryption between miners and pools.The version being released Tuesday is for initial testing, and in early November, a more robust version will come out that supports additional functionality, including job negotiation — a ""feature that represents a historic shift in the censorship-resistant mechanics of bitcoin mining by replacing a pool’s responsibility of assigning work to miners with the ability for miners to select their own work,"" according to a joint statement released by Spiral and Braiins.There are orders of magnitude more miners than pools, so if miners select transactions it is far more decentralized than just a handful of pools, Lee explained.""Working for industrywide adoption of the upgraded Stratum protocol is one of the most important developments in improving the decentralization and censorship resistance of bitcoin’s architecture,"" Lee said.As for timing, the pilot and integration testing will happen this fall, and next year, the upgraded protocol will likely see greater adoption once miners and pools are confident it is working well.""I'd anticipate a gradual increase in hash rate in 2023,"" Lee told CNBC. ""Reaching 10% hash rate by the end of 2023 would be a great success,"" continued Lee.Lee added that it will likely take several years to see the latest version of Stratum replace the original.“Miners know the benefits of upgrading to Stratum V2 very well, but pushing the entire mining industry over some of the remaining development and adoption hurdles is a big task,"" said Jan Capek, co-founder of Braiins.""Universal standards for running and building Stratum V2 and the efforts of this working group to push the industry forward will provide the momentum bitcoin needs to finally upgrade from a version of its mining protocol that was built a decade ago,” continued Capek.Similar to the Lightning Network, which is a technology built on top of bitcoin's base layer to make payments more efficient, there will be different implementations of Stratum V2. However, the open-source version released Tuesday will make it easier to collectively test out the technology. It will also ensure that the various projects can interact with one another. Tuesday's announcement is part of Block's larger push into the bitcoin mining industry.On the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami in April, digital assets infrastructure company Blockstream and Block announced that they were breaking ground on a solar- and battery-powered bitcoin mine in Texas that uses solar and storage technology from Tesla.Tesla's 3.8 megawatt solar PV array and 12 megawatt-hour Megapack will power the facility.Block is also independently working on a project to make bitcoin mining more distributed and efficient.The idea of making the mining process more accessible has to do with more than just creating new bitcoin, according to Block's general manager for hardware, Thomas Templeton. Instead, he says the company sees it as a long-term need for a future that is fully decentralized and permissionless.""Mining needs to be more distributed,"" Dorsey wrote in a tweet in October, when he first floated the idea. ""The more decentralized this is, the more resilient the bitcoin network becomes.""Toward that end, the company is solving one major barrier to entry: Mining rigs are hard to find, expensive and delivery can be unpredictable. Block says it is open to making a new ASIC, which is the specialized gear used to mine for bitcoin.The project is being incubated within Block's hardware team, which is beginning to build out a core engineering team of system, ASIC and software designers led by Afshin Rezayee."

U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase received a key regulatory license in Singapore as it ramps up expansion overseas, the company said on Tuesday.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country's central bank, granted Coinbase an in-principle approval to provide regulated digital token products and services in the island state.Coinbase's regulatory approval comes as the crypto market remains under pressure. Around $2 trillion has been wiped off the value of the market with major tokens like bitcoin and ether in the red this year.Contagion from the collapse of major projects and bankruptcies across firms has spread across the industry. Coinbase announced in June it was laying off 18% off its workforce. Still, the U.S. exchange has pushed ahead with international expansion and is seeking to hire people across new markets in Europe.Coinbase has been making steady investments in Singapore. Last year, the company announced that Singapore will one of its tech development hub. The island state is also the hub for Coinbase's business focused on institutional investors in the Asia-Pacific region.""Gaining this in-principle approval from MAS is an important step, as we plan to launch our full suite of retail, institutional and ecosystem products,"" Coinbase said in a blog post on Tuesday.MAS has given such approvals to 15 different firms as Singapore looks to build its reputation as a regulated global hub for the cryptocurrency industry.While the central banks has warned about the ""speculative"" risks of cryptocurrencies and has looked to tighten rules around trading for retail investors, it is still trying to attract businesses to set up shop in Singapore."
2022-10-11,"Bitcoin on Tuesday floated at the $19,000 level, where it has remained for about a month with some momentary breaks.The largest cryptocurrency by market cap, whose volatility has been uncharacteristically low in recent weeks, was down by 1.1% at $19,002.70, according to Coin Metrics. Ether fell 2% to $1,282.17.Crypto prices remain depressed, with bitcoin off its all-time high from nearly a year ago by more than 70%. Chart analysts have been looking for the cryptocurrency to break lower – to retest its June lows of about $17,000 and find a new bottom, potentially as low as $10,000 – if it fails to hold at $19,000. Slight breaks below that level haven't proved to be meaningful, however. Loading chart...

Prices held steady even after two big announcements signaling that institutional acceptance and adoption of crypto continues to build in spite of the bear market. On Tuesday, Google announced it would explore using Coinbase's service for storing and trading cryptocurrencies. On top of that, BNY Mellon said Tuesday that it will add cryptocurrencies to the various assets it holds as a custody manager.""These large companies believe in the potential of digital assets and Web3,"" said Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer. ""It takes time to build, but these companies are taking a long-term view to bulk up their capabilities to make sure they won't be behind in 3-5 years.""In the past month, Nasdaq also launched crypto custody for institutions and Franklin Templeton, Betterment, Société Générale and other wealth managers have made forays into crypto.A year ago, news like that might have moved the crypto market, but prices are largely macro driven now.Still, prices will likely be stuck for some time. The Federal Reserve pushed crypto into the well with its rate-hiking plan, and investors say it's on the central bank to pull it back out."
2022-10-13,"El Salvador has lost around $60 million on its bitcoin bet one year into a nationwide crypto experiment.The use of bitcoin in El Salvador appears to be low amid the market volatility.The country faces plummeting economic growth and a high deficit. It has been more than a year since El Salvador made history by becoming the first country to make bitcoin legal tender, and so far, 37-year-old resident Edgardo Acevedo has found the nationwide crypto experiment to be relatively anticlimactic.""I don't think anything has changed, except that the country is more recognized than before, but the economic life of Salvadorans remains the same or worse than a few years ago,"" said Acevedo, a development engineer working in the capital city of San Salvador.related investing newsMorgan Stanley sees a sign that points to a top in bitcoinTanaya Macheel12 hours agoAcevedo, who is also known by the pseudonym Ishi Kawa, tells CNBC that while bitcoin has become a topic of conversation, adoption remains low, and he has personally found that there are very few businesses that accept the world's biggest cryptocurrency — and even fewer Salvadorans who wish to pay in the digital token.""What has improved is the issue of violence and crime, but economically, I can say that nothing has changed,"" he said.It has been a rocky time, with the project not living up to the grand promises made by the country's popular and outspoken president Nayib Bukele.The use of bitcoin in El Salvador appears to be low, as the currency has lost about 60% of its value since the experiment started and the country still faces plummeting economic growth and a high deficit. El Salvador's debt-to-GDP ratio — a key metric used to compare what a country owes with what it generates — is set to hit nearly 87% this year, stoking fears that the nation isn't equipped to settle its loan obligations.Data from Bloomberg Economics shows that El Salvador tops its ranking of emerging market countries that are vulnerable to a debt default. Even as it retires some of its outstanding debts, the country's domestic and multilateral loan obligations pose a real threat, in part because the world's biggest lenders aren't too keen to give cash to a country betting its future on one of the most volatile assets on the planet.Pair these economic woes with a renewed war on gang violence and the country is barreling toward uncertainty.""The government claims the developments as a success, but most local commentators and international watchers are underwhelmed,"" Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights, told CNBC. When El Salvador's Bitcoin Law came into effect Sept. 7, 2021, Jaime Garcia was hopeful that it would fix a few big problems with the way that Salvadorans send, receive and spend money.As part of the law, prices are now sometimes listed in bitcoin, tax contributions can be paid with the digital currency, and exchanges in bitcoin will not be subject to capital gains tax. But crucially, Bukele promoted the law as a way to expand financial inclusion — which is no small thing for a country where approximately 70% of the population does not have access to traditional financial services, according to the Bitcoin Law.To help facilitate national adoption, El Salvador launched a virtual wallet called ""chivo"" (Salvadoran slang for ""cool"") that offers no-fee transactions, allows for quick cross-border payments, and requires only a mobile phone plus an internet connection. It aimed to bring users onboard quickly, both to scale bitcoin adoption and to offer a convenient onramp for those who had never been a part of the banking system.Bukele tweeted in January that about 60% of the population, or 4 million people, used the chivo app, and more Salvadorans have chivo wallets than traditional bank accounts, according to a Sept. 20 research note from Deutsche Bank. Still, only 64.6% of the country has access to a mobile phone with internet, that note says.But a report published in April by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research showed that only 20% of those who downloaded the wallet continued to use it after spending the $30 bonus. The research was based upon a ""nationally representative survey"" involving 1,800 households.Garcia, who lives in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, fled El Salvador when he was 11 after rebels bombed his house, but he keeps in close touch with family and friends who stayed behind — and he sometimes sends money back home, too.""There are pockets where bitcoin is popular, like in El Zonte, but it's clear that adoption is not massive,"" said Garcia.""Big chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and most merchants at a mall will accept bitcoin — but are people using it? Not too much locally,"" he said. ""It's mostly tourists using bitcoin.""A survey by the El Salvador-based El Instituto de Opinion Publica, a public opinion think tank, found that 7 in 10 Salvadorans do not think the Bitcoin Law has benefited their family economy.Another survey by the institute found that 76 out of 100 small and medium-size enterprises in El Salvador do not accept bitcoin payments.""Bitcoin's first year in effect has transcended from a commercial expectation to an irrelevant topic for traders,"" said Laura Andrade, director of El Salvador's Universidad Centroamericana, according to a CNBC translation of her Spanish-language comments.Andrade said many large corporations are still advertising that they're taking payments in bitcoin but are making excuses to not accept the cryptocurrency including saying their system does not work or the bitcoin wallet is out of service.""The foregoing is evidence that this cryptocurrency, in reality, never had penetration in national commerce,"" Andrade said.""There seems to be evidence that most people used it primarily to get the free money from the government but have not used it on an ongoing basis given volatility and fees,"" Ziemba said.Meanwhile, those who did use the government's crypto wallet reportedly had technical problems with the app. Other Salvadorans fell prey to schemes involving identity theft, in which hackers used their national ID number to open a chivo e-wallet, in order to claim the free $30 worth of bitcoin offered by the government as an incentive to join.A survey published in March by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of El Salvador found that 86% of businesses have never made a sale in bitcoin, and only 20% of businesses take bitcoin, despite the Law's mandate that all merchants accept the cryptocurrency.""They gave people the wallets, they forced businesses to accept them, but essentially, in my opinion, it's a big nothing burger,"" said Frank Muci, a policy fellow at the London School of Economics, who has experience advising governments in Latin America. ""Nobody really uses the app to pay in bitcoin. People that do use it, mostly use it for dollars.""The experiment also involved building a nationwide infrastructure of bitcoin ATMs, but they're too far away for many people to use.Another hope for the chivo wallet was that it would help save hundreds of millions of dollars in remittance fees. Remittances, or money sent home by migrants, account for more than 20% of El Salvador's gross domestic product, and some households receive over 60% of their income from this source alone. Incumbent services can charge 10% or more in fees for those international transfers, which can sometimes take days to arrive and require a physical pickup.But in 2022, recent data shows that only 1.6% of remittances were sent to El Salvador via digital wallets. According to the Deutsche Bank report from September, part of the reason bitcoin transfers haven't caught on has to do with the complications of buying and selling bitcoin for dollars. The report notes that ""people who send and receive remittances frequently use informal brokers to convert local currency to and from bitcoin"" and extremely volatile prices make buying and selling the cryptocurrency a complex task requiring technical know-how.""This is a new money, a new way of doing things for a population that is very comfortable with dollars. This is a population that is largely unbanked and would rather deal with hard cash that they can see and feel,"" Garcia said.Miles Suter, the crypto product lead at Cash App, told CNBC on a panel at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York that the government's 90-day rollout of the chivo wallet and nationwide adoption of bitcoin was ""rushed"" and that there are still a lot of problems.""You shouldn't mandate the acceptance of a specific currency,"" said Suter, who spent six months in El Salvador in the runup to the passing of the Bitcoin Law. However, Suter added that the media perception is worse than how things are actually going on the ground.""I saw and experienced lives being changed by having access to a new emerging monetary standard,"" he said. Well before Bukele wagered that bitcoin would bandage over longstanding economic vulnerabilities, the country was in a lot of trouble.The World Bank projects that the Salvadoran economy will grow by 2.9% this year and 1.9% in 2023, down from 10.7% in 2021. But that growth itself was a bounce-back from an 8.6% contraction in 2020.Its debt-to-GDP ratio is almost 90%, and its debt is expensive at around 5% per year versus 1.5% in the U.S. The country also has a massive deficit — with no plans to reduce it, whether through tax hikes or by substantially cutting spending.In a research note from JPMorgan, analysts warn that El Salvador's eurobonds have entered ""distressed territory"" in the last year, and S&P Global data reportedly shows that the cost to insure against a sovereign debt default is hitting multiyear highs.Both JPMorgan and the International Monetary Fund warn the country is on an unsustainable path, with gross financing needs set to surpass 15% of GDP from 2022 forward — and public debt on track to hit 96% of GDP by 2026 under current policies.El Salvador faces a heavy mix of multilateral and domestic debts, including imminent debt repayment deadlines in the billions of dollars, such as an $800 million eurobond that matures in January.""The domestic debt is very large, relatively short duration and needs to be rolled over frequently,"" said Muci, who previously worked at the Growth Lab at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.El Salvador has been trying since early 2021 to secure a $1.3 billion loan from the IMF — an effort that appears to have soured over Bukele's refusal to heed the organization's advice to ditch bitcoin as legal tender.Rating agencies, including Fitch, have knocked down El Salvador's credit score, citing the uncertainty of the country's financial future given the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. That means that it's now even more expensive for Bukele to borrow much-needed cash.Beyond the fact that global lenders don't want to throw money at a country that is spending millions in tax dollars on a cryptocurrency whose price is prone to extreme volatility, the IMF's largest shareholder, the U.S., is targeting Salvadoran officials as part of wider international sanctions against ""corrupt actors.""The president's efforts to consolidate power have also driven up this risk premium for global lenders.Bukele's New Ideas party has control over the country's Legislative Assembly. In 2021, the new assembly came under fire after it ousted the attorney general and top judges. The move prompted the U.S. Agency for International Development to pull aid from El Salvador's national police and a public information institute and reroute the funds to civil society groups.Additionally, El Salvador can't print cash to shore up its finances. El Salvador ditched its local currency, the colon, in favor of the U.S. dollar. Only the Federal Reserve can print more dollars. Meanwhile, its other national currency, bitcoin, is revered for the fact that it, too, is impossible to mint out of thin air.""One of the big issues has been the fact that the bitcoin gimmick has distracted from the fiscal and economic challenges of the country and made it more difficult for the country to access IFI lending and preferential terms,"" Ziemba said.Ziemba added that there have been some swaps with major crypto firms that allowed the country to raise cash to pay off the debt due this year, and perhaps early next year, but the long-term debt sustainability remains a challenge.""They've spooked the bejesus out of financial markets and the IMF,"" said Muci, who tells CNBC that nobody wants to lend money to Bukele unless it's at ""eye-gouging rates"" of 20% to 25%.""The country is sleepwalking into a debt default,"" Muci said. On the day the Bitcoin Law took effect, Bukele revealed that the country had begun to add bitcoin to government coffers. Since then, the price of the cryptocurrency has plunged more than 60%, stoked by rising interest rates and failed projects and bankruptcies in the industry.The government has an unrealized paper loss on bitcoin of around $60 million, according to sources, including bitcoin company Coinkite, which track the president's public announcements of bitcoin purchases. None of these losses are locked in until the country exits its bitcoin position.In aggregate, the entire experiment and all its associated costs have only set the government back around $375 million, according to estimates. That's not nothing — especially considering the fact that El Salvador has $7.7 billion of bonds outstanding — but to an economy of $29 billion, it is comparatively small.El Salvador's millennial, tech-savvy president — who once touted himself as the ""world's coolest dictator"" on his Twitter bio — has tethered his political fate to the country's crypto gamble, so he has a very big incentive to make it work in the long run and to pay off the country's debt in the interim. Bukele faces reelection for another five-year presidential term in 2024.At least El Salvador's big bitcoin gamble has been a win in terms of attracting bitcoin tourists.The tourism industry is up 30% since the Bitcoin Law took effect, according to official government estimates. The country's tourism minister also notes that 60% of tourists now come from the U.S.The bitcoin experiment hasn't hurt the president's popularity either. Bukele's approval ratings are north of 85% — thanks in large part to his tough-on-crime approach to leading. That's no small thing to a country that was more dangerous per capita than Afghanistan five years ago.Suter said the project has also introduced many locals to the concept of savings, noting that before the Bitcoin Law, much of the population didn't have a way to digitally hold their money and transact among one another.""It was all cash — and the cash that you earned that week, you typically spent it, because there wasn't much ability to dream of growing it through investment."" The president upped the ante in November when he announced plans to build a ""Bitcoin City"" next door to the Conchagua volcano in southeastern El Salvador. The bitcoin-funded city would offer significant tax relief, and geothermal energy rolling off the adjacent volcano would power bitcoin miners.But now, Bitcoin City is on hold, as is the $1 billion bitcoin bond sale, which was initially put on ice in March because of unfavorable market conditions.""Ultimately, El Salvador's problems are just tangential to currency,"" Muci said.""The plane is gonna crash eventually, if they don't change things,"" he said — ""if they don't raise taxes, cut spending, start being much more disciplined, convincing markets that they're sustainable.""""Bitcoin doesn't solve any of El Salvador's important economic problems,"" he added."
2022-10-13,"Cryptocurrency prices rebounded Thursday after sliding to new October lows following the release of a key U.S. inflation reading that came in hotter than expected.The price of bitcoin was last higher by 1.3% at $19,388.89 and ether lost 0.7% to trade at $1,289.20, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day they fell as low as $18,201.00 and $1,192.80, respectively.Bitcoin dropped below $19,000 early on Thursday as investors anxiously awaited the latest read on the consumer price index. It fell more sharply after the report came in, showing a slightly larger-than-expected increase in inflation, despite the aggressive rate hikes the Federal Reserve has brought into play to combat rising prices.Cryptocurrencies have been trading mostly sideways since the end of August, with bitcoin hovering within $19,000. That's been a key level to watch for analysts, who say a break below it could lead to new lows below those hit in June, when bitcoin fell below $17,800 and ether fell under $900.""Crypto markets are still overwhelmingly driven by macro. Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range since June,"" said Michael Rinko, venture associate at AscendEx. ""However, today's CPI print may threaten to break this range to the downside.""

Still, Steve McClurg, chief investment officer at Valkyrie investments, said the market's initial reaction was to be expected with high inflation suggesting to investors that the Fed will continue with its planned rate hikes.""Given what we know about Powell's stated goal right now, and the fact that we are in what appears to be a deep recession, it makes sense that we'd be down today,"" he said. ""We firmly believe that markets still have not yet reached a bottom, and that there's still likely another 10% to 15% leg down for digital assets, and even more for equities,"" he added.Elsewhere in the market, bond yields moved higher following the inflation report, which put initially put pressure on crypto equities. Rising rates make future profits, like those promised by growth companies, less attractive."
2022-10-13,"Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase slid sharply following the release of a key inflation indicator but mostly rebounded later in the day.Inflation increased in September, leading markets to expect the Fed could institute consecutive rate hikes in November and December.The news caused investors to sell riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks. Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase fell 1% on Thursday after the Consumer Price Index showed inflation continued to increase in September beyond Wall Street's expectations. The stock had fallen as much as 12.7% earlier in the day.Bitcoin and other stocks tied to the success of crypto felt the pain, too. Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital Microstrategy and Block (formerly Square) all saw shares drop Thursday morning, though they rebounded later, even turning positive.The broader markets were also trading lower on the fresh inflation read from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But crypto stocks saw steeper falls than major indices like the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, which also fell on the inflation data but turned positive later in the day.In recent months, an increase in inflation has been followed by volatility on Wall Street. That's because more disappointing news on inflation means the Federal Reserve may implement larger interest rate hikes, further slowing economic growth.Thursday's CPI data likely cements consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate hikes in November and December. That diminishes investor's appetites for riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies and crypto-related equities."

In an interview with Politico's Morning Money this week, however, the founder of the global cryptocurrency exchange FTX called it a ""dumb quote.""""I think my messaging was sort of sloppy and inconsistent in some cases,"" said Bankman-Fried, who also founded trading firm Alameda Research.Instead, Bankman-Fried has reportedly invested around $40 million in political action committees and campaigns this year in the runup to midterm elections, with most of that money going to Democratic candidates. The FTX CEO has been the driving force behind the Protect Our Future PAC, which has raised more than $28 million thus far — and could move the needle in upcoming House races.But for now, Bankman-Fried is hitting pause on his political campaign spending, telling Politico, ""At some point, when you've given your message to voters, there's just not a whole lot more you can do.""""You can spend more time on it, and more messaging, more money, more anything else, [but] you're not accomplishing anything more,"" the FTX CEO told Politico.The crypto market has tanked since Bankman-Fried first pledged to spend hundreds of millions of dollars earlier this year.Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, is down more than 50% in the last six months and more than 70% since hitting its all-time high in November 2021. Meanwhile, the crypto market as a whole, which less than a year ago had a market cap of around $3 trillion, is less than $1 trillion today.For his part, Bankman-Fried has been spending a lot of money the last few months to prop up the digital asset industry during the 2022 crypto winter. The quant trader-turned-CEO has bailed out multiple crypto firms to protect against a wider contagion effect across the sector, and Bankman-Fried told CNBC in September that FTX still has another $1 billion to deploy.Bankman-Fried was also interested in helping to fund Elon Musk's proposed takeover of Twitter, according to personal text messages that were released recently as part of Twitter's lawsuit to force Musk to complete the deal. At one point, the billionaire was ready to commit up to $8 billion, according to a message to Musk from Bankman-Fried's ""collaborator,"" professor Will MacAskill. However, he never made a formal offer, according to reports.Meanwhile, U.S. regulators and politicians have been increasingly turning their attention to crypto policy in recent months, as a spate of bankruptcies and crypto bank runs have eroded confidence in the emerging asset class.In September, for example, the Biden White House released its first-ever framework on what crypto regulation in the U.S. should look like — including ways to crack down on fraud in the digital asset space.— CNBC's Brian Schwartz contributed to this report."

Both assets ended their fourth down weeks in the last five.Crypto jumped Thursday, following the movement of stocks after the consumer price index came out showing higher-than-expected inflation. That reading initially sent risk assets down sharply before they reversed and soared, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average staging a historic 1,500-point rally.""Yesterday we saw a knee jerk reaction lower in all markets which was algo-driven, then short-covering and real buying stepped in, which was the right response to the CPI data,"" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca.

2022-10-14,"Nearly 40% of millennials and Gen Zers who own cryptocurrency plan to use it to make payments, according to PYMNT and BitPay's ""Paying With Crypto"" survey.Retailers are taking notice. About 75% of them plan to begin accepting crypto or stablecoin payments within the next two years, according to a recent Deloitte survey.A number of companies are already welcoming payments with digital currencies — just not directly.For example, Flexa, a digital payments platform, partners with a variety of retailers and enables them to accept payments made with crypto such as bitcoin and ether. Spedn, the company's mobile application, is currently available for Apple and Android devices.Users store their crypto in the app's digital wallet and then can use a code to spend their funds at various participating stores. ChipotleRegal CinemasWhole FoodsBaskin RobbinGamestopFlexa converts users cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars in real time, according to a 2019 press release. That means the price a user pays for a given product depends on the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the crypto that user is paying with at the time of purchase.Despite the crypto market's wild price fluctuations, Flexa guarantees merchants that they'll receive their payment in whichever currency they choose, such as U.S. dollars, with zero conversion fees.Another indirect way to spend your crypto is through gift cards. Services like Coincards and Bitrefill allow users to buy gift cards for a variety of companies such as Amazon and Delta using crypto.Traditional payment processors are also entering the world crypto payments. In 2020, Mastercard partnered with Bitpay to introduce a debit card that allows users to convert their crypto into fiat currency such as dollars that can then be spent anywhere Mastercard is accepted.Before using crypto to buy a burrito bowl, an ice cream sundae, or a movie ticket, though, remember that cryptocurrency is a highly volatile asset that is subject to unpredictable rises and falls in value. Odds are you don't want to end up like the infamous bitcoin pizza guy.The fact that crypto fluctuates so much also means that there's no guarantee you'll be able to receive a refund of the same value on a product you've purchased using crypto.That's one of the many reasons why financial experts typically advise that you only invest as much money in cryptocurrency as you're willing to lose.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Why Kim Kardashian’s $1.26 million SEC settlement over her crypto promo matters—especially for millennial and Gen Z investors"

The value of the crypto moved Tuesday totaled about $940 million and the transactions were partially split into batches of 122 bitcoins, which is a familiar pattern that came to fruition several times in the 2021 bull run, according to Maarten Regterschot, a CryptoQuant contributing analyst.He also said the transactions were likely done in over-the-counter trading desks, and therefore might not affect the price of bitcoin.Bitcoin was traded 1.5% lower Tuesday at $19,233.71. Ether was down 1.7% to $1,301.46. Both have been trading steadily sideways for about a month.Meanwhile, while bitcoin's correlation with stocks has fallen from its all-time high last month, it remains at historic highs and its price is still largely driven by macro triggers points, like key economic data reports and central bank policy. Its uncharacteristically low volatility, however, has been top of mind for the crypto market in recent days. ""Bitcoin has failed to make any significant moves since early June, with prices bouncing between an increasingly narrow range,"" said Kaiko's director of research, Clara Medalie. ""Considering bitcoin's current low price levels, trade volumes have remained relatively resilient since last year's all-time highs. There is no discernable decrease in volumes since September despite the increasingly low volatility.""Elsewhere, the major stock indexes were making solid up moves on Tuesday morning. Crypto equities were mostly in the green with the exception of ""crypto bank"" Silvergate, whose earnings amid the recent apathy in crypto came in weaker-than-expected Tuesday, according to FactSet."
2022-10-18,"Apple will likely launch an iPad with a folding screen in 2024, analyst firm CCS Insight said on Tuesday.CCS Insight said a foldable iPad would likely come before a folding iPhone, bucking the trend of consumer electronics companies launching folding screen smartphones. The analyst firm also predicts that Apple is likely to integrate its own 5G modem into the A series of processor for a ""single-chip"" solution for iPhones in 2025.  Apple will likely launch an iPad with a folding screen in 2024, analyst firm CCS Insight said on Tuesday, forecasting the U.S. technology giant will begin experimenting with foldable technology soon.CCS Insight published its annual predictions report on Tuesday in which the group' analysts make forecasts about future products and trends.In the latest report, CCS Insight predicted Apple would launch a foldable iPad in two years' time rather than start with a foldable iPhone.This is contrary to other smartphone makers like Samsung which have launched foldable smartphones rather than tablets.""Right now it doesn't make sense for Apple to make a foldable iPhone. We think they will shun that trend and probably dip a toe in the water with a foldable iPad,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC in an interview.""A folding iPhone will be super high risk for Apple. Firstly, it would have to be incredibly expensive in order to not cannibalize the existing iPhones,"" Wood added.

Here's where analysts see it heading next.These tech stocks have never been more compelling, Goldman Sachs saysBank of America says this chip stock is the best way to play the electric vehicle transition The analyst said that a foldable iPhone would likely need to cost around $2,500. Apple's iPhone 14 Pro Max with the largest storage, which is the most expensive model currently, costs around $1,599.Wood also said that if Apple had any technical issues with the foldable phone, then it would be a ""feeding frenzy"" with critics attacking Apple for the problems.Still, Apple has ""no option but to react because the trend toward foldables is gathering momentum,"" Wood said, hence the company will begin with an iPad.He said it would give Apple a chance to learn how to implement and scale foldable screen technology as well as ""breathe new life"" into the iPad range.Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.There have been a number of rumblings about Apple's intentions with foldable screen products. Earlier this year, market research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants said Apple is unlikely to enter the foldable smartphone market until 2025 at the earliest. However, the company said that Apple is exploring foldable technology for displays of around 20 inches in size. That could be focused on a new foldable notebook product, the market research company said.Predictions about a foldable iPhone meanwhile have been around for at least four years. Last year, Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities, a prominent Apple analyst known for his credible predictions, said the company could release an iPhone with a folding screen in 2024.  CCS Insight also predicts that Apple will continue investing in its own chip design.Currently, the Cupertino giant designs its own custom chips for iPhone and iPad. It relies on U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm for modems that allow these devices to connect to mobile internet networks for 5G connectivity.However, CCS Insight said that Apple is likely to integrate its own 5G modem into the A series of processor for a ""single-chip"" solution for iPhones in 2025. Apple acquired Intel's modem business in 2019. That led to speculation that the tech giant would very quickly ditch Qualcomm and use its own modems in its devices. However, that hasn't happened yet.Kuo of TF International Securities said in June he expects the company to continue to use Qualcomm chips for iPhones released in 2023.Wood said that Apple has been ""ramping up in-house capabilities"" so it can use its own modems in iPhones.""They (Apple) have been shooting for this target for years. They acquired the assets from Intel of the modem unit, they have been working hard to ramp that up, they are very keen to make sure they keep growing their control points they have,"" Wood said.""They don't want to have to keep paying a third party supplier for their technology."""
2022-10-18,"Stocks moved lower on Wednesday as Wall Street struggled to extend its rally amid a sharp rise in Treasury yields.The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.85% to close at 10,680.51. The S&P 500 ticked down 0.67% to 3,695.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 99.99 points, or 0.33%, to finish the day at 30,423.81. The losses ended a two-day winning streak, though all three averages are still up for the week. Earnings season is off to a solid start, but Treasury yields remained elevated on Wednesday, suggesting that recession fears are still intact. The 10-year Treasury yield traded as high as 4.136%, the highest level since July 23, 2008.""If you keep things simple and say the 10-year Treasury is the risk-free rate that basically the majority of other asset classes in the world are priced off of ... that is going to cause choppy markets across the board,"" Keith Lerner, co-CIO and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, said of the bond market volatility.""The market is overall hanging in there somewhat, I don't want to say well, but not as bad as it could be given that 4% is a demarcation line that has really pressured equities,"" Lerner added.The impact of higher rates is being shown sharply in the housing market, where housing starts fell faster than expected in September, the Census Bureau said on Wednesday.The rate move also weighed on more speculative tech stocks. Among the biggest losers in the Nasdaq were Chinese tech stocks JD.com, falling more than 7%, and Baidu, sinking 8.8%.The declines for the broader market came even as Netflix shares rallied more than 13% after the streaming giant posted earnings and revenue that beat estimates as well as strong subscriber growth for the third quarter.

The percentage of up days this year is the lowest the index has seen since 1974, when the market ended the year down nearly 30%, Smith wrote. That weak day-to-day performance does not necessarily mean stocks are in for a long bear market. ""The good news from this data is that the year following on from one with such few up days tends to see well above average returns, with an average and median return of 12% and 17% respectively,"" Smith wrote. He added that investors should treat this data with caution.

Kashkari said services and wage inflation are pushing higher, two key elements that he is watching for direction on monetary policy.""I'm looking for some evidence that those have in effect stopped climbing. I haven't seen that evidence yet,"" he said during a Q&A session aired on the Minneapolis Fed site.

The report noted that the pace of economic growth was uneven across the country, with areas reporting that higher interest rates, inflation and supply chain disruptions held back activity. ""Retail spending was relatively flat, reflecting lower discretionary spending, and auto dealers noted sustained sluggishness in sales stemming from limited inventories, high vehicle prices, and rising interest rates,"" the report said.

The tech giant is set to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.""Currency and PC headwinds are likely to impact MSFT's FQ1 results and may drive reported results below consensus again.

As II points out, lots of bears also equals lots of cash on the sidelines, offering added firepower if only part of it  returns to stocks.Even at the peak of Covid-related bearishness in March 2020, bears never got above 41.7%.More bears than bulls also means less risk in the stock market, II says.

That led to a miss on both profit and revenue for the quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates.Known primarily as an auto lender and online bank, analysts are watching how the company navigates weakening credit trends, particularly among subprime borrowers. Default rates on auto loans have begun to rise from historically low levels as Americans spend down balances fattened during the pandemic.The bank also said Tuesday that its CFO was departing, a move that caught some off guard given its timing shortly ahead of Ally's earnings release.""This announcement, one day prior to the expected earnings release tomorrow morning, comes as a surprise and likely will cause some uncertainty in the market,"" Piper Sandler analyst Kevin Barker wrote Tuesday in a note.

But the firm still views the stock as underperforming and expects it to fall another 23% in 2023.Analyst Kenneth Worthington said the stock's short-term outlook was helped by better trading volume, especially among higher-revenue index options, in September. He also said the company was boosted by short-term tailwinds like higher rates that would increase earnings and better cash treatment.Still, he said those near-term aids do not change the fact that long-term profitability of stock is ""elusive."" Robinhood is part of a group of companies that went public through initial public offerings during the pandemic but are now struggling.""While the founders have leveraged innovation, guts, and ideal market conditions to build a leading US retail broker, we do not see growth as sustainable,"" he said in a note to clients. ""We question the ability of the company to generate competitive margins over time given the focus on such small accounts that have limited room to be profitable.""Robinhood is down 41.2% percent this year.

That means revenue growth is now more likely to fall below Wall Street expectations of 38%.It follows similarly downtrodden third-quarter guidance as the company expects earnings per share at $1.75 compared to an estimate of $3.21.

2022-10-19,"Nubank said Wednesday it will launch the token, called Nucoin, in the first half of 2023.Nubank said it would invite 2,000 customers to take part in a forum group for guiding the development of Nucoin.The new token offering comes against a bleak backdrop for cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin and other major digital assets down over 50% year-to-date. The Brazilian digital banking startup Nubank will launch its own cryptocurrency in the country next year, marking the latest move into digital assets by a large financial institution.Nubank said Wednesday it will launch the token, called Nucoin, in the first half of 2023. In a press release, the company touts Nucoin as ""a new way to recognize customer loyalty and encourage engagement with Nubank products."" Nubank said it plans to offer discounts and other perks to holders of the token.""The project is another step ahead in our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology and to democratize it even more, going beyond the purchase, sale and maintenance of cryptocurrencies in the Nu app,"" Fernando Czapski, general manager for Nucoin at Nubank, said in a statement.Nubank said it would invite 2,000 customers to take part in a forum group for guiding the development of Nucoin, ""adhering to common practices in blockchain projects,"" according to the firm. ""In this phase, more than feedback, the proposal is to explore a decentralized process of product creation, characteristic of Web3,"" Nubank said.The cryptocurrency was built on the Polygon network, a so-called ""Layer 2"" protocol that aims to alleviate congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, where transactions can often be costly and take long to process. Polygon says its platform is able to support thousands of transactions per second.Nubank isn't the first bank to launch its own cryptocurrency. JPMorgan rolled out its own token, JPMCoin, a so-called stablecoin that maintains a one-to-one peg to the U.S. dollar. Unlike that coin, Nucoin's price fluctuates in value based on supply and demand, similar to coins like bitcoin and ether.It follows other steps from banking and payment companies into the crypto market. In October, Mastercard launched a new tool, Crypto Secure, aimed at helping card issuers prevent fraud involving crypto exchanges. Firms like PayPal and Robinhood also offer trading in cryptocurrencies. The Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, has its own internal crypto trading desk.The new token offering comes against a bleak backdrop for cryptocurrencies. The market is currently in a deep downturn investors are calling ""crypto winter,"" with many digital coins — including the world's largest, bitcoin — having lost over half of their value since the start of 2022.Regulators have since gotten more wary about digital currencies and the potential harms they pose to consumers, with governments in the U.S., European Union and elsewhere introducing frameworks for regulating the industry.Asked whether Nubank had sought regulatory approval in Brazil before launching its token, a spokesperson for the company said it ""constantly evaluates the regulatory framework as an important part of our product development process.""Nubank launched in 2013 with a purple no-fee credit card in Sao Paulo, Brazil, a country notorious for its high-fee, low-tech banking system. Since its launch nine years ago, the company has amassed 70 million users across Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.Nubank, which went public late last year, counts famed investor Warren Buffett among its roster of backers. Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway took a $500 million stake in Nubank in June 2021. The company is valued by the stock market at $20.4 billion, roughly half what it was worth in its December 2021 debut.Nubank has previously gotten into the crypto game through its Nucripto platform, which offers trading in a range of tokens including bitcoin and ether. The exchange, which relies on tech from blockchain infrastructure startup Paxos, reached 1 million users in July a month after launching."

2022-10-19,"Starting in 2023, individuals can transfer up to $12.92 million to heirs, during life or at death, without triggering a federal estate-tax bill, up from $12.06 million this year. There's also a higher annual limit on tax-free gifts in 2023, rising to $17,000 from $16,000. Ultra-wealthy Americans can soon protect more assets from federal estate taxes, the IRS announced this week. Starting in 2023, individuals can transfer up to $12.92 million to heirs, during life or at death, without triggering a federal estate-tax bill, up from $12.06 million in 2022. Since married couples may share exclusions by electing portability, their combined limits are double, allowing transfers of up to nearly $26 million for 2023, compared to just over $24 million this year. More from Personal Finance:IRS: Here are the new income tax brackets for 2023There's time to get Series I bonds paying 9.62% for six months'Personal inflation rates' vary by where you live, other factorsNext year, there's also a higher annual limit on tax-free gifts. In 2023, filers can give away $17,000 per recipient without reducing their $12.92 million lifetime exclusion. That's up from this year's $16,000.   These increases are part of the agency's annual inflation adjustments, affecting federal income tax brackets, standard deductions and dozens of other provisions.Whether the estate-tax exclusion is $12.06 million or $12.92 million, it won't likely make a ""material difference,"" said Adam Brewer, a tax attorney with AB Tax Law in San Diego and Honolulu. ""But certainly, every bit helps, so why not take advantage of it?"" With the stock market down in 2022, many are sitting on lower-value portfolios and the higher exclusion next year may provide opportunities for ""more aggressive"" estate-planning techniques, such as shielding wealth via trusts, he said. ""It just seems like almost a no-brainer,"" Brewer said. The estate-tax exclusion has roughly doubled since Republicans' signature tax overhaul in 2017. Without further action from Congress, the provision will sunset after 2025, leaving a limited window to leverage the higher limits.Still, many affected taxpayers have worked with advisors to prepare for the ""potential risk,"" according to Brewer. ""We're talking about ultra-wealthy individuals here,"" he said, and these families won't have a significant chunk of their wealth hurt by ""the whims of Congress.""Regardless of what legislation happens, 2023 is shaping up to be a ""very big year for estate planning,"" Brewer added."
2022-10-20,"When the Justice Department announced it seized billions in stolen cryptocurrency earlier this year, it seemed like great news for victims of a hack that drained around $70 million from customers' accounts on the Bitfinex trading platform in 2016. ""It was the biggest relief of my life,"" said Frankie Cavazos, who lost 15 bitcoins in the hack. Over the course of the last six years, the value of the stolen crypto skyrocketed. At the time of the hack, a single bitcoin was worth less than a thousand dollars. Today it would be trading for around $20,000. For Cavazos, getting his bitcoins back would be ""a life-changing amount of money."" But so far thousands of victims like him haven't experienced the happy ending they were hoping for. Instead, they're embroiled in a battle over who is the legal owner of all that stolen crypto.On the day the news broke that the funds had been recovered, Bitfinex publicly asserted that the stolen bitcoins should be returned to the platform in a statement: ""Bitfinex will work with the DOJ and follow appropriate legal processes to establish our rights to a return of the stolen bitcoin.""That's because the company believes it's already made its customers whole by providing them with a variety of digital tokens that customers could sell in exchange for cash after the hack. A company spokesperson told CNBC that Bitfinex customers could have sold the tokens for cash and then used the cash to buy more bitcoins at the time.The decision to offer customers tokens came after the company decided to generalize its losses across all account holders by 36%. That meant everyone who had a Bitfinex account lost 36% of their assets – not just users whose accounts were hacked.The first token the company created was called a BFX token. Customers received one BFX token for each dollar they lost. Cavazos told CNBC he felt like Bitfinex just ""dumped"" those tokens on its customers and said he was not given the option to decline the BFX token.He and several other Bitfinex hack victims spoke exclusively to CNBC for the documentary ""Crocodile of Wall Street,"" which reports on the theft of the bitcoins and the alleged attempt to launder the stolen crypto. One issue customers brought up to CNBC is that when they decided to sell their tokens they were actually worth pennies on the dollar.""They pegged 'em to $1 per BFX token,"" Cavazos said. ""They put 'em on the open market and it went from $1 to, like, 20 cents, so they were essentially allowed to basically FOMO everyone out of their debt."" Rafal Bielenia, who had 91 bitcoins on the platform said: ""I sold those tokens as fast as possible immediately when they became available. And I was only able to get like 25% of their value."" He believes, ""there was no point in time that they refunded me – not in dollar terms, and not in bitcoin terms."" For customers who didn't sell the tokens immediately, the company later gave BFX token holders a chance to convert their tokens into equity shares of iFinex, the corporate entity behind Bitfinex through other tokens the company created called RRT and LEO.To put it simply, Bitfinex feels the customers have already been compensated fairly and if they chose to sell the tokens before their value reached a dollar, that was their choice to make. In a statement, the company told CNBC, ""Upon receipt of the bitcoins recovered from the 2016 security breach, Bitfinex has pledged to use 80 percent of the proceeds to buy back and burn LEO tokens, after all RRTs are redeemed.""Essentially, Bitfinex wants the bitcoins that were stolen in the 2016 hack returned to the company and it will give a portion of that back to some of their customers in cash, not in bitcoins.But some of the hack victims still assert the bitcoins belong to them. And the idea that they could lose their bitcoins not once, but twice, seems impossible.""Why would anybody question that I should get my money back? That was my property,"" Bielenia said.""I still am going to be trying to get ahold of these 15 bitcoins because I truly believe they are mine,"" Cavazos said. ""I can prove it through the blockchain explorers."" Will Hogarth, who also had his crypto stolen in the Bitfinex hack, told CNBC, ""I still expect my bitcoin back and I don't see any reason why they would keep it.""U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told CNBC, ""Victims, individuals and entities whose money, who claimed that's their money, that they were victimized by this money laundering scheme will submit claims ultimately to a court who will decide how that money is dispersed."" However, no further details about that process have been released.  For now, the holdup seems to be that there has been no resolution in the court case involving the couple investigators say got caught holding the stolen cryptocurrency. Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein have been charged with conspiring to launder billions in bitcoin.Morgan is an aspiring rapper who called herself ""the Crocodile of Wall Street"" and Lichtenstein a self-described ""tech entrepreneur, explorer and part time magician."" The duo is facing more than two decades in prison if they're found guilty. They have not yet entered a plea. CNBC reached out to Morgan and Lichtenstein to hear their side of the story, neither agreed to an interview. So far, no one has been charged with hacking Bitfinex in the first place.As their case makes its way through the court system, a multibillion-dollar battle over what happens to the money is brewing.""Ultimately, it's going to be a dog fight as to who gets this money. Whether or not the government gets to keep it, whether or not Bitfinex gets to keep it, whether or not the customers get it back -- anyone who tells you there's a clear answer is lying for their own benefit,"" said cryptocurrency attorney David Silver. With billions of dollars on the line, Silver expects ""people are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to get their hands on that pot of gold.""""I do think it's going to be a fight,"" Cavazos agreed,""The end of this story -- we don't know yet,"" he said. ""But you can't just simply walk away with a hack like this. There's someone that's going to be caught up in this that has to tell the truth and when that shoe drops, it's going to be really interesting and it's going to impact who gets the money."""
2022-10-20,"N26 Crypto will let users buy and sell 100 tokens including bitcoin and ether.The feature is first launching in Austria. N26 plans to expand it to other markets in the next six months.An N26 executive said interest in cryptocurrencies ""remains super high, even in a bear market."" European digital bank N26 announced Thursday it is launching a crypto trading service, starting with Austria as the first market for the product.The service, called N26 Crypto, is set to become available to N26's Austrian clients in the coming weeks and will initially include 100 tokens including bitcoin and ether. N26 plans to roll out the feature to users in other markets over the next six months and eventually expand its token offering to include a total 194 coins.Gilles BianRosa, N26's chief product officer, told CNBC the bank's crypto brokerage feature allows users to ""dip their toes into the water in a way that's not frothy.""To make a trade, users select a coin and specify how much they want to buy or sell. Once they complete their order, cash is deducted from their main account balance and appears alongside the token of their choice. Customers can also ""drag and drop"" funds from their main account into their crypto portfolio, or vice versa, N26 said.Berlin-based N26 is a bit of a latecomer to the crypto rush. Fintech rivals PayPal and Revolut have long offered their users the ability to buy and sell digital assets, and payment leviathans Visa and Mastercard also sell their clients crypto and so-called ""Web3"" services. On Wednesday, Brazilian digital bank Nubank launched its own token, called Nucoin.""Our users are extremely interested in crypto,"" BianRosa said in an interview. ""That interest remains super high, even in a bear market.""N26's crypto foray could have been better timed. Bitcoin and other tokens are deep in the red this year after investors fled the market due to fears over higher interest rates and liquidity constraints. While main street banks have steered clear of crypto due to concerns over its sharp volatility and involvement in fraud, N26 — which holds an EU banking license — is dipping its toes into the space out of the belief that it's more than ""just a fad."" ""We want to take a pretty long-term view around this,"" BianRosa said. ""It's not like we're trying to time the launch on how the market is doing.""N26 is charging a 2.5% fee on buy and sell orders for all cryptocurrencies — other than bitcoin, which it offers at a reduced transaction fee of 1.5%. For subscribers to its paid Metal accounts, which cost 16.90 euros ($16.54) a month, the transaction fee is 1% on bitcoin and 2% for all other tokens.The feature is powered by Bitpanda, the Austrian crypto and stock trading app that shares N26 backer Peter Thiel as an investor — with Bitpanda pocketing a commission on each trade processed through N26. N26 said it plans to support trading in other asset types over time.The move may cause discomfort for regulators, who've gotten much stricter in their approach to crypto after the $2 trillion market wipeout this year. The European Union in particular has sought to crack down on the ""Wild West"" of crypto, with incoming rules expected to enhance investor protections around digital assets. N26 has previously had restrictions placed on its growth by BaFin, the German financial watchdog, due to alleged failings in its fraud prevention systems.""We have a very strong working relationship with all the regulators, so obviously we inform them of our plans, they're aware and we've covered all the regulatory needs we have for this market,"" BianRosa said.A BaFin spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on individual banks but that, generally, ""banks must comply with any statutory obligations for the prevention of money laundering and all other banking supervisory requirements also when doing business with crypto assets."" The Austrian Financial Market Authority, which supervises the market in which N26 is first launching its crypto service, said any questions on the move should be directed at BaFin.Notably, N26's crypto service doesn't include support for custodial wallets, meaning customers are unable to move their assets off the platform. Platforms like Robinhood and Revolut have introduced features giving users more control over their crypto assets lately. BianRosa said this creates a ""closed-circuit investment loop"" where users' assets are sealed in a controlled environment. It's a feature some of crypto's biggest proponents might say is at odds with the technology's decentralized roots. But N26 argues this offers greater protection for its users. Clients have to fulfill identity verification checks before becoming eligible to make crypto trades.""It's not like you can convert those bitcoins and buy something from the dark web with those assets from your wallet,"" N26's product chief said.N26 is one of Europe's largest fintechs, scoring a $9 billion valuation in its most recent financing round last year. Like other fintechs, however, the firm is losing money. N26 racked up net losses of 172.4 million euros ($168.8 million) in 2021, a 14% increase from the year before."
2022-10-20,"Crypto service provider Prime Trust agreed Thursday to return $17 million from crypto lending platform Celsius that was allegedly withheld just as digital currencies hit their first bottom last year.Prime Trust, which offers custodial services for digital assets, held $119 million of Celsius' assets when the two terminated their contract in June 2021, according to the lawsuit Celsius filed against Prime Trust in August. Prime Trust ""refused to fulfill its obligation"" by transferring the $17 million in crypto assets when the contract was dissolved, Celsius said. Bitcoin seesawed last year, hitting a record in April 2021 of $63,000 before losing almost half of its value by July. It resurged to a fresh record of over $64,000 in November and is now trading at around $19,000. Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July. Prime Trust agreed  at a hearing at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on Thursday to return the crypto assets to settle the lawsuit. Those assets will be held in a separate account until the court figures out how to distribute Celsius' assets."
2022-10-24,"After getting some tips from law enforcement, Binance is now “narrowing down” the hacker behind the attack, CEO Changpeng Zhao told CNBC Monday.Zhao said the BNB Chain was able to prevent around 80% to 90% of the targeted funds from being taken by the hacker. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is getting closer to figuring out the identity of a hacker that orchestrated a $570 million hack on its BNB blockchain, CEO Changpeng Zhao told CNBC Monday.After getting some tips from law enforcement on who the hacker might be, Binance is now ""narrowing down"" the person or persons behind the attack, Zhao said in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""The attack in question saw a so-called cross-chain bridge targeted, allowing an as-yet unknown hacker or hackers to withdraw 2 million of Binance's BNB tokens worth around $570 million at the time.More than $1 billion has been lost to breaches on cross-chain bridges so far this year, tools that facilitate the swift transfer of tokens from one blockchain platform to another, according to Chainalysis data.Popular in the world of ""DeFi,"" or decentralized finance, bridges have become a hot target for criminals due to faults in their underlying code.""We're still actually chasing … helping [authorities] to chase the bad players, working with law enforcement around the globe,"" Zhao said. ""Working with law enforcement is one of the ways that we can try to make the space safe."" ""Actually, in this particular instant, law enforcement gave us some tips of who they think it might be. So we're actually narrowing down.""Binance intervened to limit the damage of the attack, pausing activity on its BNB Chain blockchain network after coordinating with network validators — individuals and entities that sign off on transaction approvals — to enact an upgrade.Zhao, who is commonly referred to as ""CZ"" online, said this meant BNB Chain was able to prevent most of the targeted funds from being taken by the hacker.""The blockchain was able to freeze about 80% to 90% of it, so the actual loss of it was much smaller,"" he said.The ""vast majority of the funds remain under control,"" Binance's BNB Chain said in a statement at the time of the hack. About $100 million was unrecoverable, BNB Chain added.The BNB Chain, originally known as Binance Chain, was first developed by Binance in 2019. Like other blockchains, it features a native token, called BNB, that can be traded or used in games and other applications."
2022-10-24,"The IRS has released draft guidance for cryptocurrency and other digital asset reporting for 2022 tax returns.The agency plans to change the term ""virtual currency"" to ""digital asset"" in a question, and provide more guidance on how to answer. However, experts say that reporting questions still remain for filers and tax professionals. The IRS is sharing more details on how to report digital assets for the 2022 tax filing year, according to draft instructions.Since 2019, there's been a yes or no ""virtual currency"" question on tax returns, requiring filers to check a box to disclose their taxable crypto activity. For 2022, the agency has changed the term ""virtual currency"" to ""digital asset,"" with more guidance on when to check ""yes.""Notably, ""digital asset"" now includes non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, which grant ownership to items like art, and stablecoins, which are pegged to a real-world asset.More from Personal Finance:How much you can earn and pay 0% capital gains taxes in 2023IRS bumps up estate tax exclusion to $12.92 million for 2023What 8.7% Social Security cost-of-living adjustment means for taxes on benefits""I think that's a good change,"" said Matt Metras, an enrolled agent and cryptocurrency tax specialist at MDM Financial Services in Rochester, New York. ""People who trade things like NFTs would not think of that as a virtual currency.""The ""broader language"" may include new categories, such as taxpayers receiving digital assets from ""play-to-earn games,"" which have become popular over the past year, he said. ""The IRS is always going to be behind the eight ball because they just can't keep up with how fast the crypto space is changing,"" Metras said.The draft instructions say filers must check ""yes"" if they received digital assets as a reward, award or payment for property or services. And the agency may also require ""yes"" if filers sold, exchanged or gifted digital assets. Despite the agency's attempts to clarify guidance on digital asset reporting, questions remain for filers and tax professionals. For example, filers aren't required to submit a gift tax return for transfers under $16,000 for 2022. However, the question requires taxpayers to check ""yes"" for gifts that may be below that amount, said Andrew Gordon, tax attorney, CPA and president of Gordon Law Group in Skokie, Illinois.This may cause IRS processing issues without corresponding gift activity elsewhere on the return. Overall, ""there still seems to be an education gap for taxpayers,"" he added. The American Institute of CPAs has also expressed concerns over the lack of clarity for taxpayers, referencing the ""cryptographically secured distributed ledger"" in the instructions, which may confuse filers. ""We suggest IRS and Treasury keep the question focused on 'virtual currency' until proposed and final regulations are issued defining 'digital assets,'"" said Eileen Sherr, director of tax policy and advocacy at the American Institute of CPAs. The organization submitted comments to the IRS about the question in late August, asking for revisions and clearer instructions with examples before finalizing the 2022 tax return."
2022-10-24,"While there is a growing chorus of voices who say that the Federal Reserve should slow or halt its rate increases, JPMorgan President Daniel Pinto is not in that camp.""I think putting inflation back in a box is very important,"" Pinto told CNBC in an interview. ""If it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time, that is the price we have to pay.""""I don't think we've seen the bottom of the market yet,"" he said, adding that corporate earnings expectations were still too high. Pinto, who leads the world's biggest investment bank by revenue, called cryptocurrencies a small asset class that is ""kind of irrelevant"" at the moment.  JPMorgan Chase President Daniel Pinto has vivid memories of what life is like when a country loses control of inflation.As a child growing up in Argentina, Pinto, 59, said that inflation was often so high, prices for food and other goods spiked on an hourly basis. Workers could lose 20% of their salary if they didn't rush to convert their paycheck into U.S. dollars, he said.""Supermarkets had these armies of people using machines to relabel products, sometimes 10 to 15 times a day,"" Pinto said. ""At the end of the day, they had to remove all the labels and start over again the next day.""The experiences of Pinto, a Wall Street veteran who runs the world's biggest investment bank by revenue, informs his views at a key time for markets and the economy.After unleashing trillions of dollars in support of households and businesses in 2020, the Federal Reserve is grappling with inflation at four-decade highs by raising rates and pulling back on its debt-buying programs. The moves have cratered stocks and bonds this year and rippled around the world as a surging dollar complicates other nations' own battles with inflation.Living with pervasive inflation was ""very, very stressful"" and is especially hard on low-income families, Pinto said in a recent interview from JPMorgan's New York headquarters. Price increases averaged more than 300% a year in Argentina from 1975 to 1991. While there is a growing chorus of voices who say the Federal Reserve should slow or halt its rate increases amid some signs of price moderation, Pinto is not in that camp.""That's why when people say, `the Fed is too hawkish,' I disagree,"" said Pinto, who became JPMorgan's sole president and chief operating officer earlier this year, solidifying his status as CEO Jamie Dimon's top lieutenant and potential successor.""I think putting inflation back in a box is very important,"" he said. ""If it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time, that is the price we have to pay."" The Fed can't allow inflation to become ingrained in the economy, according to the executive. A premature return to easier monetary policy risks repeating the mistakes of the '70s and '80s, he said.That's why he thinks it's more likely the Fed errs on the side of being aggressive on rates. The fed funds rate will probably peak at around 5%; that, along with a rise in unemployment, will likely curb inflation, Pinto said. The rate is currently in a 3% to 3.25% range. Like a string of other executives have said recently, including Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, the U.S. faces a recession because of the Fed's predicament, Pinto said. The only question is how severe the slowdown will be. That, of course, is being reflected in the markets that Pinto watches daily.""We're dealing with a market that is pricing the probability of recession and how deep it's going to be,"" Pinto said.The economic situation this year has been unlike any other in recent history; apart from booming price increases for goods and services, corporate earnings have been relatively resilient, confusing investors looking for signs of a slowdown.But profit estimates haven't fallen far enough to reflect what's coming, according to Pinto, and that could mean the market takes another leg down. The S&P 500 has dropped 21% this year as of Friday.""I don't think we've seen the bottom of the market yet,"" Pinto said. ""When you think about corporate earnings heading into next year, expectations may still be too elevated; multiples in some equity markets including the S&P are probably a bit high."" Still, despite higher volatility that he expects to remain, Pinto said the markets have been functioning ""better than I was expecting."" With the notable exception of the collapse in U.K. government bonds, known as ""gilts,"" that led to the resignation of that country's prime minister last week, markets have been orderly, he said.That could change if the Ukraine war takes a perilous new turn, or tensions with China over Taiwan spill onto the global stage, upending progress on supply chains, among other potential pitfalls. Markets have become more fragile in some ways because post-2008 crisis reforms forced banks to hold more capital tied to trading, which makes markets more likely to seize up during periods of great volatility.""Geopolitics is the big black swan on the horizon that hopefully doesn't play out,"" Pinto said.Even after central banks get a handle on inflation, its likely that interest rates will be higher in the future than they were in the past decade and a half, he said. Low or even negative rates around the world have been the defining characteristic of the previous era.That low-rate regime has punished savers and benefited borrowers and riskier companies who could continue to tap debt markets. It also led to a wave of investment in private companies, including the fintech firms taking on JPMorgan and its peers, and supercharged the stock of tech companies as investors paid up for growth.""Real rates should be higher in the next 20 years than they were in the last 20 years,"" Pinto said. ""Nothing crazy, but higher, and that affects many things like the valuations of growth companies."" The post-financial crisis era also gave rise to new forms of digital money: cryptocurrencies including bitcoin. While JPMorgan and rivals including Morgan Stanley and others have allowed wealth management clients to get exposure to crypto, there appears to be little progress recently in terms of its institutional adoption, according to Pinto.""The reality is, the current form of crypto has become a small asset class that is kind of irrelevant in the scheme of things,"" he said. ""But the technology, the concepts, something is probably going to happen there; just not in its current form.""As for the broader economy, there are reasons for optimism amid the gloom.Households and businesses have strong balance sheets, which should cushion the pain of a downturn. There is far less leverage lurking in the regulated banking system than in 2008, and higher mortgage standards should result in a less punishing default cycle this time.""Things that triggered problems in the past are in a far better position now,"" Pinto said. ""That said, you hope nothing new pops up."""

Not even Google is immune from the Crypto winter.In Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, blamed a slowdown in revenue growth in part on reduced ad spending by cypto companies and other financial firms.""In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas in search,"" Schindler said. ""For example in financial services, we saw a pullback in the insurance, loan, mortgage, and crypto subcategories.""Google's overall ad growth of 6% in the quarter was the weakest for any period since 2013, other than one quarter at the beginning of the pandemic. YouTube ad revenue shrank from a year earlier. CEO Sundar Pichai said the ""challenging macro climate"" is having an impact on Google's ad business.Schindler referenced the crypto pullback twice, but he didn't provide any additional color or specifics.

2022-10-28,"Thierry Breton, EU commissioner for the internal market, said Twitter will have to ""fly by our rules"" after Elon Musk's $44 billion purchase of the company.Tech companies will face greater pressure to remove illegal content under the EU's incoming Digital Services Act.Companies can be fined up to 6% of global annual revenues for violations of the rules, which are expected to come into force in 2024. A top European Union official had a warning for Elon Musk Friday about his $44 purchase of Twitter, telling the billionaire he will have to play by the rules.After a cryptic tweet from Musk suggesting he'd completed his acquisition of Twitter, Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market, warned Musk that he will have to comply with the bloc's new digital regulations.""The bird is freed,"" Musk tweeted. In response, Breton quote-tweeted Musk saying: ""In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules.""Although not officially confirmed, a spokesperson for crypto exchange Binance, which provided Musk equity financing for the Twitter takeover, said Friday the transaction had been completed.Musk, one of Twitter's most popular users, is known for tweeting everything from announcements about Tesla and his other companies, to memes and attacks on his critics.The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has previously called himself a ""free speech absolutist,"" and says he wants to reform Twitter as a ""digital town square"" with fewer restrictions on what users can say.That will have ramifications for the way content is moderated on Twitter, a key concern for regulators looking to rein in digital giants over the spread of hate speech and disinformation online.Under the European Union's recently approved Digital Services Act, large tech companies will be required to have robust content moderation systems to ensure they can quickly take down illegal material such as hate speech, incitement to terrorism and child sexual abuse. For his part, Musk has said he wouldn't allow illegal content on the platform.The EU's rules are expected to come into force by 2024. Companies can be fined up to 6% of global annual revenues for violations.Guy Verhofstadt, a member of the European Parliament, said Friday that ""the need for rules and accountability is bigger than ever.""""So one man @elonmusk now owns the biggest debate in the world …"" he said in a tweet. ""Self-regulation in social media has never worked … even with lesser characters than his.""Breton, a former CEO of French IT consulting firm Atos, is seen as a key architect of the European Union's digital reforms. Alongside the Digital Markets Act, which seeks to curb the dominance of internet giants, the Digital Services Act is part of a bold plan by the bloc to regulate Big Tech.In May, Musk and Breton met in person, and Musk at the time said the Digital Services Act was ""exactly aligned with my thinking.""But regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are worried that Musk could, for example, allow former President Donald Trump back onto the platform. Musk, who has previously said he would reverse the ban on Trump's account, reportedly intends to scrap lifetime bans on Twitter users, according to Bloomberg."

2022-11-01,"As finance minister, Rishi Sunak was a vocal advocate of crypto and blockchain technology.Now prime minister, he could give the industry a boost at a time when it needs good news, with digital assets having plummeted in value.There are a number of ways he could do so, and offering regulatory clarity is among the top requests from crypto firms and investors. U.K. cryptocurrency firms and investors have high hopes that new prime minister Rishi Sunak could turn around Britain's fading crypto aspirations.The new U.K. leader, who was finance minister in former PM Boris Johnson's government, faces a daunting to-do list, which includes undoing the economic havoc wreaked by his predecessor Liz Truss. Crypto isn't exactly high up on his priority list, but industry insiders say there's reason to be optimistic.""The feeling among entrepreneurs is one of relief,"" said Christian Faes, co-founder of digital lending startup LendInvest. ""There's a feeling that we finally have someone sensible in Number 10, after the arrogance and incompetence of Liz Truss and [ex-Finance Minister] Kwasi Kwarteng almost crashed the U.K. economy.""""Rishi sees the opportunity and potential that crypto has, and wants the U.K. to be a leader in it,"" Faes, who also chairs the Fintech Founders network, added.Sunak, a former Goldman Sachs analyst, has on several occasions expressed a positive attitude toward crypto. As the minister in charge of Britain's finances, he outlined a grand plan to make the country a global crypto hub in April. That included bringing stablecoins within the regulatory parameters and getting the Royal Mint, the official U.K. coin maker, to launch a nonfungible token.At a drinks reception organized by the venture capital firm Index Ventures in June, Sunak said he was ""determined"" to make the U.K. ""the jurisdiction of choice for crypto and blockchain technology.""But after weeks of political instability, crypto firms and investors are wondering what he'll do to boost the market, which is licking its wounds after a punishing few months for digital asset prices and a slew of corporate bankruptcies. Before Sunak's appointment as PM, confidence in the U.K.'s position in the global crypto market had been waning.In a survey of 300 British fintech founders, only 9% believe it's leading the way on crypto. Nearly 20% of founders thought the regulator was ""actively signalling"" the U.K. wasn't the place to start a crypto company, according to the survey by Fintech Founders.The Financial Conduct Authority has been criticized for being slow to approve licenses for crypto firms, an issue that has caused several companies to wind down and set up shop elsewhere in Europe.

According to data from Chainalysis, $233 billion in digital assets changed hands from July 2021 to June 2022. It didn't grow as much as Germany, though, where on-chain activity was up 47% year-over-year.As London looks compete with EU financial hubs after Brexit, crypto could be a way for it to improve its chances, industry insiders say.""There is an opportunity to provide clarity to the industry and allow it to play its role in achieving their mandate to encourage businesses to invest, to innovate, and to create jobs in the U.K.,"" Jordan Wain, U.K. public policy lead at Chainalysis, told CNBC. Sunak could seek to align different U.K. regulators' efforts to police crypto, something President Joe Biden has pushed for in the U.S.While the British government has kept the door open to digital currencies, officials at independent regulators have taken harsher tone on the sector.Another way Sunak could boost crypto in the U.K. is by advancing the Bank of England's work on exploring a central bank digital currency.In April 2021, Sunak's finance department launched a joint taskforce with the central bank looking into the feasibility of a token recognized as equivalent to the British pound. It's been dubbed ""Britcoin,"" though it likely wouldn't look anything like bitcoin, which is decentralized and volatile.""We may now see an acceleration on the work being done on those proposals — one to watch in the next few months,"" Varun Paul, CBDC and market infrastructure director at crypto software firm Fireblocks, told CNBC.The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and other central banks are considering their own digital currencies. But China holds the lead in the CBDC race, with a digital version of the yuan already being actively tested in numerous provinces.More than anything, crypto investors want to see Sunak give the industry some clarity. In the U.S., the government issued a framework for crypto. And the European Union has approved a sweeping set of laws governing the sector. The U.K. has its Financial Services and Markets Bill, which aims to make the country's financial sector more competitive post-Brexit. It's currently doing the rounds in parliamentary votes but, once passed, would recognize crypto assets as regulated products.""One would expect the path to regulatory clarity to be significantly shorter with [Sunak] at the helm,"" said Martin Hiesboeck, head of blockchain and crypto research at trading platform Uphold, in an emailed comment."
2022-11-01,"If you're dreaming of combining your cryptocurrency investments with your retirement savings, you're not alone.Nearly 50% of Gen Z and millennial employees wish they could invest in cryptocurrency via their 401(k) retirement plan, according to Charles Schwab's ""2022 401(k) Plan Participant Study,"" which surveyed 1,000 401(k) plan participants between the ages of 21 and 70 who work for companies with at least 25 employees and currently contribute to their company's 401(k) plan.""They are questioning traditional approaches to both work and retirement,"" Catherine Golladay, head of Schwab workplace financial services, said in a press release. ""The 401(k), while still their primary retirement savings tool, is no longer viewed as their only path to retirement.""For some investors, it's already possible to invest in cryptocurrency via a 401(k).Fidelity Investments, which manages the employee retirement benefits programs for nearly 23,000 businesses, has given companies the ability to offer employees the option to invest in bitcoin through dedicated ""digital assets accounts."" If an employer offers this option, employees can invest up to 20% of their 401(k)s in bitcoin.However, just because the option is available doesn't mean it's a good fit for your retirement strategy.""There's no underlying fundamental value to cryptocurrency,"" says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. ""It's neither time tested nor proven as a sustainable wealth creator.""Adding cryptocurrency to your retirement portfolio may drag down its overall performance, McBride adds.That's because, typically, you would diversify your portfolio by spreading your investment dollars across multiple financial assets, such as stocks and bonds. This helps to reduce the volatility of your portfolio since you're not overly invested in one specific type of asset.But cryptocurrency is a highly volatile asset, subject to erratic fluctuations and falls in value, which means it could increase your portfolio's volatility rather than reducing it.Given the unpredictable nature of the crypto market, the U.S. Department of Labor has warned companies that manage 401(k) plans to ""exercise extreme care before including direct investment options in cryptocurrency.""In addition to crypto, younger generations are interested in investing in a wide array of options via their 401(k)s, including annuities, which offer guaranteed income in retirement, according to Schwab's survey. However, it's important to note that annuities can come with a number of downsides for investors, such as costly fees and restricted access to your money.""They recognize the value in speculative assets but also recognize the value of guaranteed income as they approach retirement,"" says Nathan Voris, director of investments, insights and consultant services at Schwab retirement plan services.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: From Whole Foods to Gamestop, here are 5 retailers that accept crypto—but there’s a catch"
2022-11-01,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury on Tuesday announced Series I savings bonds — also known simply as I bonds — will pay a 6.89% annual interest rate through April 2023, down from the 9.62% the paid to those who purchased from May through the end of October.It's the third-highest rate since I bonds debuted in 1998, but that may feel like a bit of a consolation prize for those who attempted to lock in the 9.62% rate last-minute. Investor traffic flooded and ultimately crashed TreasuryDirect — the site that exclusively sells these bonds — in the days leading up to the interest rate change, which occurs every six months.But if you missed out, all is not lost. In fact, buying these bonds could still be a wise choice for you, even at the lower rate, says Naveen Neerukonda, a certified financial planner with PVA Financial in Chicago, Illinois.""[I bonds] could still be a good investment for the short- to medium-term,"" he says. ""Even though most people expect inflation to come down, they still offer attractive yield given their nearly risk-free nature.""Here's what you need to know. A quick refresher on I bonds: These inflation-adjusted bonds pay a fixed rate throughout the life of a bond coupled with an inflation rate pegged to the consumer price index. The latter adjusts each November and May. Whenever you buy, you'll lock in the current rate for six months.Unlike other bonds, I bonds aren't available to buy and sell on the secondary market, so their value won't fluctuate based on investor demand or movements in interest rates. Typically, bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions.And because these bonds are issued by the U.S. government, they carry very little risk of defaulting. Historically, Uncle Sam has yet to welch on his debts.Taking that into consideration, I bonds' 6.89% yield looks plenty healthy. You'll earn 4.27% on a similarly risk-free 5-year U.S. Treasury. And if you're willing to take on the associated risks risks, you'll find a 4.98% yield on an index tracking the broad U.S. bond market.  Before you invest, it's important to be aware of a few rules that come with investing in I bonds. The biggest red flag for short-term investors: You can't redeem these bonds for a year after you purchase them, and you'll owe a penalty equal to three months' interest if you cash out any time over the first five years of owning the bond.That means you'd be wise to avoid sinking cash into I bonds unless you have a well-funded emergency fund, says Neerukonda. ""If there is any chance you need this money within the next 12 to 15 months, then you need to think very cautiously about this,"" he recently told CNBC Make It. You can generally buy no more than $10,000 worth of I bonds per person per calendar year, though you can buy an additional $5,000 worth using money from your tax refund if you file Form 8888.And remember that website that was crashing in late October? That's still the only place to buy I bonds, and even when the site is up and running, it's no picnic, Bret Stephens, a CFP with AdvicePoint in Wilmington, North Carolina, previously told Make It.

2022-11-02,"Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said he was ""a little surprised"" when he heard Musk had agreed to acquire Twitter after all.Binance is now one of Twitter's equity backers, kicking in $500 million to help Musk buy the company.Speaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Zhao said he was unbothered by Musk's attempts to wriggle his way out of the deal.  LISBON, Portugal — The boss of crypto exchange Binance says he wasn't privy to Elon Musk's thinking when the billionaire backed away from, and then revived, his takeover of Twitter.Speaking on stage at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal, Changpeng Zhao said he was ""a little surprised"" when he heard Musk had agreed to acquire the company after all.Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, is now one of Twitter's equity backers, kicking in $500 million to help Musk buy the company. Zhao has expressed his hopes to bring Twitter into ""Web3,"" a term the technology industry uses to describe the next generation of the internet.""It's very hard to predict what Elon will do next,"" Zhao, who goes by ""CZ"" online, told the audience on the opening night of Web Summit Tuesday. ""The deal was on, the deal was off, the deal was on. It's OK, we're committed on our support."" ""For me, large deals like this, there's so many different factors involved. I'm not directly involved in what he's thinking ... There's so many different little things that could go one way or another, negotiations, changes of minds.""Zhao added that he wasn't bothered by Musk's attempts to wriggle his way out of the takeover.""When we invest in a deal, we're very comfortable if the deal goes through, we're very comfortable if the deal doesn't go through,"" he said.The ""number one reason"" for him to buy the social media firm was to make it a ""free speech platform,"" he said.The protracted saga over Musk's purchase of Twitter drew to a close last month when Musk agreed to a final deal with the company.Having initially reversed his decision to buy the company due to concerns over suspicious accounts, he subsequently made a renewed offer, in large part to avoid a contentious legal battle with company management, which sued to force him to buy it after he backed out.He has since dissolved the Twitter board, fired some of its top executives and made himself the CEO. Musk is already discussing plans to improve the platform's monetization efforts, including adding a fee for verified users. Initial reports suggested he would charge users $20 for a ""blue tick"" badge on their profiles, but his latest tweets suggest he is leaning toward $8 instead.Zhao said he had heard of Musk's desire to introduce a fee for verification badges but wasn't aware of the latest developments.""Elon Musk's probably a hard guy for me to predict,"" he said. ""I'm not the CEO of Twitter. We're an investor in Twitter but I'm not running it.""Zhao added he shared Musk's desire to promote free speech on the platform and purge it of bots and suspicious accounts. ""Twitter is the global town square,"" he said."
2022-11-02,"Kathleen Breitman told CNBC's Karen Tso that ""easy money"" from venture capitalist profit-seeking and low interest rates had artificially inflated the valuations of many crypto firms.Even if the Fed pauses rate hikes next year, only the ""small minority"" of crypto applications that are truly useful and can organically grow users will thrive, she said. The ongoing crypto winter is ""only going to get worse"" as the industry recalibrates to a higher interest rate world, according to the co-founder of blockchain platform Tezos.Asked about the fall in price of many crypto assets this year, Kathleen Breitman said: ""A lot of this was inflated on cheap money, and a lot of this was backed by basically, like, VCs trying to pump.""""There was a lot of easy money going into the system and I think it was artificially stoking a number of different things, mainly valuations of these companies,"" she told CNBC's Karen Tso Wednesday at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal.Breitman cited NFT marketplace OpenSea, where trading volume plunged from $2.9 billion in September 2021 to $349 million in September 2022, according to data from Dune Analytics.""Clearly there is a phenomenon that has kind of crested and gone away in a lot of these markets, but meanwhile they're saddled with a $13 billion valuation,"" Breitman said. ""So I think there's a lot of cheap money that went in, valuations went super sky high, you had people scrambling to make those valuations justified in some form, usually through cheap tactics like yield farming, and now that the easy money's gone away, all that's left is we're getting communities, I hope,"" she continued.On whether the pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes that economists expect next year could see crypto markets rally, Breitman said there would still be a shift in crypto and tech valuations being based on anticipatory benefits to actual user growth; and without the ability to keep using ""cheap tactics"" to get ""easy come, easy go"" users in the door.""Crypto hasn't been evaluated by that metric, and neither has technology in the last 10 years that we've had low interest rates,"" Breitman told CNBC. ""It remains to be seen, but basically I think what you'll find is the things that are useful are going to thrive.""""But that's the small minority of crypto applications, whether people want to admit it or not."" Tezos, which Breitman co-founded, is a smart contract platform, like the better-known Ethereum, but that allows token holders to vote on changes to the platform before they are enacted every few months.Usage of the network has increased on 2021, Breitman said, driven by demand from the art world, where digital artists are minting art on the blockchain and trading it. This use is providing one of the only sources of organic growth in the industry more broadly, she said.The notion of the end of the era of easy money in crypto is one that analysts have been discussing in recent months amid the downturn.Some industry figures believe the recent relative price stabilization of assets such as bitcoin, which has been trading between $18,000 and $25,000 for the last four months after experiencing massive volatility, is positive for the industry.Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, previously told CNBC bitcoin's performance was ""a strong sign that the digital assets market has matured and is becoming less fragmented.""

SINGAPORE – Co-founder and CEO of U.S.-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, said that Singapore wants to be a forward-looking regulator, but is not welcoming toward crypto trading. The city-state has repeatedly warned that cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and volatile after many retail investors lost large chunks of their savings. It has also banned crypto advertising in public areas and on social media.""Singapore wants to be a Web3 hub, and then simultaneously say: 'Oh, we're not really going to allow retail trading or self-hosted wallets to be available,"" said Armstrong at the Singapore FinTech Festival 2022. He was speaking alongside Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. ""Those two things are incompatible in my mind, and I would like to see Singapore embrace retail trading and self-hosted wallets,"" Armstrong added.It comes after Coinbase received in-principle approval from MAS to offer digital payment token services in the city-state.  So far, Singapore has only handed out 17 in-principle approvals and licenses after a strict selection process following 180 applications.

There should be anti-money-laundering protections. There should be audits that they need to complete, no commingling of funds, appropriate disclosures to customers,"" said Armstrong.""Crypto should not be treated at a disadvantage; they should be treated equally with other financial service regulations."" In response, Mohanty gave an analogy of a customer using a banking app. ""We, as the regulator, don't worry about internet protocols. We only care about the customers who went to the bank. The bank is responsible to ensure that they protect their customers,"" he added.""MAS has stated quite clearly our position on where the real value in the crypto industry comes from,"" a spokesperson for MAS told CNBC in response to a request for further comment.In his opening address at the Singapore FinTech Festival 2022, MAS Managing Director Ravi Menon said, ""If a crypto hub is about experimenting with programmable money, applying digital assets for use cases or tokenizing financial assets to increase efficiency and reduce risk in financial transactions, yes, we want to be a crypto hub.

2022-11-04,"Fidelity Investments, the largest 401(k) administrator by assets, began offering a bitcoin fund to workers this fall. ForUsAll started offering six cryptocurrencies to workers in recent weeks.The companies appear to be the first administrators of 401(k) and similar workplace plans to offer crypto.The U.S. Department of Labor has cautioned employers against offering the asset class due to risks like speculation and volatility. Retirement savers in some 401(k) plans are starting to get access to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.Fidelity Investments, the largest provider of 401(k) plans by total assets, began offering a Digital Assets Account to clients this fall, a spokesperson confirmed.Employers sponsoring a 401(k) plan through Fidelity can choose to offer the account to workers, allowing them to allocate a share of their savings to bitcoin.For its part, ForUsAll, a plan administrator geared toward startups and small businesses, in September also rolled out crypto to 401(k) savers, said David Ramirez, the company's CEO.Investors can buy into six cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, ethereum, solana, polkadot, cardano and USDC. ForUsAll intends to add five more in the coming weeks, said Ramirez, who declined to disclose which ones.More from Personal Finance:How your credit score affects car financing26 million borrowers have applied for student loan forgivenessFidelity is the latest employer to offer free college education to workersThe firms appear to be the first administrators to make crypto available as 401(k) investment options.The moves come as the U.S. Department of Labor in March urged employers to ""exercise extreme care"" before giving workers exposure to cryptocurrency. The regulator cited ""significant risks"" for investors, such as speculation and volatility.Meanwhile, investor interest in crypto spiked amid record growth in 2021. But prices have since plunged in what some have taken to calling a ""crypto winter."" Bitcoin, for example, has lost more than 66% of its value from its high point in November last year. (For comparison, the S&P 500 Index is down about 20% in the past year.) Bitcoin's current price, around $21,000 a coin, is almost triple its value from the beginning of 2020, and the S&P 500 is up about 17% over that time.Fidelity declined to disclose how many clients have opted to offer the bitcoin account to workers.Fifty ForUsAll clients have made crypto available to employees, and an additional 100 clients are expected to join soon, Ramirez said. Those 150 plans would represent about 27% to 28% of total clients. Ramirez estimated 70% to 80% of new clients have been asking to make crypto available.""Our core goal has always been to provide equal access to wealth creation,"" Ramirez said. ""We just didn't feel it was fair Americans would be left behind in the 401(k)."" At a technical level, Fidelity and ForUsAll offer crypto to investors in different ways.Fidelity's bitcoin account is one option that sits alongside other 401(k) investments like traditional stock and bond funds. The Digital Asset Account holds bitcoin and short-term, cash-like investments, which are meant to help facilitate daily transactions.ForUsAll's is part of a ""brokerage window,"" essentially a portal through which investors can gain access to dozens of additional investments that aren't technically part of the core 401(k) options.ForUsAll intends to make alternative asset classes like private equity, venture capital and real estate available through the window in the future, too, Ramirez said. Fidelity and ForUsAll have installed certain guardrails to limit investors' overall 401(k) allocations to crypto. For example, ForUsAll limits investor allocations to 5% of their current portfolio balance and sends investor alerts if that share exceeds 5% in the future. Investors, meanwhile, can't put more than 20% of their balance into Fidelity's offering, though employers can choose to lower that cap.But employers may not be so quick to make cryptocurrency or alternative asset classes available to workers due to legal risk, experts said. Workers and other parties have brought multiple lawsuits against companies over the past decade-plus over allegedly risky and costly 401(k) funds.ForUsAll sued the Labor Department over its cryptocurrency compliance bulletin issued in March. That case is yet unresolved."
2022-11-05,"Once known for its stable and investment-friendly banking system, Lebanon has plunged into chaos as hyperinflation grips the country and banks force huge haircuts on dollar withdrawals.To make ends meet in a financial system that no longer makes sense, some Lebanese are mining bitcoin or storing wealth using the cryptocurrency.The dollar-pegged stablecoin tether, which users trade for cash, is also popular. When Georgio Abou Gebrael first heard about bitcoin in 2016, it sounded like a scam.But by 2019, as Lebanon plunged into a financial crisis following decades of expensive wars and bad spending decisions, a decentralized and borderless digital currency operating outside the reach of bankers and politicians sounded a lot like salvation. Gebrael was an architect living in his hometown of Beit Mery, a village eleven miles due east of Beirut. He had lost his job and needed to figure out another way to quickly get ahold of cash. In the spring of 2020, Gebrael says, the banks were closed and locals were barred from withdrawing money from their accounts. Receiving cash via international wire transfer wasn't a great option either, since these services would take U.S. dollars from the sender and give Lebanese pounds to the recipient at a much lower rate than market value, according to the 27-year-old. ""I would lose around half of the value,"" explained Gebrael of the experience. ""That's why I was looking at bitcoin – it was a good way to get money from abroad."" Gebrael discovered a subreddit dedicated to connecting freelancers with employers willing to pay in bitcoin. The architect's first job was to film a short commercial for a company that sold tires. Gebrael was paid $5 in bitcoin. Despite the tiny amount, he was hooked. Today, half of Gebrael's income is from freelance work, 90% of which is paid in bitcoin. The other half comes from a U.S. dollar-denominated salary paid by his new architecture firm. Beyond being a convenient way to earn a living, bitcoin has also become his bank.""When I get paid from my architecture job, I withdraw all my money,"" continued Gebrael. He then uses that cash to buy small amounts of bitcoin every Saturday. The rest he keeps as spending money for daily needs and home renovations. Gebrael isn't alone in seeking alternative ways to earn, save, and spend money in Lebanon – a country whose banking system is fundamentally broken after decades of mismanagement. The local currency has lost more than 95% of its value since Aug. 2019, the minimum wage has effectively plummeted from $450 to $17 a month, pensions are virtually worthless, Lebanon's triple-digit inflation rate is expected to be second only to Sudan this year, and bank account balances are just numbers on paper.""Not everyone believes that the banks are bankrupt, but the reality is that they are,"" said Ray Hindi, CEO of a Zurich-based management firm dedicated to digital assets.

In the meantime, Gebrael is covering the difference. Others have lost faith in the monetary system altogether. Enter cryptocurrency.CNBC spoke with multiple locals, many of whom consider cryptocurrencies a lifeline for survival. Some are mining for digital tokens as their sole source of income while they hunt for a job. Others arrange clandestine meetings via Telegram to swap the stablecoin tether for U.S. dollars in order to buy groceries. Although the form that crypto adoption takes varies depending upon the person and the circumstances, nearly all of these locals craved a connection to money that actually makes sense.""Bitcoin has really given us hope,"" Gebrael said. ""I was born in my village, I've lived here my whole life, and bitcoin has helped me to stay here."" Between the end of the second World War and the start of Lebanon's civil war in 1975, Beirut was in its golden age, earning it the title of ""the Paris of the Middle East."" The world's elite flocked to the Lebanese capital, which boasted a sizable Francophone population, Mediterranean seaside cafes, and a banking sector known for its resilience and emphasis on secrecy.Even after the brutal 15-year civil war ended in 1990, Lebanon competed with offshore banking jurisdictions such as Switzerland and the Cayman Islands as an ideal destination for the rich to park their cash. Lebanese banks offered both a certain degree of anonymity and interest rates ranging from highs of 15% to 31% on U.S. dollars, according to one estimate shared by Dan Azzi, an economist and former CEO of the Lebanese subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank. In return, Lebanon drew in the foreign currencies that it so desperately needed to re-stock its coffers after the civil war.There were strings attached. Some banks, for example, had a lock-up window of three years and steep minimum balance requirements. But for a while, the system worked pretty well for everyone involved. The banks got an influx of cash, depositors saw their balances swiftly grow, and the government went on an undisciplined spending spree with the money it borrowed from the banks. The mirage of easy money was further reinforced by the government putting some of that borrowed cash toward maintaining a fixed exchange rate for deposit inflows at an overvalued peg.Tourism and international aid, plus foreign direct investment from oil-rich Gulf states, also went a long way toward shoring up the balance sheet of the central bank, Banque du Liban. The country's brain drain and the subsequent boom in remittance payments sent home by the Lebanese diaspora injected dollars as well. World Bank data shows remittances as a percentage of gross domestic product peaked at more than 26% in 2004, though it stayed high through the 2008 global financial crisis. Those payments, however, began to slow through the 2010s amid unrest throughout the region, and the growing prominence of Hezbollah – an Iranian-backed, Shiite political party and militant group – in Lebanon alienated some of the country's biggest donors.  Meanwhile, as the government splurged to try and rebuild from the civil war, the government's budget deficit plunged further into the red, and its imports have far outstripped its exports for years.To try to stave off a total economic meltdown, in 2016, central bank chief Riad Salameh, an ex-Merrill Lynch banker who had been on the job since the early 1990s, decided to dial up banking incentives. People willing to deposit U.S. dollars earned astronomical interest on their money, which proved especially compelling at a time when returns elsewhere in the world were relatively underwhelming. El Chamaa tells CNBC that those who deposited U.S. dollars and then converted those dollars to Lebanese lira earned the highest interest.The era of easy money fell off a cliff in October 2019, when the government proposed a flurry of taxation on everything from gas, to tobacco, to WhatsApp calls. People took to the streets in what became known as the October 17 Revolution.As the masses revolted, the government defaulted on its sovereign debt for the first time ever in early 2020, just as the Covid pandemic took hold around the world. Making a terrible situation worse, in Aug. 2020, an explosion of a stockpile of ammonium nitrate stored at the port in Beirut – blamed on gross government negligence – killed more than 200 people and cost the city billions of dollars in damages.  The banks, spooked by all the chaos, first limited withdrawals and then shut their doors entirely as much of the world descended into lockdown. Hyperinflation took root. The local currency, which had a peg of 1,500 Lebanese pounds to $1 for 25 years, began to rapidly depreciate. The street rate is now around 40,000 pounds to $1. ""You need a backpack to go for lunch with a group of people,"" explained Hindi.After re-opening, the banks refused to keep up with this extreme depreciation, and offered much lower exchange rates for U.S. dollars than they were worth on the open market. So money in the bank was suddenly worth much less.Azzi dubbed this new form of money ""lollars,"" referring to U.S. dollars deposited into the Lebanese banking system before 2019. Today, withdrawals of lollars are capped, and each lollar is paid out at a rate worth about 15% of its actual value, according to estimates from multiple locals and experts living across Lebanon.Meanwhile, banks still offer the full market-rate exchange rate for U.S. dollars deposited after 2019. These are now known colloquially as ""fresh dollars.""For many Lebanese, this was the point at which money just stopped making sense. ""I send actual dollars from my dollar account in Switzerland to my dad's Lebanese account,"" Hindi told CNBC. ""They count as fresh dollars because it came from abroad, but of course, my dad is running counterparty risk with the bank.""Mohamad El Chamaa, a 27-year-old Beirut-based journalist at L'Orient Today tells CNBC that when the bank began instituting these restrictions, he had $3,000 in his savings account from odd jobs he did in grad school.""One of my life's regrets was not withdrawing my money in full before the crisis hit,"" said El Chamaa, who is studying for a Masters in Urban Planning at the American University of Beirut. ""I could see the writing on the wall, because the bank started charging me a small percentage for every dollar withdrawal I made a month before the crisis hit, which I thought was kind of odd.""El Chamaa says that he has since grown accustomed to withdrawing money from his bank account at a ""bad rate"" of 10% to 15% of its original worth, but ""there is no way in hell"" he would ever deposit cash in a Lebanese bank ever again. Instead, he keeps what remains of his life savings in cash and just uses his bank account to pay for his iCloud service and music streaming account.  Access to his account is spotty. The banks closed again in September, and there are daily nationwide power cuts, which translate to limited ATM access.Bank heists in which locals demand money from their personal accounts by force are the new norm. Some have brandished a toy gun and a hunting rifle, while others have taken hostages in an effort to access their savings to pay hospital bills. The assailants include a Member of the Lebanese Parliament who demanded her frozen savings for medical expenses and a former Lebanese ambassador. ""It gets worse over time, but the fundamentals have been bad since 2019. They haven't changed that much,"" said Hindi.The World Bank says Lebanon's economic and financial crisis is among the worst it's seen anywhere on the planet since the 1850s. The United Nations estimates that 78% of the Lebanese population has now fallen below the poverty line.Goldman Sachs analysts estimate losses at the local banks are around $65 billion to $70 billion – a figure that is four times the country's entire GDP. Fitch projects inflation rising to 178% this year – worse than in both Venezuela and Zimbabwe – and there are conflicting messages from the government's top brass as to whether the country is officially bankrupt.The International Monetary Fund is in talks with Lebanon to put a big bandaid over the whole mess. The global lender is considering extending a $3 billion lifeline – with a lot of conditions attached. Meanwhile, there is a power vacuum as Parliament keeps trying and failing to elect a president.  A little over two years ago, Ahmad Abu Daher and his friend began mining ether with three machines running on hydroelectric power in Zaarouriyeh, a town 30 miles south of Beirut in the Chouf Mountains.At the time, ethereum — the blockchain underpinning the ether token — operated on a proof-of-work model, in which miners around the world would run high-powered computers that crunched math equations in order to validate transactions and simultaneously create new tokens. This is how the bitcoin network is still secured today.The process requires expensive equipment, some technical know-how, and a lot of electricity. Because miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is energy, they are driven to migrate to the world's cheapest sources of power.Abu Daher taps into a hydropower project which harnesses electricity from the 90-mile Litani River that cuts across southern Lebanon. He says he is getting 20 hours a day of electricity at old pre-inflationary rates.""So basically, we are paying very cheap electricity, and we are getting fresh dollars through mining,"" continued Abu Daher. When 22-year-old Abu Daher saw that his mining venture was profitable, he and his friend expanded the operation.They built their own farm with rigs acquired at fire sale prices from miners in China and began re-selling and repairing mining equipment for others. They also started to host rigs for people living across Lebanon, who needed stable money but lacked the technical expertise, as well as the access to cheap and steady electricity — a highly coveted commodity in a country with crippling electricity blackouts. Abu Daher also has customers outside of Lebanon, in Syria, Turkey, France, and the United Kingdom.It has been 26 months since they first set up shop, and business is thriving, according to Abu Daher. He says that he had profits of $20,000 in September — half from mining, half from selling machines and trading in crypto.The government, facing electrical shortages, is trying to crack down.In Jan., police raided a small crypto mining farm in the hydro-powered town of Jezzine, seizing and dismantling mining rigs in the process. Soon after, the Litani River Authority, which oversees the country's hydroelectric sites, reportedly said that ""energy intensive cryptomining"" was ""straining its resources and draining electricity.""But Abu Daher tells CNBC he is neither worried about being raided — nor the government's proposal to hike up the price of electricity. ""We had some meetings with the police, and we don't have any problems with them, because we are taking legal electricity, and we are not affecting the infrastructure,"" he said.Whereas Abu Daher says that he has set up a meter that officially tracks how much energy his machines have consumed, other miners have allegedly hitched their rigs to the grid illegally and are not paying for power.""Basically, a lot of other persons are having some issues, because they are not paying for electricity, and they are affecting the infrastructure,"" he said.Rawad El Hajj, a 27-year-old with a marketing degree, found out about Abu Daher's mining operation three years ago through his brother.""We started because there is not enough work in Lebanon,"" El Hajj said of his motivation to jump into mining.El Hajj, who lives south of the capital in a city called Barja, began small, purchasing two miners to start.""Then every month, we started to go bigger and bigger,"" El Hajj told CNBC. Because of the distance to Abu Daher's farms, El Hajj pays to outsource the work of hosting and maintaining the rigs. He tells CNBC that his 11 machines mine for litecoin and dogecoin, which collectively bring in the equivalent of about .02 bitcoin a month, or $426.It's a similar story for Salah Al Zaatare, an architect living 20 minutes south of El Hajj in the coastal city of Sidon. Al Zaatare tells CNBC that he began mining dogecoin and litecoin in March of this year to augment his income. He now has 10 machines that he keeps with Abu Daher. Al Zaatare's machines are newer models so he pulls in more than El Hajj — about $8,500 a month.Al Zaatare pulled all of his money out of the bank before the crisis hit in 2019, and he held onto that cash until deciding to invest his life savings into mining equipment last year.""I got into it, because I think it will become a good investment for the future,"" Al Zaatare told CNBC.Official government data shows that just 3% of those earning a living in Lebanon are paid in a foreign currency such as the U.S. dollar, so mining offers a rare opportunity to get ahold of fresh dollars.""If you can get the machine, and you get the power, you get the money,"" said Nicholas Shafer, a University of Oxford academic studying Lebanon's crypto mining industry.Abu Daher, who graduated from the American University of Beirut six months ago, has also been experimenting with other ways to get more use out of crypto mining. As part of his year-end project at university, he designed a system to harness the heat from the miners as a means to keep homes and hospitals warm during the winter months.But mining crypto tokens to earn a living is not for everybody.Gebrael considered it, but ultimately, the cost of buying gear, plus paying for electricity, cooling, and maintenance seemed like a roundabout way of getting what he wanted.""It's easier to just buy bitcoin,"" he said. When Gebrael needs cash to pay for groceries and other basics, he first uses a service called FixedFloat to swap some of the bitcoin he has earned through his freelance work for tether (also known as USDT), a stablecoin that is pegged to the U.S. dollar. After that, he goes to one of two Telegram groups to arrange a trade of tether for U.S. dollars. While tether does not offer the same potential for appreciation as other cryptocurrencies, it represents something more important: a currency that Lebanese still trust.Each week, Gebrael finds someone willing to make the swap, and they set up an in-person meeting. Because he is often making the trade with a stranger, Gebrael typically chooses public spaces, like a coffee shop, or the ground floor of a residential building.""One time I was scared because it was at night and the person I contacted asked me to go up to their apartment,"" Gebrael said of one hand-off. ""I asked them to come meet me on the street, and it all went fine. I try to stay as safe as possible.""These kinds of backchannels have become a critical lifeline to fresh dollars, which are vital in Lebanon's mostly-cash economy.""It's easy here to get cash from crypto,"" said El Hajj of his experience. ""There's a lot of guys that exchange USDT for cash.""Exchanges over the Telegram group that Gebrael uses range from $30 to trades in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.In addition to Telegram, a network of over-the-counter traders specialize in swapping several different types of fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies. The model bears resemblance to the centuries-old hawala system – which facilitates cross-border transactions via a sophisticated network of money exchangers and personal contacts. Abu Daher offers exchange services in tandem with his mining business, and charges a 1% commission fee to both of the parties participating in the trade.  ""We started by selling and buying USDT because the amount of demand on USDT is very high,"" said Abu Daher, who added that he was ""shocked"" at the flood of inbounds for his service.Some people are tinkering with covering their daily expenses in tether directly to avoid either paying commissions to crypto exchangers — or having to go through the motions of setting up an informal trade with a stranger. Even though accepting crypto as a payment method is prohibited under Lebanese law, businesses are actively advertising that they accept crypto payments on Instagram and other social media platforms.""The use of USDT is widespread. There's a lot of coffee shops, restaurants, and electronics stores that accept USDT as a payment, so that's convenient if I need to spend not in fiat, but from my bitcoin savings,"" explained Gebrael. ""The government has much bigger problems right now than to worry about some stores accepting cryptocurrency.""Local businesses in the Chouf region have also begun to accept crypto payments amid the rise of mining farms, according to El Chamaa. In Sidon, the 26-year-old owner of a restaurant called Jawad Snack says that around 30% of his transactions are in crypto, according to written comments translated by Abu Daher and shared with CNBC via WhatsApp.""It's better for me to accept tether or U.S. dollars due to the huge inflation in the Lebanese lira,"" continued the owner, who added that once he is paid in tether, he cashes it out to fiat through a trader in the black market. He says he typically uses Abu Daher for this, since he lives the closest.Abu Daher uses tether to pay for imported machines, but he still has to cover a lot of his expenses in the Lebanese lira (electricity, internet fees, and rent), as well as in U.S. dollars (cooling systems and security systems).Some hotels and tourism agencies accept tether, as does at least one auto mechanic living in Sidon. Indeed, new research from blockchain data firm Chainalysis shows that Lebanon's crypto transaction volume is up about 120%, year-over-year, and it ranks second only to Turkey in terms of the volume of cryptocurrency received among countries in the Middle East and North Africa. (Globally, it's in 56th place in peer-to-peer trading volume.)Access to a smartphone is critical, too. Although official statistics show that internet penetration in Lebanon is around 80%, the country's debilitating power cuts disrupt internet service. But the country's telecom networks operate their own power generators to keep running continuously.""We are putting our money in our phones. That is the easiest way,"" said Abu Daher. In 2017, Marcel Younes was working as a marketing manager with Pfizer in Beirut when he tried to get rich by getting into bitcoin.A pharmacist by training, Younes soon strayed from tracking price charts and instead became engrossed by the economic theory underpinning digital currencies like bitcoin.As he continued his studies, he noticed a lot of similarities between Lebanon, Venezuela, and Argentina.""I panicked and withdrew all my money from the bank,"" said Younes, who added that he emptied his account in mid-2019 — just a couple months before banks locked people out of their accounts. ""I was paranoid thanks to bitcoin.""Younes tells CNBC that he initially moved 15% of his money into bitcoin, and he kept the remaining balance in cash. Today, 70% of his cash is in bitcoin.""I was actually telling everyone to do the same in my family, like, please try to withdraw some money, and don't keep it in the bank,"" said Younes.""But no one really believes a pharmacist — a person who is not related to our banking system,"" said Younes. Younes, who was born in Poland but moved to Lebanon with his family in 1998, tells CNBC that most of his family works in the banking system in Lebanon.""They always believe that everything is fine with the banking system, so you get this confidence that everything is alright,"" he said.Within months, his family was wiped out.His father-in-law, who is 75 years old and retired years ago, had safeguarded his entire net worth in the bank.""My family, like every single family member in Lebanon, got really hurt by the whole devaluation and currency crisis,"" said Younes.A by-product of the spiraling currency has been the erosion of earning power.""My aunt, for example, she's a teacher. Right now, her salary is $50 per month. My father, who's a doctor with over 30 years of experience, his salary is around $500 a month,"" explained Younes. ""It happened gradually, because every few months, we have a small devaluation, and it all culminated in a 95% devaluation of the Lebanese lira.""Younes has since founded Bitcoin du Liban (a play on the name of Lebanon's central bank, Banque du Liban), a group with a mission to help close the knowledge gap on bitcoin in Lebanon through in-person meetings, online tutorials, and chats via the organization's Telegram group. Multiple sources tell CNBC that people across the country are afraid to put their money in the banks or store it in cash at home because of the risk of theft. Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation, says these kinds of situations are one clear value proposition for bitcoin.In bitcoin, one of the mantras is — ""not your keys, not your coins"" — meaning that rightful ownership of tokens comes through the custody of the passwords that enable the crypto to be moved out of the wallet.""If you had your money in the bank in Lebanon, it's all gone. Who knows how much of it you will ever see again. Meanwhile, bitcoin rises and falls in the global market, but if you self-custody your bitcoin, you always have it as an asset, and you can use it as you see fit and send it anywhere in the world,"" explained Gladstein. ""It has superpowers compared to fiat currency.""There are a lot of ways to store crypto coins. Online exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and PayPal will custody tokens for users. Abu Daher, for example, keeps 100% of his cash in online crypto wallets on Binance and KuCoin, as does Al Zaatare, who says that he saves his bitcoin on Binance.More tech-savvy users sometimes cut out the middleman and hold their crypto cash on personally owned hardware wallets. Gebrael, for example, prefers the autonomy and security that he derives from self-custody of his bitcoin. He tells CNBC that he keeps all of his bitcoin in cold storage on a thumb drive-sized device called a Trezor hardware wallet. Beyond the added security of holding his own keys and disconnecting his wallet from the internet, Gebrael says the appeal of cold storage has a lot to do with the fact that he doesn't have to connect his personal identity to his bitcoin. He added that the anonymity offered by self-custody helps protect him from being caught in the crosshairs of government-issued sanctions. Gebrael cited the example of the Canadian government blacklisting all crypto exchange wallets connected to the truckers participating in the 'Freedom Convoy' protests.Gebrael says he also doesn't like the user experience of centralized digital asset exchanges like Binance and Coinbase ""with all their flashy charts.""""It's like one huge casino, and they want you to gamble your money,"" said Gebrael.Lebanon has six bitcoin ATMs — one in Aamchit and five in Beirut, according to metrics offered by coinatmradar.com. But those who spoke with CNBC for this story say that the optimal on-ramps to accessing bitcoin are either earning it (through mining or paid work), or buying it with tether. When asked how reliable it is to safeguard wealth in an inherently volatile asset like bitcoin — which is down more than 70% in the last year — Younes says that ""it's a matter of perception.""""If you go back to two, three years ago, it was $3,500,"" said Younes, who added that he isn't really concerned about the price of bitcoin.When Younes first bought bitcoin, it was trading at about $20,000, so as of today, he tells CNBC that he hasn't made any money. But investing his cash into the world's largest cryptocurrency also has to do with the fact that he wants to bet on a new monetary system.""Bitcoin offers a system that is uncorruptible; a system that is basically permissionless and censorship-resistant,"" he said. ""No one can really devalue bitcoin due to its monetary policy, which is 21 million bitcoin.""Ultimately, money is a human belief system. For some in Lebanon, it has been a lifeline, for others, it's a passing fad.El Chamaa hasn't turned to crypto, and he stands by the decision, even after spending time reporting on the ground at Abu Daher's crypto mines.""If you look at what bitcoin and ethereum are worth today, I mean, it's worth a fraction of what it was a year ago. So I'm kind of glad I didn't get into it,"" said El Chamaa.""Warren Buffett is basically saying that it doesn't have an intrinsic value and just passing it on to the next person and helping to make a profit off of that doesn't make any sense. So I'm a bit skeptical,"" he said."

2022-11-07,"James Zhong of Gainesville, Georgia, pleaded guilty to wire fraud in the theft of about $3.36 billion in bitcoin stolen from the illegal Silk Road marketplace, which the FBI shut down in 2013.This is the federal government's second-largest seizure of cryptocurrency, following the $3.6 billion in stolen crypto linked to the 2016 hack of Bitfinex. The U.S. Department of Justice announced Monday that it seized about $3.36 billion in stolen bitcoin during a previously unannounced 2021 raid on the residence of James Zhong.Zhong pleaded guilty Friday to one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.U.S. authorities seized about 50,676 bitcoin, then valued at over $3.36 billion, from Zhong during a search of his house in Gainesville, Georgia, on Nov. 9, 2021, the DOJ said. It is the DOJ's second-largest financial seizure to date, following its seizure of $3.6 billion in allegedly stolen cryptocurrency linked to the 2016 hack of the crypto exchange Bitfinex, which the DOJ announced in February.According to authorities, Zhong stole bitcoin from the illegal Silk Road marketplace, a dark web forum on which drugs and other illicit products were bought and sold with cryptocurrency. Silk Road was launched in 2011, but the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut it down in 2013. Its founder, Ross William Ulbricht, is now serving a life sentence in prison.""For almost ten years, the whereabouts of this massive chunk of missing Bitcoin had ballooned into an over $3.3 billion mystery,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a press release.According to the Southern District of New York, Zhong took advantage of the marketplace's vulnerabilities to execute the hack.Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher, of the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation, said Zhong used a ""sophisticated scheme"" to steal the bitcoin from Silk Road. According to the press release, in September 2012, Zhong created nine fraudulent accounts on Silk Road, funding each with between 200 and 2,000 bitcoin. He then triggered over 140 transactions in rapid succession, which tricked the marketplace's withdrawal-processing system to release approximately 50,000 bitcoin into his accounts. Zhong then transferred the bitcoin into a variety of wallet addresses all under his control. Through blockchain analysis and good old-fashioned police work, law enforcement and blockchain analytic experts was able to recover more than 50,000 bitcoin from Zhong. They even uncovered crypto stored on a computer submerged under blankets in a popcorn tin in a bathroom closet, according to the press release.Public records show Zhong was the president and CEO of a self-created company, JZ Capital LLC, which he registered in Georgia in 2014. According to his LinkedIn profile, his work there focused on ""investments and venture capital.""His profile also states he was a ""large early bitcoin investor with extensive knowledge of its inner workings"" and that he had software development experience in computer programming languages.Zhong's social media profiles include pictures of him on yachts, in front of airplanes, and at high-profile football games.But these types of hacks didn't end with the Silk Road's demise. Crypto platforms continue to be vulnerable to criminals.In October 2022, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, suffered a $570 million hack. The company said a bug in a smart contract enabled hackers to exploit a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub. As a result, the hackers withdrew the platform's native cryptocurrency, called BNB tokens.In March 2022, a different hacker found vulnerabilities in the decentralized finance platform Ronin Network and made off with more than $600 million — the largest hack to date. The private keys, which serve as passwords to protect cryptocurrency funds in wallets, were compromised.According to a Chainalysis report, $1.9 billion worth of cryptocurrency had been stolen in hacks of services through July 2022, compared with just under $1.2 billion at the same point in 2021. "

The markets usually do very well when that happens,"" said The Wealth Alliance's Seth Cohan. Overall, history shows markets tend to gain into year-end and up to 12 months following midterm elections as investors are relieved to get some clarity on future policy. One wild card would be if multiple races that could determine control of Congress are too close to call, an outcome that could weigh on markets Wednesday.""The financial market reaction to a Republican win should be muted, as the House outcome is already widely expected, and the Senate outcome makes less of a difference to policy outcomes if Republicans control the House,"" Goldman Sachs' Jan Hatzius wrote in a Monday note.""A surprise Democratic win in the House and Senate would likely weigh on equities, as market participants might expect additional corporate tax increases,"" Hatzius added.Stocks came off their highs Tuesday afternoon, with the Nasdaq down 0.9% at one point, amid a broader sell off in cryptocurrencies.

The market continues its rally even as inflation shows no signs of slowing, Avallone said. At the same time, the Fed hasn't shifted its tone or policy.

Heading into the new year, Mills views the debt limit as a potential issue that could move markets this time around.""The one caveat is, do Democrats try to get that done in the lame duck,"" he said.

A crypto selloff also weighed on markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 646.89 points, or about 1.95%, to 32,513.94. The decline was led by Disney, which fell 13.2% after the entertainment giant missed analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines. The S&P 500 shed 2.08% to 3,748.57, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.48% to 10,353.17. Stocks fell to session lows during Wednesday afternoon as the price of bitcoin dropped to a new bear market low. The declines occurred after crypto exchange Binance said it's backing out of plans to acquire its rival FTX, citing the results of a due diligence exam, as well as recent reports of mishandled customer funds and alleged U.S. agency investigations of FTX. The decision weighed on overall risk sentiment and dragged down the tech sector.The stock market came off of three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could end up with 222 seats, which would be a narrow majority.In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. A key Senate race in Georgia between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican former NFL player Herschel Walker will head to a Dec. 6 runoff, according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

But Gardner said a gridlock in federal government, which was widely expected leading up to Election Day, would likely make it harder to pass fiscal policy.That could pressure the Federal to adjust its policy on interest rate hikes accordingly if a recession takes place, he said.

Sacconaghi said the language around ""pushed"" out shipments was ""coy"" and didn't clarify whether shipments are just delayed or if demand is sliding.These concerns come as Apple is valued at a relative premium compared to other Big Tech names and consumer-focused companies more broadly, he said.Apple, like other pandemic winners, has dropped sharply this year along with the broader stock market.

2022-11-08,"As workplace 401(k) plan administrators such as Fidelity Investments and ForUsAll begin to offer cryptocurrency as an alternative investment asset to employee investors advisors urge caution.""As volatile as it is, it has the potential for huge upswings,"" said Ivory Johnson, a CFP and founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington.Many plans cap crypto at 5% of investments. The younger investors are, the more exposure to crypto financial advisors would agree to when it comes to retirement savings. Cryptocurrency is starting to pop up as an alternative asset class in some 401(k) plans. Retirement savers may be wondering if it's wise to invest.""Making it this easy and accessible has both pros and cons [for investors],"" said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and founder of Bone Fide Wealth in New York.Fidelity Investments and ForUsAll, which administer workplace retirement plans, began offering cryptocurrency such as bitcoin to 401(k) investors within the past few months. They appear to be the first companies to do so.However, that doesn't mean all 401(k) plans will offer crypto.Employers must use an administrator that grants access and then opt to make crypto available to workers. Some may hesitate after a U.S. Department of Labor warning this year to exercise ""extreme care"" before adding crypto alongside more traditional stocks and bonds funds.More from Personal Finance:This IRA deduction mistake may derail your tax breakHere's the tax bill for the $1.9 billion Powerball jackpot6 health insurance terms you need to know as open enrollment beginsThe regulator identified speculation and volatility, as well as the challenge for 401(k) investors to ""make informed investment decisions,"" among its primary concerns.""As volatile as it is, it has the potential for huge upswings,"" said Ivory Johnson, a CFP and founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington, referring to cryptocurrency.Bitcoin, for example, peaked a year ago at nearly $69,000, more than doubling from the start of 2021. Its current price, at around $21,000, is down 70% since then; the crypto market overall has lost $2 trillion in value from its peak.Despite that pullback, bitcoin prices have still nearly tripled since the beginning of 2020. Crypto's upside could benefit buy-and-hold investors, especially at a time when many Americans are behind on retirement savings, said Johnson, a member of CNBC's Advisor Council. The con: Most people make knee-jerk reactions and sell in the short term, he added.Unlike holding crypto in a taxable investment account, crypto returns don't incur capital-gains tax if and when investors sell their 401(k) crypto holdings, Johnson said.But crypto's upside carries greater risk, too.""You might be wrong,"" Johnson added of a speculative bet in crypto. ""People make decisions based on Twitter, they hear something that's compelling ... and they go all in and put 30% of their retirement money in bitcoin.""You've [potentially] made a bad situation exponentially worse,"" he said. Financial advisors recommend investors allocate only a small piece of their portfolio — generally no more than 5% — to crypto.Investors with savings outside their 401(k) plan should consider their crypto allocation as part of their overall investable net worth, said Boneparth, also a member of CNBC's Advisor Council.For example, someone with $50,000 in a 401(k) plan and $100,000 in a separate taxable brokerage account would generally allocate up to 5% of that $150,000 total to cryptocurrency, he said.A young investor in their 20s may be well-suited for a 5% allocation while someone in their 50s who's nearer to retirement age should likely scale back that exposure, Johnson said. Investors may need to rebalance their allocations over time as crypto outpaces or lags returns elsewhere in their portfolios.""The investment rules don't just go away just because there's a digital asset to invest in your account,"" Boneparth said. ""Risk and reward, that relationship never goes away.""Fidelity and ForUsAll have put some safeguards in place to try limiting exposure.For example, Fidelity disallows investors from putting more than 20% of their 401(k) savings into its Digital Asset Account, though employers can choose to reduce that cap. The account holds bitcoin and short-term, cash-like investments to help facilitate daily transactions. ForUsAll limits allocations to 5%. It offers six cryptocurrencies — bitcoin, ethereum, solana, polkadot, cardano and USDC — and soon intends to add more. Within the 50 or so retirement plans that have made crypto available, 12.5% of investors are investing and allocate 4% of their portfolio to crypto, on average.""To be at 0% [of your portfolio], you're likely going to be 100% wrong,"" said Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, in September at the Future Proof wealth festival in Huntington Beach, Calif.He also advised investors against putting a significant chunk of their portfolio in cryptocurrency. Investors shouldn't jump blindly into crypto just because it's available, financial advisors said. As with other investments, they should generally understand what they're buying.The Labor Department cautioned that employers may be sending the opposite message to investors by adding crypto alongside traditional funds.When employers offer crypto in a 401(k), ""they effectively tell the plan's participants that knowledgeable investment experts have approved the cryptocurrency option as a prudent option for plan participants,"" the agency wrote. ""This can easily lead plan participants astray and cause losses."" Investors who opt to save some retirement money in cryptocurrency are likely also best-suited by sticking with bitcoin and ethereum, at least for now, advisors said. These are the largest cryptocurrencies and it's ""exponentially more difficult"" to speculate with anything else, Boneparth said.""I think you'll see, more and more, bitcoin becoming a risk-on asset like stocks,"" he said.""We're seeing it mature,"" he added. ""There are many question marks that remain."""
2022-11-08,"Ahmad Abu Daher, 22, says he and his team of more than 40 Lebanese and Syrian employees are working around the clock to man thousands of machines across the country.He got into the business after graduating from university into an environment of financial chaos, as the country's banking system collapses and hyperinflation takes root.He's one of many Lebanese turning to crypto mining to stay afloat. It takes a lot to keep a grassroots cryptocurrency mining business up and running in Lebanon. Ahmad Abu Daher says he and his team of more than 40 Lebanese and Syrian employees are working around the clock to man thousands of machines across the country.""We can't sleep. We can't have any break,"" the 22-year-old Abu Daher told CNBC at 2:36 A.M. Lebanon time. ""All of my team are still awake. They don't sleep. Our shift is working 16 hours per day, and sometimes, up to 18 or 19 hours.""related investing newsFord's EV push has its skeptics. After Monday's investor day, Jim Cramer is still not one of themPaulina Likos12 hours agoAbu Daher's voice competes with the sound of machines whirring in the background, each crunching thousands of complicated math equations to produce a mix of crypto tokens – now a vital source of income in a country where money has stopped making sense. Lebanon once boasted a thriving and resilient banking sector that attracted the world's elite. But after decades of war, bad spending decisions by the government, and financial policies that the World Bank has compared to a Ponzi scheme, the country's economy is in ruin.See also: In bankrupt Lebanon, locals mine bitcoin and buy groceries with tether, as $1 is now worth 15 cents The local currency has lost more than 95% of its value since 2019, the minimum wage has plunged to $17 a month, pensions are virtually worthless, and bank account balances are just numbers on paper. Banks close without warning and ATMs are often either out of cash or entirely offline from nationwide blackouts. When locals are able to gain access to their accounts, many tell CNBC that they have grown accustomed to withdrawing money at 15% of its original worth. Against this backdrop, Abu Daher jumped into the crypto mining business a little over two years ago. He and a friend began with three machines running on hydroelectric power in Zaarouriyeh, a town 30 miles south of Beirut in the Chouf Mountains.""When we started, it was our great idea to make money while sleeping or eating,"" said Abu Daher. Nowadays, Abu Daher says he is online 20 hours a day.An architect by training, Abu Daher saw several other university students unable to find work after graduation, so he realized he had to be proactive, teaching himself various technical tasks by watching YouTube videos. It has been 26 months since Abu Daher first set up shop, and he says that business is thriving.He now has about 400 crypto farms with between 5 and 100 machines each, in 42 villages across the country running on a mix of hydropower, solar power, and fuel. Abu Daher says that he pulls in about $20,000 a month, and typically, half of those proceeds come from mining and the other half from selling machines and trading in crypto.When CNBC asked for crypto exchange statements and copies of bank balances to corroborate the estimate, Abu Daher said that the figure was pieced together from trading, mining, and selling machines, in a mix of transactions involving cash, checks, and tether, as well as multiple crypto wallets.Abu Daher certainly has the trappings of a mining baron.""When Ahmad pulled up in a white Range Rover to greet us and take us for a tour of the town, I was kind of impressed,"" said Mohamad El Chamaa, a journalist at L'Orient Today who previously reported on Abu Daher's crypto mines. ""I had known him before Covid when he was a college student at the architecture department and I was his TA. It looked like the crypto business was treating him well."" Abu Daher had a few black swan events on his side soon after he broke into crypto mining.In May 2021, China expelled crypto miners, flooding the market with cheap, used mining rigs and reducing competition. This happened as cryptocurrency prices climbed toward all-time record highs.As geopolitics permanently reshaped the landscape of the crypto mining industry, Abu Daher and his team began to build out their own farms across Lebanon with rigs acquired at fire sale prices from miners in China. Paying for those machines was not always straightforward.""Due to sanctions controls, difficulty with using cash, and specifically in Lebanon, the banking system and the inability to use dollars or wire money, USD tether is essentially a key intermediary currency between people in the Chinese hardware market to Lebanese purchasers,"" said Nicholas Shafer, a University of Oxford academic studying Lebanon's crypto mining industry. Abu Daher's farms span the country, with roughly half of his equipment in the hydro-rich Chouf range, and the remaining 50% scattered throughout Lebanon, including in the Beqaa Valley, which is close to the Syrian border, and offers solar power as an alternative electricity source. (Though, as Shafer notes, the problem with solar is capacity — solar typically does not produce enough megawatts to mine at scale.)Abu Daher also started to host rigs for people living across Lebanon, who needed stable money but lacked technical expertise and access to cheap and steady electricity, as the nation often experiences blackouts.The mining boss does appear to be sharing those profits with his team. Shafer, who conducted field research at some of Abu Daher's mining sites, says that of Abu Daher's 40 employees, all receive a formal salary ranging from $800 to $4,000 per month in U.S. dollars or in tether. The blacksmith, who makes the least of any of Abu Daher's staff, earns more than 26 times the minimum wage in Lebanon, according to Shafer.Abu Daher mines for a mix of cryptocurrencies, including litecoin, dogecoin, bitcoin, and ethereum classic — and in some cases, he has programmed the machines to switch to mine whichever is the most profitable coin that day. He uses software called TeamViewer to remotely monitor and keep track of all this hardware.""Each machine can mine many coins, and each coin has their specific equations,"" explained Abu Daher. ""Maybe today the best coin to mine is bitcoin, tomorrow it's litecoin, and the day after that, it's ethereum. We are always moving to have the most profit that we can.""Around two-thirds of his customers are Lebanese, including some mining for bitcoin, dogecoin, or litecoin as a way to get spending money for daily expenses like fuel and food. One-quarter are Syrian, and the remaining 8% are a mix of people living in Egypt, Turkey, France, and the United Kingdom.With some of his clients, Abu Daher is merely a custodian of the machines — housing them, cooling them, and providing steady electrical power and strong internet access. He charges a fee and in exchange, he gives them a cut of the mining proceeds in crypto. Others just ask him to broker the equipment sale and install it. Unlike the massive mining farms of Texas that stack hundreds of thousands of machines into buildings the size of multiple football stadiums, Abu Daher prefers to spread out his electrical footprint, divvying up his thousands of miners in places like stores, basements, and apartments, each with 10 to 20 machines, unless it's a house where he can split up groupings of miners into different rooms. In exchange for the space, Abu Daher pays rent in cash. In what was once a barbershop, for instance, Abu Daher runs 15 ASICs.""At first glance, the town does not look like much of what you would think a 'mining' town would look like, but then you look inside the storefronts that are replacing traditional businesses, and you get a better feeling. For example, one of Ahmad's farms used to be a barbershop – there's still a mirror inside and ads for beauty products – but make no mistake that it is a fully fledged mining farm,"" said El Chamaa of some of the mines in the Chouf range.He added that, ""The mining farms themselves were not as impressive as the ones I've seen on TikTok, but my keen observation was that they get the job done either way.""Now, Abu Daher is trying to educate the locals about mining, mainly because he needs the extra manpower to keep the business going.""We are trying to let someone in each village learn about mining in the purpose to help us. We can't cover all the machines we have by my team, because we have a huge amount of machines, and we are selling a huge amount of machines,"" he said. In Oct. 2019, money stopped making sense in Lebanon. After a season of unrest triggered by an ill-fated taxation scheme and years of economic mismanagement, banks first limited withdrawals and then shut their doors entirely as much of the world descended into Covid lockdowns.Hyperinflation took root. The local currency, which had a peg of 1,500 Lebanese pounds to $1 for 25 years, began to rapidly depreciate. The street rate is now around 40,000 pounds to $1. After re-opening, the banks refused to keep up with this extreme depreciation, and offered much lower exchange rates for U.S. dollars than they were worth on the open market. Today, withdrawals of U.S. dollars deposited into the Lebanese banking system before 2019 are capped, and each so-called ""lollar"" is paid out at a rate worth about 15% of its actual value, according to estimates from multiple locals and experts living across Lebanon.Meanwhile, banks still offer the full market-rate exchange rate for U.S. dollars deposited after 2019. These are now known colloquially as ""fresh dollars.""Cryptocurrencies are volatile — the price of bitcoin has dropped about 70% from its peak a year ago — but the power of earning fresh dollars is a massive incentive for Lebanese to enter mining. Rawad El Hajj, a 27-year-old with a marketing degree, found out about Abu Daher's mining operation three years ago through his brother.""We started because there is not enough work in Lebanon,"" El Hajj said.El Hajj, who lives south of the capital in a city called Barja, started small, purchasing two miners to start.""Then every month, we started to go bigger and bigger,"" he said.Because of the distance to Abu Daher's farms, El Hajj pays to outsource the work of hosting and maintaining the rigs. He tells CNBC that his 11 machines mine for litecoin and dogecoin, which collectively bring in the equivalent of about .02 bitcoin a month, or $360.It's a similar story for Salah Al Zaatare, an architect living 20 minutes south of El Hajj in the coastal city of Sidon. Al Zaatare tells CNBC that he began mining dogecoin and litecoin in March of this year to augment his income. He now has 10 machines that he keeps with Abu Daher. Al Zaatare's machines are newer models so he pulls in more than El Hajj — about $7,200 a month.""I got into it because I think it will become a good investment for the future,"" Al Zaatare told CNBC.Al Zaatare pulled all of his money out of the bank before the crisis hit in 2019, and he held onto that cash until deciding to invest his life savings into mining equipment last year.""I don't have any problem now living in Lebanon since I am getting fresh dollars from mining,"" said Myriam Harfoush, a 32-year-old French teacher living in Baakleen — about a 45-minute drive south of Beirut.Harfoush, who trades in crypto on the side, told CNBC in a WhatsApp message that she took all of her money out of the bank at the start of the crisis and now has mining machines in Zaarouriyeh. (Harfoush only spoke to CNBC in written messages on WhatsApp, citing concerns over speaking by phone.)""If you can get the machine, and you get the power, you get the money,"" said Shafer. ""Crypto is something that with the right type of expertise, you can produce in your local context."" Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, dogecoin, and litecoin are created through a process known as proof-of-work, in which miners around the world run high-powered computers that collectively validate transactions and simultaneously create new tokens. The process requires a lot of electricity, and because this is the only variable cost in a low-margin industry, miners tend to seek out the cheapest sources of power. More often than not, renewables offer the most competitive pricing on electricity.""It's a way to convert a locally stranded resource (electricity) into a global commodity,"" explained Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, which focuses on blockchain investments. ""Hydro, especially run on the river, is one of those classic resources which tends to have a supply-demand mismatch.""Dammed hydro can better accommodate fluctuations in demand and grid needs, whereas run-of-the-river hydro produces constantly, Carter tells CNBC. ""So you often see these stranded or underutilized hydro resources being monetized part of the time with bitcoin mining, as we saw infamously in Sichuan and Yunnan in China,"" continued Carter.Abu Daher taps into a hydropower project which harnesses electricity from the 90-mile Litani River that cuts across southern Lebanon. He says he is getting 20 hours a day of electricity at old pre-inflationary rates.""So basically, we are paying very cheap electricity, and we are getting fresh dollars through mining,"" continued Abu Daher.But the government, facing electrical shortages, is starting to crack down.In January, police raided a small crypto mining farm in the hydro-powered town of Jezzine, seizing and dismantling mining rigs in the process. Soon after, the Litani River Authority, which oversees the country's hydroelectric sites, reportedly said that ""energy intensive cryptomining"" was ""straining its resources and draining electricity.""But Abu Daher tells CNBC he is neither worried about being raided — nor the government's proposal to hike up the price of electricity.""We had some meetings with the police, and we don't have any problems with them, because we are taking legal electricity, and we are not affecting the infrastructure,"" he said.Whereas Abu Daher says that he has set up a meter that officially tracks how much energy his machines have consumed, other miners have allegedly hitched their rigs to the grid illegally and are not paying for power. ""Basically, a lot of other persons are having some issues, because they are not paying for electricity, and they are affecting the infrastructure,"" he said.Abu Daher, who has a knack for building creative designs to solve real-world problems, says that his next goal is creating a closed energy loop for his mining farms. He envisions a system in which the heat produced by the machines is harnessed and that geothermal energy is repurposed to power the miners, as well as to heat homes and hospitals in the villages where these mines are located.""Instead of buying fuel to heat up our homes, we would buy mining machines. We produce heat to heat up our building, and at the same time, we produce money,"" Abu Daher explained of his grand vision for the future of crypto mining in Lebanon."
2022-11-09,"Despite FTX being the fourth-biggest crypto exchange, the company wasn't immune from the downturn in digital assets.""It shows that no one is too big to fail,"" said Pascal Gauthier, CEO of crypto wallet firm Ledger. ""FTX seemed untouchable.""Economists say crypto is not yet of a ""systemic"" scale where governments would feel the need to intervene if a company fails. Binance's agreement to salvage rival cryptocurrency exchange FTX from collapse shows how no one is safe from the chill of crypto winter, according to industry experts.Before this week, FTX was the fourth-biggest exchange, processing billions of dollars in daily trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, had a high profile in Washington, D.C., appearing in Congress to testify about the future of the crypto industry and committing millions in political donations.Despite this, not even FTX was exempt from the downturn in digital assets. It's something even Bankman-Fried had recognized, telling CNBC previously, ""I don't think we're immune from it.""And, sure enough, on Tuesday his firm signed an offer from Binance to be acquired by the company for an undisclosed amount after facing what it called a ""liquidity crunch.""""It shows that no one is too big to fail,"" said Pascal Gauthier, CEO of crypto wallet firm Ledger. ""FTX seemed untouchable.""The expression ""too big to fail"" was used during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and referred to regulators' determination then that certain institutions could not be allowed to go bankrupt, because of the danger such an outcome would pose to the wider financial system.Multiple financial institutions received taxpayer aid in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. A lot can change in a day — especially in crypto.On Monday, Bankman-Fried, took to Twitter in since-deleted tweets to play down concerns his crypto trading empire was at risk of collapsing.FTX is ""fine,"" Bankman-Fried had said, and the exchange had enough assets to cover clients' holdings should they look to take their funds off the platform.His comments came after a report from CoinDesk said that Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's quant trading firm, had $14.6 billion of assets against $8 billion of liabilities. Most of its assets were reportedly in FTT, FTX's native token. FTT subsequently plunged in value.A day later, the 32-year-old entrepreneur, who had styled himself as a ""lender of last resort"" figure in the struggling crypto sector, announced he would sell the exchange he co-founded three years ago to Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange.The debacle highlights something economists have long cautioned about when it comes to crypto: While the industry may be worth billions of dollars — it was once valued at $3 trillion by CoinGecko — in reality, its size is not yet of a ""systemic"" scale where regulators would feel the need to intervene if a company fails.And, unlike the banking industry which is heavily regulated, crypto is not yet subject to regulations in the U.S. or other major countries, although that's expected to change soon as jurisdictions like the European Union bring in new rules. Whereas in the 2008 financial crisis, countries felt compelled to intervene to prevent the collapse of the banking system, with crypto that duty has been left to private sector companies.""Most of the activity in crypto continues to remain trading and speculation, hence, broadly the impact from any downside in crypto is also quite limited in a way, compared to banking and financial services in 2008 where the impact was much more entrenched and wide spread,"" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and strategy at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC via email.Asked whether this was crypto's ""Lehman moment,"" Ledger's Gauthier said this had played out previously with the collapse of players like Three Arrows Capital and Celsius: ""I think what we're witnessing right now is somewhat the ripple effects of what happened in [the first half] in our industry.""The debacle highlights how the crypto industry is becoming more centralized and straying from its decentralized roots, according to Gauthier. Bitcoin and other digital coins are ""designed to be decentralized and not rely on a middleman,"" he said.""FTX is a very big warning for everyone,"" Gauthier said in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday. ""You can't just wait for the next value proposition to fail."" FTX wasn't the first company to come under financial stress, and it's expected that it won't be the last.Earlier this year, Celsius, a crypto lending company, filed for bankruptcy after a plunge in the value of the tokens terra and luna rendered it unable to process customer withdrawals.Crypto fund manager Three Arrows Capital and broker Voyager Digital also subsequently fell into bankruptcy, highlighting the interconnectedness of various players that owed one another money.Some traders are worried Solana, a blockchain platform competing with Ethereum, might be the next crypto player to be tested by the market sell-off. Solana's sol token sank more than 30% on Wednesday over fears about its connection with Alameda Research. Alameda owns more than $1 billion worth of sol, according to CoinDesk.""Is this the end of [the crypto contagion] or will there be any further dominoes to fall? It's anyone's best guess,"" said Gauthier. ""People should not wait to find out.""On whether Binance might itself be vulnerable to collapse one day, Gauthier said he thinks people should be ""reasonably worried"" but added the firm has a ""relatively solid value proposition.""Ayyar said the FTX situation will likely add greater impetus for the largely unregulated crypto to be regulated.""Crypto has been growing in terms of usage and utility and regulators will continue to be forced to take a more active stance on ensuring that platforms play by some rules and structure,"" he told CNBC.Correction: Vijay Ayyar is vice president of corporate development and strategy at Luno. An earlier version misstated his title."

Bankman-Fried tried to reassure investors just on Monday that the company's assets were fine. But after Binance's Zhao said publicly that his company was selling its holdings in FTX's native token FTT, the sell-off was on, and FTX could do nothing to stop it.One of Silicon Valley's most prominent VC firms, Sequoia Capital, sank $210 million into the company, according to independent reporter Eric Newcomer.

2022-11-11,"FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms, is in major financial turmoil.At its peak, FTX was valued at $32 billion. The company filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11 after competing offshore crypto exchange, Binance, backed out of a deal to acquire it and users withdrew around $6 billion in funds.FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, who often goes by SBF, stepped down as CEO on Friday. He saw his estimated net worth drop by billions virtually overnight as his cryptocurrency exchange platform teeters on the brink of collapse.Between Nov. 8-9, Bankman-Fried's net worth plummeted to $991.5 million. That's around a 94% drop from his estimated $15.2 billion previously, according to a Bloomberg analysis.""The fall of FTX could be the moment that really kicks off the broader decline — maybe even demise — of cryptocurrency,"" James Royal, principal reporter at Bankrate, tells CNBC Make It. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, initially invested in FTX in 2019, but later sold his controlling stake in 2021, Reuters reports.Zhao was paid about $2.1 billion worth of FTT, the native crypto token that gives users access to the FTX trading platform.Here's why that matters: A leaked balance sheet revealed that the value of Bankman-Fried's crypto trading firm, Alameda Research, was heavily reliant on the value of FTT, according to Coindesk.So when Zhao announced on Nov. 6 that his company would liquidate any remaining FTT it held due to ""recent revelations,"" it triggered fears among investors that FTX would be unable to pay its debts.Many began to withdraw their funds, which led to a stark 72% drop in FTT's price. As FTT's price fell, so did the value of FTX's assets that were tied to it. ""The first thing traders need to do now is understand the legal duty that an exchange has to them, and whether their assets are held securely,"" Royal says.Like many other crypto exchanges, FTX's insurance coverage only addresses certain criminal events such as theft or fraud, Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist at MarketVector Indexes, tells CNBC Make it.""There is no insurance coverage just because the exchange fails,"" he says. ""If there's no bailout, depositors in FTX could lose everything."" In short, it doesn't look good. ""The events shook the broader cryptocurrency markets, sending bitcoin and other currencies to two-year lows,"" Leinweber says.Bitcoin's price hovered around $17,000 as of Nov. 11, down from above $20,000 on Nov. 8 and well below the peak price of around $68,000 it reached in November 2021.""With the exception of so-called stablecoins, crypto prices are supported entirely by belief in their future, not by any fundamental underpinning such as assets or cash flow,"" Royal says.That means crypto's value solely depends on what someone is willing to pay for it, which is why its price can be subject to erratic fluctuations and dips.""Crypto has been seen as a lottery ticket, and hypesters have been pumping crypto for years,"" Royal says. ""Unfortunately, it usually takes massive losses for the scales to fall from traders' eyes.""Don't miss: California isn’t the No. 1 state for cryptocurrency enthusiasts—but it still ranks in the top 7"

Bankman-Fried says he was unaware of the extent of user leverage because of poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts.Scaramucci was hesitant to attribute the exchange's failure to malice.""I don't want to call it fraud at this moment because that's actually a legal term,"" Scaramucci said. ""I would implore Sam and his family to tell the truth to their investors, get to the bottom of it.""Bankman-Fried tweeted Thursday morning that he is ""sorry,"" admitting that he ""f---ed up"" and ""should have done better.""Bankman-Fried said his first mistake was poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts, which meant that he was ""substantially off"" on his sense of users' margin. ""I thought it was way lower.""Scaramucci speculated that Bankman-Fried could have made mistakes in the throes of the crypto bear market, specifically when Three Arrows, a massive cryptocurrency hedge fund, liquidated in June 2022.""When Three Arrows went down, it could be possible, Andrew, that Sam had difficulty then, and then he made some decisions that turned out to be disastrous for him and both sides of this business,"" he said Friday, speaking to CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.Scaramucci told ""Squawk Box"" that he went to the Bahamas to help Bankman-Fried as an investor and friend. When he got there, he says, it appeared beyond the point of a simple liquidity rescue.Binance seems to have made the same assessment. The world's largest cryptocurrency firm broke a nonbinding deal to rescue FTX after conducting due diligence and the news ""regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations.""Scaramucci said he didn't see evidence of this mishandling when he and other investors first screened FTX as a potential business partner.""Duped I guess is the right word, but I am very disappointed because I do like Sam,"" Scaramucci said.

That followed an article on CoinDesk, pointing out that Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's hedge fund, held an outsized amount of FTT on its balance sheet.Not only did Zhao's public pronouncement cause a plunge in the price of FTT, it led FTX customers to hit the exits. Bankman-Fried said in a tweet that FTX clients on Sunday demanded roughly $5 billion of withdrawals, which he called ""the largest by a huge margin."" That was the day of SBF's emergency meeting in the Bahamian capital.The heads of FTX's regulatory and legal teams were reportedly in the room, as Bankman-Fried revealed multiple spreadsheets detailing how much cash FTX had loaned to Alameda and for what purpose, according to Reuters.Those documents, which apparently reflected the most recent financial state of the company, showed a $10 billion transfer of customer deposits from FTX to Alameda. They also revealed that some of these funds — somewhere in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion — could not be accounted for among Alameda's assets.The financial discovery process also unearthed a ""back door"" in FTX's books that was created with ""bespoke software.""The two sources speaking to Reuters described it as a way that ex-CEO Bankman-Fried could make changes to the company's financial record without flagging the transaction either internally or externally. That mechanism theoretically could have, for example, prevented the $10 billion transfer to Alameda from being flagged to either his internal compliance team or to external auditors.Reuters says that Bankman-Fried issued an outright denial of implementing a so-called back door.Both FTX and Alameda Research did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."

Marszalek tweeted Sunday that the firm had meant to send the funds to its ""cold wallet"" — meaning an offline cryptocurrency wallet — but were instead moved to a whitelisted corporate account with Gate.io. In its own statement, Gate.io said the transactions were the result of an ""operation error transfer"" and that all assets have since been returned to Crypto.com.

""As long as our users are holding it, we will be holding it. We have no control over what you guys buy.""He added that Crypto.com has never used its CRO token as collateral for any loans in its history. A source told CNBC previously that Bankman-Fried's Alameda was borrowing from FTX and using the exchange's FTT token to back those loans.Marszalek admitted that Crypto.com had transferred $1 billion to FTX over a year but that this was aimed at ""hedging"" customers' orders. Crypto.com ""only had exposure of under $10 million when FTX shut down,"" he added.""The way the brokerage part of our business works is that, every time a customer places an order to buy or sell, we have multiple venues where we could hedge this order and we pick the most cost efficient one with [the] best liquidity, lowest cost so we can pass on these savings to our customers,"" Crypto.com's CEO said.""This means that we are not taking any market risk, we are always market neutral.

On Monday, Zhao said he did not mean to trigger ""turmoil"" in crypto markets, adding that while some people have blamed him for ""whistleblowing or poking the bubble"" he wasn't aware his tweet would cause such damage.Speaking about the possibility of more players facing a crisis after FTX's collapse, Zhao said ""there will be some cascading contagion effects."" The scale of failures of crypto companies — and resulting drops in the prices of digital currencies — will lessen over time, he added.""In this type of situation, the first one to go down is the usually the big one,"" said Zhao. ""The cascading effects become smaller and smaller.""Crypto's crisis this year largely stemmed from an intermingling of businesses owing money to others and having their reserves tied up in illiquid tokens.In May, the $60 billion stablecoin project Terra saw its two main tokens become worthless after the sustainability of their technical model was questioned. That in turn prompted a wave of failures in crypto, with Celsius, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital all filing for bankruptcy protection.""A couple of years later all of this will blow away,"" Zhao said, commenting on FTX's collapse and the ensuing crypto selloff. ""People may not even remember this.""Earlier Monday morning, Zhao said Binance would set up an ""industry recovery fund"" to help distressed firms and ""reduce further cascading negative effects."" Details of the fund are scant, however the Binance boss said more would be revealed soon.Binance has its own venture fund which makes investments in crypto projects, called Binance Labs. So far, Zhao hasn't heard any ""big cries for help"" from his portfolio companies which, he said, are ""much less impacted"" than other firms in the industry. Zhao's remarks echoed comments from Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek earlier Monday who, in response to concerns of an FTX-style liquidity crisis, said his firm had a ""tremendously strong balance sheet"" and wasn't having any trouble handling a jump in withdrawals.""We never engage as a company in any irresponsible lending practices, we never took any third-party risks,"" he said.Alameda Research, FTX's sister company, borrowed billions in customer funds from the exchange to ensure it had enough funds on hand to process withdrawals, CNBC reported Sunday.Bankman-Fried declined to comment on allegations of misappropriating customer funds but said its recent bankruptcy filing was the result of issues with a leveraged trading position."

In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are opening their own probes into FTX's bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried's ""misconduct."" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also called for ""more effective oversight of cryptocurrency markets"" in remarks released Wednesday. She said the impact from the FTX bankruptcy on the broader financial system has been limited. However, a recent report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which Treasury chairs, warned that any more intermingling between the traditional financial system and crypto markets ""could raise broader financial stability concerns.""Cryptocurrency lender BlockFi Inc. is reportedly weighing bankruptcy, telling investors it has ""significant exposure"" to the FTX failure.

2022-11-16,"At Abu Dhabi Finance Week, Roubini said ""the lesson of the last few weeks is these people should be out of here,"" referring to major turbulence in the industry.He also took aim at Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, whose company he said regulators should ""be thinking carefully"" about.Earlier at the same event, CZ the the crypto industry ""will be fine,"" and there was ""significant interest"" in his proposal for a crypto recovery fund. Outspoken economist Nouriel Roubini described crypto and some of its major players as an ""ecosystem that is totally corrupt.""On a panel hosted by CNBC's Dan Murphy at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week on Wednesday, the New York University professor said there were ""seven Cs of crypto"": ""Concealed, corrupt, crooks, criminals, con men, carnival barkers,"" and finally, Binance Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, who spoke on a prior panel at the same conference.""The lesson of the last few weeks is these people should be out of here,"" Roubini added. Binance declined to comment when contacted by CNBC.Recent turbulence in the crypto market has seen the collapse of one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges, FTX, with the revelation of highly risky and unsustainable borrowing and lending by the company and related investment funds.The price of bitcoin has plunged below $17,000 for the first time since 2020, and some fear the contagion could spread to topple other major players, such as Crypto.com. The CEO of the company has denied this.Binance has repeatedly centered the story around FTX, with the company initially suggesting it would buy its failing rival before pulling out of the plan.""I can't believe that CZ and Binance have a license to operate in the UAE. He's banned in the U.K., he's under investigation by U.S. Justice Department for money laundering,"" said Roubini, who was nicknamed ""Dr. Doom"" for his prior pessimistic forecasts, including a prediction of the property market crash in 2007-2008.Roubini continued to criticize the Binance CEO, expressing his bewilderment that ""he was here on this stage and has residence in this country,"" referring to the United Arab Emirates. ""The regulators should be thinking carefully,"" he said. ""That's a walking time bomb.""On the same day, Binance received a Financial Services Permission from Abu Dhabi's financial services regulatory authority, the Abu Dhabi Global Market. Dubai, the UAE's commercial capital, granted the crypto exchange its green light earlier in the year, upgrading it from a provisional license to a Minimal Viable Product license in September, which allowed it to offer a variety of virtual asset services to investors.FTX had also planned to launch operations in Dubai, receiving a partial license from the Gulf emirate in March, when it announced it would set up a regional headquarters there. The UAE has been implementing a number of reforms and frameworks to become a crypto hub, even as other countries and governments sound the alarm over the industry's risks. In September, Reuters reported that U.S. federal prosecutors had in 2020 asked Binance for internal records about its anti-money laundering checks, along with communications involving CZ.Countries have taken varying attitudes toward oversight of crypto firms as the industry has ballooned in size in recent years.After stating in a July 2021 blog that he wanted to increase engagement with regulatory authorities, CZ has led Binance to approval in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and in May won regulatory approval in France, its first major European jurisdiction. On Wednesday, it announced it had gained further approval in Abu Dhabi to provide custody services to professional clients.However, it is banned in the U.K. and was made to limit its activities in Singapore. Binance U.S., meanwhile, was set up and is run by a separate team in order to comply with domestic regulation.Other countries, such as India, have sought to prohibit crypto trading altogether. Before Roubini's comments in Abu Dhabi, CZ said on a separate panel the crypto industry needed an association establishing best practices and to speak with regulators around the world.He also said he had seen ""very significant interest"" in assistance for his proposal to set up a recovery fund to support crypto projects facing a liquidity crunch.Discussing his biggest mistake, he said: ""Originally I would've said we could've moved a bit faster but given what happened last week that might not have been a great idea. Doing things step by step is actually more important.""In response to a question on whether crypto needed saving, he said: ""Crypto has actually shown extreme resilience ...

2022-11-18,"Although the implosion of one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges has left many investors shaken, billionaire Mark Cuban still believes in crypto.Cuban has remained invested in crypto because he believes in smart contracts, one of the key underlying technologies that allow crypto transactions to be made, he explained on Twitter on Nov. 13.Essentially, a smart contract is a computer program that is embedded into a blockchain network. They operate according to ""if/then"" commands; if X, then execute Y.For a simple example of how a smart contract works, think of a vending machine. Typically, you make your selection, insert the required amount of money and receive the item. The ""smart contract"" within the machine is coded to dispense the selected item after the payment is made.Cuban believes smart contracts will have a significant impact in creating valuable applications that have utility for everyone.In Cuban's view, a token's value is derived from which applications it can be used for and how useful those applications are for users, he says on Twitter.But what's still needed is an application that is useful to people both within and outside of the crypto world, one that's helpful enough that people would be willing to learn how to use cryptocurrency in order to use the application. Despite Cuban's bullish outlook on crypto, he has a sharp critique of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.""With FTX now — that's somebody running a company that's just dumb as f--- greedy,"" Cuban said while speaking at a Sports Business Journal conference on Nov. 11.FTX's collapse is expected to have a ripple effect throughout the crypto industry. Multicoin Capital, one of the top crypto venture firms that has assets tied to FTX, told investors it expects many trading firms will be wiped out and shut down in coming weeks amid the fallout.However, Cuban doesn't see the recent events shaking up the crypto market as ""crypto blowups,"" but rather ""banking blowups,"" he recently tweeted. That includes lending funds to the wrong entity.Cuban is a longtime cryptocurrency investor. Over the years, he's invested in Ethereum and other various digital coins, NFTs and many blockchain companies.In fact, ""80% of the investments that I make that are not on 'Shark Tank' are in or around cryptocurrencies,"" he said during an episode of ""The Problem With Jon Stewart"" podcast on Jan. 12.However, some finance experts advise against investing too much in crypto. ""Cryptocurrencies are a confidence game par excellence,"" James Royal, principal reporter at Bankrate, tells CNBC Make It.""With the exception of so-called stablecoins, crypto prices are supported entirely by belief in their future, not by any fundamental underpinning, such as assets or cash flow,"" Royal says.It's important to note that cryptocurrency is a highly volatile asset that's subject to erratic fluctuations in value. Since there's no guarantee you'll earn a profit on your investment, financial experts typically advise that you don't invest more than you're willing to potentially lose.Don't miss: FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried lost billions and the company filed for bankruptcy—it could signal the ‘demise’ of crypto, expert says Disclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to ""Shark Tank."""
2022-11-18,"Bahamian regulators acknowledged transferring FTX assets into their custody after an emergency filing from FTX's U.S. attorneys accused them of having directed former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to do so.It's the latest turmoil in an explosive bankruptcy that has rocked the cryptocurrency space and left investors reeling across multiple exchanges.Regulators said they did not believe that FTX's Bahama subsidiary was subject to the U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings. Securities regulators in the Bahamas conceded that they ordered the transfer of FTX digital assets from company wallets into their own custody, citing the authority granted to them by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas and challenging FTX's assertion that the U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy processes applied to them.In a press statement Thursday evening, the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB) said it had exercised ""its powers as a regulator"" and directed the transfer of ""all digital assets"" of FTX Digital Markets, a Bahamian subsidiary of the FTX empire.The value of the assets is unknown. Crypto research firm Elliptic, however, believes that the $477 million theft reported over this weekend was tied to moves by Bahamian regulators.Statements from both the Bahamas and U.S. attorneys suggest ""that the 'hack' was actually the seizure of FTX assets by the Bahamian government,"" Elliptic wrote.The filing struck back at an emergency filing by FTX in U.S. court which challenged the standing of the Bahamian liquidators and asked the Delaware Bankruptcy Court to intervene and enforce an automatic stay, a standard feature of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. That filing accused the Bahamian government of seizing FTX assets and moving them into their own custody, an accusation borne out by the SCB's own statement.Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of FTX and the ex-majority owner of a complex web of FTX-Alameda Research subsidiaries, was accused by FTX's lawyers of working with Bahamian regulators to move digital assets out of FTX's custody and into a Fireblocks asset custody account.Bankman-Fried was effectively in the custody of the Bahamian government, the FTX filing observed.""It is not the understanding of the Commission that FDM [FTX Digital Markets] is a party to the US Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings,"" the Bahamian regulator's release read.Bankman-Fried, securities regulators and FTX's lawyers have not yet responded to requests for comment.— CNBC's Mackenzie Sigalos contributed to this report."
2022-11-18,"Ripple is expanding its presence in the EU, where it plans to ""passport"" its services through an entity in Ireland, General Counsel Stuart Alderoty told CNBC.Most of Ripple's business is now driven outside of the U.S. despite its large presence in the country, Alderoty said.The SEC is suing Ripple for selling the XRP cryptocurrency without first registering it as a security; Ripple says XRP shouldn't be treated as a security.Alderoty said FTX's collapse into bankruptcy last week was ""a call to action for responsible economic centers to work to get it right."" U.S.-based crypto company Ripple no longer derives most of its income from America and is looking to expand its reach in Europe, its top lawyer said.Speaking in an interview with CNBC earlier this week, Ripple General Counsel Stuart Alderoty said that ""effectively, Ripple is operating outside of the U.S."" today due to the fallout from its extensive legal fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission.""Essentially, its customers and its revenue are all driven outside of the U.S., even though we still have a lot of employees inside of the U.S.,"" he added.At the same time, Ripple is expanding its presence in Europe.The startup has two employees on the ground in the Republic of Ireland currently. It is seeking a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license from the Irish central bank so that it can ""passport"" its services throughout the Eurpean Union via an entity based there, Alderoty told CNBC.Ripple also plans to file an application for an electronic money license in Ireland ""shortly."" Its commitment to invest in Europe comes despite a deep downturn in crypto markets that's been referred to as ""crypto winter."" The Irish central bank previously handed a VASP license to crypto exchange Gemini.Ripple, which helps financial institutions move money around the world using blockchain technology, has over 750 employees globally, with roughly half of them based in the U.S. About 60 are based in its London office, which Alderoty was visiting this week during a trip to the U.K. for its annual Swell event. In 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission initiated a lawsuit against Ripple alleging the company and its executives illegally sold XRP, a cryptocurrency its founders created in 2012, to investors without first registering it as a security.Ripple disputes the claim, saying the token should not be considered an investment contract and is used in its business to facilitate cross-border transactions between banks and other financial institutions.Alderoty said he expects a ruling on the case to arrive in the first half of 2023. Final legal briefs are due by Nov. 30, after which a judge can either make a ruling or refer it to a jury trial if they find there are any issues of disputed fact.""We are at the beginning of the end of the process in our case,"" Alderoty said.As part of the proceedings, Ripple fought to obtain documents related to a June 2018 speech from former SEC official Bill Hinman, which it says has aided its case. In the speech, Hinman says that sales of ether, a rival token, ""are not securities transactions.""Despite its tense dispute with the SEC, Ripple is still ""work very closely with policymakers in the U.S.,"" Alderoty said.XRP was once the third-largest cryptocurrency, commanding a $120 billion market value in early 2018. It has dropped sharply since, however, amid U.S. regulatory scrutiny and a wider downturn in bitcoin and other digital currencies.Last week, the shock collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX sent cryptocurrencies into a tailspin. Bankman-Fried's investment firm allegedly used FTX client funds to make risky trades, CNBC reported previously. The company spiraled into a liquidity crisis as customers demanded withdrawals and rival exchange Binance scrapped its nonbinding agreement to buy the company.Bankman-Fried has said he got ""overconfident"" and ""careless"" as he grew FTX into a $32 billion juggernaut. He said that, to the best of his knowledge, he thought FTX had built up around $5 billion of leverage, when in actuality it was around $13 billion.Alderoty said FTX's bankruptcy was ""a call to action for responsible economic centers to work to get it right."" On Wednesday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC that the idea that crypto is not regulated is ""overstated."" But, he added, ""transparency builds trust.""""Crypto has never just been sunshine and roses and as an industry, it needs to mature,"" Garlinghouse said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" Ripple is unlikely to refer to the FTX collapse and how it was handled by regulators in its case, Alderoty added.Some of the confusion surrounding XRP stems from the company's part ownership of the token. Ripple previously held as much as 60% of the XRP tokens in circulation. It has since reduced that amount to below half, or 49%, according to Alderoty.Ripple generates a chunk of its sales by releasing its supply of XRP on the open market. For the last three years, it only has only sold XRP to enterprise customers rather than retail traders, Alderoty said.As a private company, Ripple doesn't disclose its revenues publicly. This year, the firm processed $10 billion in cross-border transactions with payment providers and other financial institutions using XRP, a token it is closely associated with.Ripple, the company, was last valued by investors at $15 billion. XRP has a market capitalization of $19 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ripple's European expansion drive comes in anticipation of the EU's MiCA crypto regulations going into effect in the coming years. MiCA seeks to align rules on crypto assets across the 27-member bloc. It was passed by EU lawmakers earlier this year.The EU has said it may still need to come up with a separate regime for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, a specific type of digital asset that tracks ownership of art and other assets on the blockchain.""I think MiCA's a very good start,"" Alderoty said.The U.K. is also a priority. Ripple on Monday released a set of guidelines outlining how it thinks Britain should regulate crypto.A bill is making its way through the U.K. Parliament that would give the financial regulator greater oversight of crypto, however this is yet to become law.Crypto executives are hoping Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is a fan of crypto and so-called ""Web3,"" will issue regulatory clarity to make the country a more attractive place for businesses to set up shop."

FTX admitted that ""unauthorized transactions"" had occurred, but did not give details on how much money was moved.Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said on Sunday that the stolen funds ""are on the move.""The hacker has begun dumping some of their ether holding into other assets, according to public blockchain records of the account suspected to be linked to the person.

2022-11-21,"Hackers who stole around $477 million worth of cryptocurrency from collapsed exchange FTX have started to launder the funds into bitcoin.The stolen money has been converted into different digital coins but the bulk of it — more than $280 million — was changed into the cryptocurrency ether.Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, told CNBC that the hackers were converting the ether into a crypto product called RenBTC which is then being converted into bitcoin via a bridge. Hackers who stole around $477 million worth of cryptocurrency from collapsed exchange FTX have started to launder the funds into bitcoin.This month, after FTX filed for bankruptcy, new CEO John Ray III said that ""unauthorized access to certain assets has occurred.""Blockchain analytics company Elliptic estimates that around $477 million worth of cryptocurrency had been stolen from FTX.The theft adds insult to injury to FTX, a once $32 billion crypto empire who collapse has sent shockwaves across the industry.The stolen money has been converted into different digital coins but the bulk of it — more than $280 million — was changed into the cryptocurrency ether, according to public blockchain records of the account linked to the hackers. Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, told CNBC that the hackers were converting the ether into a crypto product called RenBTC which is then being converted into bitcoin via a bridge. This allows one crypto to be converted into another without going through a centralized exchange.""This is a common tactic in the laundering of crypto thefts,"" Robinson said.Elliptic researchers have documented how RenBridge has been used to launder ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars in cryptocurrency suspected of being sourced from ransomware attacks or hacks. Some of those hacks have connections to Russian-backed ransomware groups, according to Elliptic.So far, $74 million has been moved to bitcoin from RenBTC using RenBridge.Alameda, a trading firm and sister company to FTX, acquired RenBridge in 2021 as part of FTX's broader efforts to build out Solana and Serum.Serum is a ""decentralized exchange,"" with a Serum token running natively on Solana, promising users faster settlement and execution times. FTX and Alameda were large backers of the project, which was forked in an attempt to prevent FTX control following the bankruptcy.On Nov. 11, FTX users noted unusual transfers of cryptocurrency, sparking fears that FTX's platform had been compromised. Posts in FTX's Telegram thread indicated that the app and platform had in fact been infiltrated and compromised.Further allegations that Bankman-Fried worked with the regulators in the Bahamas to move crypto out of FTX wallets came after a Vox interview — which Bankman-Fried would later claim he understood as a casual conversation with a reporter friend — in which the ex-CEO of FTX pinned the suspected theft of FTX crypto on a disgruntled employee. FTX filings said they discovered the Bahamian transfers while investigating the weekend crypto theft. What those filings left unanswered was if those two were one and the same, or two separate occurrences.It is yet unclear how much the assets that Bahamian regulators took into custody are worth. CNBC reported on an emergency court filing by FTX on Nov. 18 to stop further action by the Bahamas regulators. FTX filings alleged that Bankman-Fried was possibly working in concert with those regulators.Hackers are some point will want to cash that money out into fiat. However, Robinson said that will be ""challenging"" due to the ""traceability of crypto.""He said that he expects the hackers to use ""mixers to cover their blockchain trail.""Mixers are services or software that allow a crypto transaction trail to be obfuscated on the blockchain, making it difficult or impossible to trace these funds, Robinson said.""This may be one of the motivations behind moving these assets to bitcoin — the greater availability of mixing services,"" he added.The blockchain is a public ledger of crypto activity. Each coin may have its own blockchain. That makes it possible to trace, to an extent, where funds are moving. The use of mixers could make this difficult.Crypto compliance software company Chainalysis in a tweet on Sunday also confirmed that hackers are moving funds.FTX on Sunday urged cryptocurrency exchanges to keep an eye out for the stolen funds if the hackers try to process the money via one of their services.""Exchanges should take all measures to secure these funds to be returned to the bankruptcy estate,"" FTX said in another tweet.FTX owes its largest creditors some $3.1 billion, according to court filings. Put another way, the hacked money is about 15% of what FTX owes its biggest clients alone.Bankman-Fried once oversaw a sprawling crypto empire that spanned every inhabited continent and claimed billions in assets. The implosion of FTX has left Bankman-Fried a paper pauper and investors left unable to access their crypto assets."

The second-biggest unsecured creditor is claiming over $203 million in unpaid debts from FTX.In total, the unsecured claims — labeled as such as they were not secured by collateral — amount to $3.1 billion. FTX may have more than 1 million creditors, according to an earlier bankruptcy filing.FTX's disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, stepped down as CEO earlier this month as the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.FTX, once valued at $32 billion, collapsed in a matter of days after the CEO of Binance, a rival firm, said his exchange would liquidate its FTT tokens. FTT, the native token of FTX, plunged as a result, leading to a liquidity crunch at FTX.The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice are reportedly investigating what happened.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were trading lower Monday. More than $260 billion has been wiped off the value of the crypto market since Zhao's Nov. 6 tweet.Bankman-Fried has been accused by his peers in the crypto industry of flagrant mismanagement and fraud.His exchange allegedly used customer funds to make risky trades, according to earlier CNBC reporting.In a damning account of FTX's demise last week, its new CEO, John Ray III, said in a filing that many of the FTX group companies ""did not have appropriate corporate governance.""On Thursday, FTX said it has credible evidence that the exchange had moved assets to the custody of the Bahamian government.The company's new chief is now seeking to sell or restructure its global empire.Neither FTX nor Bankman-Fried were available for comment when contacted by CNBC on Monday.Crypto investors have been burned by a number of high-profile failures this year which have led to ripple effects. Earlier this year, the collapse of so-called stablecoin terraUSD had knock-on effects on a number of companies and contributed to the fall of major hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.The latest collapse to rock the market has raised questions over the opacity of big businesses in crypto, an industry often touted as more decentralized and transparent than traditional finance.Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said the FTX debacle has added greater impetus for regulators to act on crypto.""We should not wait until it is large and connected to develop the regulatory frameworks necessary to prevent a crypto shock that could have a much greater destabilizing impact,"" Cunliffe said in a speech Monday at Warwick Business School."

You're an absolute fraud,"" Duffy said he told Bankman-Fried.Now, Duffy is giving further details on what happened leading up to his encounter with him.Duffy wanted to know why the Commodities Futures Trading Commission was looking at Bankman-Fried's request to ease regulatory rules to push his trading model. He was told it was required under innovation guidelines.""Right away my suspicions were up,"" Duffy said. ""Why is there so much pressure coming for this application? And then when I met with him, I knew right away this a joke.""However, Duffy said he isn't surprised FTX captivated so many investors and high-profile donors.""When you have the greatest quarterback of all time and a supermodel wife doing a commercial picking up the phone saying 'Are you in, are you in, are you in.' To me, it looks like a pump-and-dump scheme,"" said Duffy. ""People get very influenced by people like Tom [Brady].""The FTX collapse is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange bankruptcy on record. It's now in the early days of a bankruptcy hearing in Delaware. On Monday, FTX attorney James Bromley, hired by FTX's new management, said ""What we are dealing with is a different sort of animal.""""There are going to be a lot of hearings going on in the future. Let's follow the money. Let's see who knew what, when and where,"" added Duffy.The Senate Agriculture Committee plans to hold a hearing into the FTX implosion on Dec. 1.""I hope someone has the courage to ask, 'Was anybody putting pressure on the CFTC to move forward with an application that could have put everything at risk?'""

2022-11-23,"In a note to DCG shareholders, Silbert addressed all the ""noise"" surrounding the company, indicating that most of its entities are ""operating as usual.""The trading unit Genesis has encountered problems on the lending side due to ""market turmoil,"" Silbert wrote.Silbert said the company as a whole is on pace to generate $800 million in revenue this year.  Barry Silbert, the founder of crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, has joined a growing list of industry leaders in trying to settle investors' nerves after the sudden collapse of FTX.In a note to shareholders on Tuesday, Silbert addressed all the ""noise"" about the financial health of DCG's subsidiaries, which includes trading firm Genesis, Grayscale Investments and mining company Foundry.Since FTX's rapid winddown two weeks ago, investors have worried about a crypto contagion affecting every corner of the industry. Lenders have stopped lending, withdrawals have been more difficult and unregulated, little-understood tokens have plunged in value. The leading cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, have also continued their year-long descent.Silbert, an early bitcoin evangelist who founded DCG in 2015, said that despite the crypto winter, the overall company is on pace to generate $800 million in revenue this year on the back of just $25 million raised in primary capital since inception. Forbes estimates Silbert's net worth at $2 billion.""We have weathered previous crypto winters,"" Silbert wrote, adding that ""while this one may feel more severe, collectively we will come out of it stronger."" Coinbase, Binance and Crypto.com have similarly done their best to assuage customer concerns to avoid an FTX-type run on customer deposits. They've each expressed shock at FTX's apparent deceit of investors and customers and emphasized that client assets are secure.That's all with an awareness that FTX and founder Sam Bankman-Fried betrayed the trust of an industry that was already in the midst of a brutal year of losses. Bankman-Fried said his company's assets were ""fine"" two days before he was desperate for a rescue because of a liquidity crunch.Specific to DCG, investor confidence took a hit in the last week, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Genesis had been trying to raise $1 billion from investors before ultimately halting some withdrawals. There were reports that Genesis would soon file for bankruptcy, which the company publicly refuted.Fear spread to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, known by its ticker GBTC, which lets investors get access to bitcoin through a more traditional security. GBTC is currently trading at a 42% discount to bitcoin, up from a discount of closer to 30% two months ago.Regarding Genesis' lending business, Silbert said in the letter that the suspension of redemptions and new loan originations on Nov. 16 was ""an issue of liquidity and duration mismatch"" in the loan book. These issues, he said, had ""no impact"" on Genesis' spot and derivatives trading or custody businesses, which ""continue to operate as usual.""He acknowledged that Genesis has hired financial and legal advisors, as the firm considers its options.DCG's debts amount to just over $2 billion. The company borrowed roughly $575 million from Genesis. The loans were priced at ""prevailing market interest rates"" and are due in May 2023. It also absorbed the $1.1 billion debt that the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital owed Genesis.With Three Arrows in bankruptcy, DCG ""is pursuing all available remedies to recover assets for the benefit of creditors,"" Silbert wrote. DCG's only other debt is a $350 million credit facility from ""a small group of lenders led by Eldridge.""Read the full letter from Silbert below:Dear Shareholders, There has been a lot of noise over the past week and I want to get in touch directly to clarify where we stand at DCG.Most of you are aware of the situation at Genesis, but to recap up front: Genesis Global Capital, Genesis' lending business, temporarily suspended redemptions and new loan originations last Wednesday, November 16 after market turmoil sparked unprecedented withdrawal requests.  This is an issue of liquidity and duration mismatch in the Genesis loan book.  Importantly, these issues have no impact on Genesis' spot and derivatives trading or custody businesses, which continue to operate as usual.  Genesis leadership and their board decided to hire financial and legal advisors and the firm is exploring all possible options amidst the fallout from the implosion of FTX.In recent days, there has been chatter about intercompany loans between Genesis Global Capital and DCG.  For those unaware, in the ordinary course of business, DCG has borrowed money from Genesis Global Capital in the same vein as hundreds of crypto investment firms.  These loans were always structured on an arm's length basis and priced at prevailing market interest rates.  DCG currently has a liability to Genesis Global Capital of ~$575 million, which is due in May 2023.  These loans were used to fund investment opportunities and to repurchase DCG stock from non-employee shareholders in secondary transactions previously highlighted in quarterly shareholder updates.  And to this day, I've never sold a share of my DCG stock.You may also recall there is a $1.1B promissory note that is due in June 2032.  As we shared in our previous shareholder letter in August 2022, DCG stepped in and assumed certain liabilities from Genesis related to the Three Arrows Capital default.  As stated in August, because these are now DCG liabilities, DCG is participating in the Three Arrows Capital liquidation proceedings on the Creditors' Committee and is pursuing all available remedies to recover assets for the benefit of creditors.  Aside from the Genesis Global Capital intercompany loans due in May 2023 and the long-term promissory note, DCG's only debt is a $350M credit facility from a small group of lenders led by Eldridge.Taking a step back, let me be crystal clear: DCG will continue to be a leading builder of the industry and we are committed to our long-term mission of accelerating the development of a better financial system.  We have weathered previous crypto winters and while this one may feel more severe, collectively we will come out of it stronger.  DCG has only raised $25M in primary capital and we are pacing to do $800M in revenue this year.I bought my first bitcoin a decade ago in 2012 and made the decision that I would commit to this industry for the long term.  In 2013, we founded the first BTC trading firm – Genesis – and the first BTC fund, which evolved into Grayscale, now the world's largest digital currency asset manager.  Foundry runs the largest bitcoin mining pool in the world and is building tomorrow's decentralized infrastructure.  CoinDesk is the industry's premier media, data, and events company and they have done phenomenal work covering this crypto winter.  Luno is one of the most popular crypto wallets in the world and is an industry leader in the emerging markets.  TradeBlock is building a seamless institutional trading platform and as the newest subsidiary, HQ is establishing a life and wealth management platform for digital asset entrepreneurs.  Each of these subsidiaries are standalone businesses that are independently managed and are operating as usual.  Lastly, with a portfolio of 200+ companies and funds, we're often the first check for the industry's best founders. We appreciate the words of encouragement and support, along with offers to invest in DCG.  We will let you know if we decide to do a financing round.Despite the difficult industry conditions, I am as excited as ever about the potential for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology over the coming decades and DCG is determined to remain at the forefront. BarryCorrection: A prior version of this story mistakenly said that DCG loaned money to Genesis.

Southeast Asian tech giants Grab and Gojek said they are ""supportive"" of recommendations made by an advisory committee to expand gig worker protection in Singapore starting in 2024.In Singapore, platform or gig workers, often ride-hailing or food delivery drivers, have thus far been considered self-employed.

2022-11-25,"New York just became the first state to ban certain types of cryptocurrency mining in an effort to address environmental worries over the energy-intensive process.""I will ensure that New York continues to be the center of financial innovation, while also taking important steps to prioritize the protection of our environment,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said in a message after signing the legislation into law on Nov. 22.The new law temporarily freezes the issuance and renewal of air permits to companies that have transformed some of the state's oldest fossil fuel plants into cryptocurrency mining hubs.But the ban doesn't impact individual cryptocurrency miners. The legislation is specifically aimed at cryptocurrency mining companies in the state that consume large amounts of energy by utilizing ""proof-of-work"" authentication — the process that uses sometimes millions of high-powered computers to track and secure transactions in bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Mining crypto can produce harmful emissions by generating electricity through burning coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels.After China began cracking down on bitcoin mining in 2021, upstate New York became a popular hub for digital currency mining due to the availability of cheap energy derived from Niagara Falls and shuttered power plants.However, as companies flocked to the region, climate advocates began ringing the alarm over crypto mining's potential environmental harm. ""Not only does crypto take a toll on the environment, but communities in upstate New York could suffer as once-abandoned coal power plants come back from the dead as 'zombie plants' that mine crypto all day, every day,"" Richard Schrader, the New York Legislative and Policy Director for the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement.The new law also requires New York's Department of Environmental Conservation to examine the crypto mining industry's impact on the environment during the two-year moratorium as the state seeks to reduce its carbon footprint.On a national level, U.S. crypto mining produced about 25 to 50 million metric tons of carbon pollution according to a White House report. That's roughly the equivalent of driving 20 to 40 million gasoline-powered cars for one year according to the Environmental Protection Agency.The crypto industry has attempted to address concerns about its energy consumption and carbon emissions.In September, Ethereum, the largest blockchain behind bitcoin switched to a more energy efficient method of validating crypto transactions that take place on the platform, known as proof-of-stake (PoS).This upgrade is expected to lower Ethereum's carbon footprint by over 99% according to its website.Want to earn more and work less? Register for the free CNBC Make It: Your Money virtual event on Dec. 13 at 12 p.m. ET to learn from money masters how you can increase your earning power.Don't miss: Mark Cuban still believes in crypto despite FTX collapse—here’s why"
2022-11-25,"Cryptocurrencies are suffering from a spectacular fall from grace and are now drawing increasing regulatory scrutiny and investigations around the globe.A lack of clear and uniform cryptocurrency regulation — both within and across countries — creates tremendous uncertainty for long-term investors.Cryptocurrencies have failed to demonstrate either ""safe haven"" or inflation-fighting properties and are also problematic from an environmental, social and governance perspective. The collapse of FTX, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, has rippled through the world of digital currencies.Once valued at $32 billion, FTX filed for bankruptcy protection and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned as its CEO after reports alleged that the company had loaned billions of dollars in customer funds to his own trading firm, Alameda Research. This has fueled a flurry of withdrawal requests across platforms as investors braced for possible contagion.With more than $2 trillion in cryptocurrency value wiped out since the 2021 high-water mark, cryptocurrencies are suffering from a spectacular fall from grace and are now drawing increasing regulatory scrutiny and investigations around the globe.Michael Barr, the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision, said recent events in crypto markets ""have highlighted the risks to investors and consumers associated with new and novel asset classes and activities when not accompanied by strong guardrails.""

This is something we have highlighted in our conversations with clients for some time, but it bears repeating. Investors contemplating a long-term allocation to cryptocurrencies should remain wary for three primary reasons.First, a lack of clear and uniform cryptocurrency regulation — both within and across countries — creates tremendous uncertainty for long-term investors. It is still unclear in the U.S., for example, when a cryptocurrency falls under the regulatory framework of a security subject to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and when it is deemed to be an asset or commodity as proponents of bitcoin and ethereum have claimed.Indeed, in some countries, cryptocurrencies are facing outright prohibition; China's abrupt banning of all cryptocurrency trading and mining in 2021 is a prominent example, but by no means the only one. Regulators have also been concerned with the notable and repeated breakdowns in the infrastructure supporting cryptocurrency mining and trading — another area where there remains significant regulatory uncertainty. And the fallout from the FTX collapse makes one thing clear: Self-regulation and transparency are illusive. Second, despite all the hype about their being digital gold, cryptocurrencies have failed to demonstrate either ""safe haven"" or inflation-fighting properties when faced with actual market volatility or the first real bout of serious inflation in developed markets.Between 2010 and 2022, bitcoin recorded 29 episodes of drawdowns of 25% or more. By comparison, equities and commodities recorded just one each. Even in the pandemic-related market sell-off of March 2020, bitcoin suffered significantly deeper drawdowns than conventional asset classes such as equities or bonds.Similarly, while the fixed supply of bitcoin — set forth in its source code — might imply a resistance to monetary debasement, in the recent episodes of elevated global inflation, bitcoin has provided limited inflation protection with prices tumbling even as inflation spikes in the U.S., U.K. and Europe.Last, cryptocurrencies remain deeply problematic from an environmental, social and governance perspective. Most troubling are the governance issues that have been highlighted by the FTX implosion. Too often nonexistent control systems and decision-making limited to a small inner circle create a black box with no concerns for investors and their holdings. Additionally, cryptocurrencies' decentralized frameworks and anonymity make them especially attractive for illicit activity, money laundering and sanction evasion.Environmentally, even if the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake that ethereum is spearheading reduces the massive energy consumption underpinning crypto mining and validation, bitcoin — which represents about 40% of current cryptocurrency market cap — will continue to use a validation process where a single transaction requires enough energy to power the average American home for two months. And socially, cryptocurrencies' promise of financial inclusiveness also appears overblown, with crypto wealth as unequally distributed as conventional wealth, and with simple mobile-based payment services such as M-Pesa in Kenya or Grameen Bank's international remittance pilots in Bangladesh already providing a digital platform for underbanked households — without the need for a new currency or payment infrastructure.The FTX collapse has turned another bright spotlight on to cryptocurrencies, and only time will tell whether the remaining players will have what it takes to survive. Dark clouds remain on the cryptocurrency horizon that long-term investors should observe carefully from the sidelines to better understand true value vs. hype before deciding to invest in cryptocurrencies.— By Taimur Hyat, chief operating officer, PGIM"

Binance and other crypto firms are preparing takeover offers for beleaguered digital currency lender Voyager Digital after FTX, which had initially agreed to acquire the firm, filed for bankruptcy.Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which seeks to restructure troubled firms as viable business operations, in July after crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital defaulted on a loan from the company worth $670 million.Voyager was set to be acquired by FTX's American unit, FTX U.S., for $1.4 billion after Sam Bankman-Fried's firm won in a U.S. bankruptcy auction. It was then thrown back to square one after FTX itself filed for bankruptcy after experiencing its own bank run-style surge in withdrawals.Customers of Voyager have been unable to get their funds out since it paused withdrawals amid an industry-wide liquidity crisis.This week, Binance confirmed reports that its U.S. subsidiary Binance.US plans to make an offer to rescue Voyager from collapse.

One venture fund did not build the technology industry and one recovery fund will not rebuild this one.""Meanwhile, Wave Financial is also planning to make a fresh offer to acquire Voyager, after having initially lost out to FTX, according to a report from London's Financial News newspaper. Matteo Perruccio, president of international for Wave, declined to comment on the report when contacted by CNBC via WhatsApp. Last month, Perruccio told CNBC his company ""felt that our bid was better for the investors and the debtors.""Wave's bid ""saw us reinvigorating VGX,"" Voyager's exchange token, he said in the October interview.Voyager customers are hopeful that any corporate bailout of the firm will include VGX, a token that was created by Voyager as a kind of loyalty rewards program, offering discounts on trading fees.""We also had some, I think, pretty clever ideas about how to bring traffic at a much lower cost of acquisition at a higher per customer balance, which were the two big problems at Voyager,"" Perruccio told CNBC in October.In August, Voyager paused trading and transfers of VGX and outlined a plan for customers to swap their tokens for new coins on a separate blockchain. The fate of the token, which has fallen over 85% since the start of the year, remains unclear.FTX U.S. had offered to buy all the VGX held by Voyager and its affiliates for $10 million. But Voyager said it was working to find a ""higher and better solution"" for the token that was compatible with FTX U.S.' offer. FTX U.S. is now part of bankruptcy proceedings in a Delaware court, along with its parent company and other affiliates including Alameda Research. The company's offer was initially rejected by Voyager, which called it a ""low-ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue.""Another player involved in the messy restructuring process is Ethos.io, a startup Voyager had acquired in 2019. Voyager only acquired Ethos.io's technology, and the firm is planning to revive itself as a separate brand after Voyager's collapse.Shingo Lavine, co-founder of Ethos.io, says his firm's technology was core to helping Voyager build out its crypto capabilities. Voyager saw significant growth after offering support for dogecoin, a meme-inspired digital coin, he added. Adam Lavine, Shingo's father and fellow co-founder of Ethos.io, said the company has established its own recovery program for VGX holders and Voyager creditors and has ""seen a good response so far across the Voyager community.""So far, ""several thousand users representing 10% of the total VGX market cap"" have signed up to the recovery initiative, the elder Lavine said. Voyager was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC."
2022-11-28,"Crypto lender BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Monday, about two weeks after the collapse of FTX.Investor protections for crypto are different from those for more traditional holdings, such as stocks and bonds.Crypto falls in a gray area of law and regulation, according to legal experts. Investors must hope they can recover any funds in bankruptcy court. Crypto firm BlockFi filed for bankruptcy Monday, the latest cryptocurrency domino to fall after the collapse of FTX two weeks ago threatened to destabilize companies in the broader crypto ecosystem.BlockFi offers a cryptocurrency trading exchange and interest-bearing custodial service for cryptocurrencies. The distressed company — which had said it had ""significant exposure"" to FTX — said Monday it has more than 100,000 creditors, with liabilities and assets ranging from $1 billion to $10 billion.The ongoing FTX fallout — and bankruptcies earlier this year for lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital — is teaching crypto investors a hard lesson about their protections relative to more traditional asset classes. The fate of their money now lies in legal proceedings that will likely take years to play out. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ethereum and others in the digital-asset realm exist in a gray area of federal regulation, according to legal experts.That means they largely escape the same oversight as holdings such as stocks and bonds. Further, federal money isn't available to backstop customers in the same way it would be for those with holdings at a failed brokerage firm or bank. The reason largely hinges on a 1946 Supreme Court case about investors in Florida orange groves.The justices who heard that case, SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., established the so-called Howey test to determine what constitutes a security, or ""investment contract."" More on how the Howey test works can be found below.Stocks are considered securities, which are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Courts have used the Howey test to lasso some nontraditional investments — animal-breeding programs, railroads, mobile phones and internet-only enterprises, for example — under the ""investment contracts"" umbrella, thereby giving them the same protections and oversight as stock investors.Here's why this is important for crypto: It's unclear in many cases if digital assets are an ""investment contract"" under the 76-year-old Howey test.More from Personal Finance:What to know about the latest student loan payment pause3 lesser-known ways to trim your 2022 tax bill before year-endOp-ed: Cryptocurrency hasn't been a smart investment for a whileRegulatory oversight is therefore somewhat ambiguous, said Richard Painter, a securities law professor at the University of Minnesota.Experts have questioned whether it may be more appropriate to consider crypto a currency or a commodity, for example, governed by different federal regulators.""It doesn't make any sense to have all this turn on the Howey test in the 1940s-era case,"" said Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush.""It's an invitation to disaster,"" he said. ""Somebody's got to cover this.""""We know what happens with unregulated markets — ever since the 1637 tulip bulbs [mania] in Holland,"" added Painter, referring to an event widely regarded as the first documented case of a major financial bubble that bankrupted many investors. The Howey test has four parts to determine if something like bitcoin is an ""investment contract."" A contract exists if each is true:There's an investment of moneyin a common enterprisein which the investor expects a profit, andthe profit is derived solely from the efforts of others.Think of an investor who holds publicly traded stock, for example. The investor doesn't do the work to generate the company's profit, rather it is done by company employees and managers. For their part, the investor might reap profit in the form of dividends and/or a higher stock share price.But crypto is different. It's decentralized in many cases, meaning it may not be considered a ""common enterprise,"" said Daniel Gwen, business restructuring counsel at law firm Ropes & Gray. It's also unclear if its intent is always to generate a profit, since some use it to transfer funds across borders or as a ""store of value,"" for example, Gwen said.The 1946 Supreme Court case centered on the Howey Company, which cultivated orange groves and solicited investment from tourists staying at an adjoining hotel. An affiliate managed the grove on the tourists' behalf. After the orange harvest, Howey allocated a share of net profits to each buyer. The transactions ""clearly involve"" investment contracts, the court ruled.   If crypto were also a clearly defined security, the SEC would be able to police companies not complying with securities laws, said Micah Hauptman, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. Those enforcements may also have a deterrent effect on would-be bad actors, he said. There would be additional disclosures required for investors, among other protections.""It shouldn't make a difference to investors how these assets are regulated, but it does in reality,"" Hauptman said of crypto.The SEC has tried to assert its regulatory oversight in some cases. For example, the agency sued Ripple Labs and its officers in 2020 for failing to register the cryptocurrency XRP as a security offering. That case is ongoing.""I don't think you can fault regulators"" for what happened at FTX, Sheila Bair, former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told CNBC. ""They've been wanting Congress to act because there's not a lot of clarity, complete clarity, about what's a security, what's a commodity, what should be with the banking regulators."" Customers holding their crypto assets at FTX also don't appear to get the financial protection afforded to defunct brokerage firms that sell stocks, bonds and other securities.The Securities Investor Protection Corporation insures investors for up to $500,000 in the event a brokerage firm liquidates and their holdings are tied up in the insolvent firm. Let's say a Lehman Brothers customer had owned shares of a publicly traded corporate stock when the firm went bankrupt. It would be SIPC's aim to get shares back in investors' hands as quickly as possible, Gwen said.There's a similar mechanism for bank customers, who are insured for up to $250,000 by the FDIC if a bank fails.However, FTX customers likely don't have SIPC protection, Gwen said. For one, that protection applies to securities, meaning crypto's ambiguity as a security or non-security may be a hindrance. FTX itself may not be classified as a brokerage, which deals with securities products. What's more, the company is based outside the U.S., in the Bahamas, which SIPC doesn't cover, Painter said.""It does things similar to a broker-dealer,"" Gwen said of FTX. ""But the law is all over the place when it comes to [crypto].""FTX, once valued at $32 billion, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. Customers with crypto holdings must hope they can recover some — if any — money in bankruptcy court.That may be a difficult and lengthy process.""Chapter 11 is not really designed to protect this circumstance, where you have an unclear digital asset being administered almost security-like, without the same framework,"" Gwen said. ""It doesn't mean investors don't have protections; they have different protections."""
2022-11-28,"Crypto lender BlockFi has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, following the collapse of digital currency exchange FTX.BlockFi halted withdrawals before the filing, but experts say earnings from BlockFi's interest-bearing custodial service are still taxable.Despite recent losses in the crypto market, investors may have other surprise gains for 2022. Crypto firm BlockFi on Monday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, two weeks after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, further complicating taxes for investors during a difficult year.BlockFi, which offers an exchange and an interest-bearing custodial service for cryptocurrency, halted customer withdrawals before the bankruptcy filing, admitting the firm had ""significant exposure"" to FTX.However, ""all of those rewards are still taxable,"" even though investors currently can't access their earnings, said Andrew Gordon, a tax attorney, certified public accountant and president of Gordon Law Group.Officials at BlockFi did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.More from Personal Finance:As BlockFi files for bankruptcy, what to know about crypto investor protections3 lesser-known ways to trim your 2022 tax bill or boost your refundHere's why you may get a tax form for third-party payments for 2022 Despite recent losses, ""gains from earlier in the year are still on the books,"" Gordon said.Typically, crypto trading is more active when the market is going up, and that's when you are more likely to incur gains, he said.However, it's also possible to have profits even when the market drops, depending on when you bought and sold the assets. The IRS defines cryptocurrency as property for tax purposes, and you must pay levies on the difference between the purchase and sales price. While buying digital currency isn't a taxable event, you may owe levies by converting assets to cash, trading for another coin, using it to pay for goods and services, receiving payment for work and more. Since reaching an all-time high of more than $68,000 in November 2021, the price of bitcoin has dropped by more than three-quarters, approaching $16,000 as of Nov. 28.  Loading chart... If you're sitting on crypto losses, there may be a silver lining: the chance to offset 2022 gains or carry losses forward to reduce profits in future years, Gordon explained.The strategy, known as tax-loss harvesting, may apply to digital currency gains, or other assets, such as year-end mutual fund payouts. After reducing investment gains, you can use up to $3,000 of losses per year to offset regular income. And if you still want exposure to the digital asset, you can ""sell and rebuy immediately,"" said Ryan Losi, a CPA and executive vice president of CPA firm, PIASCIK.Currently, the so-called ""wash sale rule"" — which blocks investors from buying a ""substantially identical"" asset 30 days before or after the sale — doesn't apply to cryptocurrency, he said.  While crypto taxes are already complex, it's even murkier for FTX and BlockFi customers.""There are different ways it can be treated, depending on the facts of the case,"" Losi said.You may be able to claim a capital loss, or ""bad debt deduction,"" and write off what you paid for the asset. But ""it should only be done when that loss is certain,"" Gordon said.With both bankruptcy cases in limbo, customers may opt to file for a tax extension and wait for more details to emerge, Losi said.""Just like FTX we would suggest taking the 'wait and see approach' because the IRS requires that the loss is certain and in full,"" Gordon said. ""We don't know that, especially at these early stages with BlockFi."""
2022-11-28,"Crypto firm BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the wake of FTX's bankruptcy.It's the latest in a series of crypto bankruptcies, following FTX, Voyager and Celsius. Distressed crypto firm BlockFi has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey following the implosion of putative acquirer FTX.In the filing, the company indicated that it had more than 100,000 creditors, with liabilities and assets ranging from $1 billion to $10 billion. The company also listed an outstanding $275 million loan to FTX US, the American arm of Sam Bankman-Fried's now-bankrupt empire.A BlockFi subsidiary also moved for bankruptcy in Bermuda concurrently with the American filing.Bermuda, like the Bahamas, has embraced crypto as the future of finance. Both established frameworks to deal specifically with crypto assets and digital currencies. Both the Bahamas, with FTX's bankruptcy, and now Bermuda, with BlockFi's, face the first significant legal tests of their crypto regulations.BlockFi's bankruptcy filing shows that the company's largest disclosed client has a balance of nearly $28 million.""BlockFi looks forward to a transparent process that achieves the best outcome for all clients and other stakeholders,"" Berkeley Research Group's Mark Renzi said in a press statement. BRG serves as BlockFi's financial advisor.The crypto company, which offers a trading exchange and interest-bearing custodial service for cryptocurrencies, was one of many firms to face serious liquidity issues after the implosion of Three Arrows Capital.The Jersey City, New Jersey-based company had already halted withdrawals of customer deposits and admitted that it had ""significant exposure"" to the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading house, Alameda Research. ""We do have significant exposure to FTX and associated corporate entities that encompasses obligations owed to us by Alameda, assets held at FTX.com, and undrawn amounts from our credit line with FTX.US,"" BlockFi previously said.The company started talking with restructuring professionals in the days after FTX's bankruptcy filing, according to people familiar with the matter.A representative from BlockFi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.BlockFi — which was last valued at $4.8 billion, according to PitchBook — is among many crypto firms feeling the pressure of FTX's collapse. In July, FTX swooped in to help BlockFi stave off bankruptcy by extending a $400 million revolving credit facility and offering to potentially buy the beleaguered lender.Sam Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Nov. 11, and the contagion effect across the crypto sector has been swift.Approximately 130 additional affiliated companies are part of the proceedings, including Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's crypto trading firm, and FTX.us, the company's U.S. subsidiary. FTX's new CEO John Ray said in a filing with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court that ""in his 40 years of legal and restructuring experience,"" he had never seen ""such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.""Ray formerly served as CEO of Enron after the implosion of the energy titan. In a matter of days, FTX went from a $32 billion valuation to bankruptcy as liquidity dried up, customers demanded withdrawals and rival exchange Binance ripped up its nonbinding agreement to buy the company. Gross negligence has since been exposed. Ray added that a ""substantial portion"" of assets held with FTX may be ""missing or stolen.""FTX has more than 1 million creditors, according to updated bankruptcy filings, hinting at the huge impact of its collapse on crypto traders and other counterparties with ties to Bankman-Fried's empire. Correction: A subsidiary of BlockFi also moved for bankruptcy in Bermuda, not the Bahamas."
2022-11-30,"The Charity Commission for England and Wales told CNBC that one of the charities there filed a ""serious incident report"" tied to ""the collapse of FTX.""Former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried's donations are at least in the multiple millions of dollars with public pledges to give billions more to the so-called effective altruism movement. But the implosion of his firms amid a tsunami of new legal troubles casts doubt on the future of the charities he helped underwrite. A charity backed by Sam Bankman-Fried and his failed cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, has sounded alarms to regulators in the United Kingdom that raise questions about the viability of the nonprofits he's funded.The Charity Commission for England and Wales, a U.K. agency that regulates nonprofits, said one of the charities there filed a ""serious incident report"" tied to ""the collapse of FTX,"" according to an email sent Wednesday in response to questions from CNBC.Lawyers for FTX have said the company was ""effectively run as a personal fiefdom of Sam Bankman-Fried."" The founder and former CEO is facing a barrage of civil and reportedly criminal investigations after transferring billions in customer funds from FTX, the crypto trading platform he founded in 2019, to Alameda Research, a crypto trading firm he founded in 2017. Questions about the stability of FTX's holdings caused a liquidity run that put both companies into bankruptcy earlier this month.Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda Research, among other entities he controlled, helped finance the Oxford-based Centre for Effective Altruism, which is now called the Effective Ventures Foundation, the Britain-based charity network that filed the report with the commission. Bankman-Fried also served as the treasurer of the centre's U.S. arm from 2013 through 2015 and sat on its board from 2016 through 2018, according to its tax filings with the IRS.Bankman-Fried's donations are at least in the multiple millions of dollars with public pledges to give billions more. But the implosion of his firms amid a tsunami of new legal troubles casts doubt on the future of the charities he helped underwrite.""We can confirm that in line with our guidance, Effective Ventures Foundation (of which the Centre for Effective Altruism is a project) has filed a serious incident report relating to the collapse of FTX,"" said Polly Kettenacker, a spokeswoman for the Charity Commission, declining to disclose further details. ""We are engaging with the charity around this matter.""  The commission didn't specify why it filed the report, but nonprofits in the United Kingdom are required to submit serious incident reports in a handful of circumstances, including the ""loss of your charity's money or assets"" or ""harm to your charity's work or reputation,"" according to the group's website.The charities Bankman-Fried backed were boosting the so-called effective altruism movement, which claims to use research and data to find the best ways to help others. However, the movement has more often been criticized as a public relations ploy used by the superrich to convince people they're helping society by donating some of their money to worthy social causes.""Effective Ventures has in the past received grants from Alameda Research and FTX/Alameda employees. We also received donations from FTX Future Fund and related individuals and organizations,"" spokesman Shakeel Hashim confirmed in an email. ""We used these funds to support our charitable operations."" Hashim said that ""Effective Ventures"" is an umbrella for two charitable organizations, Effective Ventures Foundation in the U.K. and the Centre for Effective Altruism US.He didn't say how much those groups donated or respond to follow up questions about the ""serious incident report"" his group filed to the British charity regulator.Alameda Research has donated grant money to the group since 2017, the same year the firm was launched by Bankman-Fried, according to the charity's U.K. financial records.The FTX Future Fund, the crypto exchange's philanthropic arm, boasts on its website that, as of June, it's donated $34 million toward causes tied to effective altruism. The Centre For Effective Altruism has received approximately $14 million from the Future Fund, according to the fund's website. The Future Fund says its ""funded primarily"" by Bankman-Fried ""with major contributions"" from Alameda Research's former CEO Caroline Ellison as well as Gary Wang, who co-founded Alameda and FTX with Bankman-Fried, and Nishad Singh, the former director of engineering at FTX.Bankman-Fried personally committed $16.5 billion from himself and FTX to effective altruism charities, according to a slide from conference about the philanthropies last year in London. In 2021 alone, the Centre For Effective Altruism USA collected 102 crypto donations worth a fair market value of $9 million, according to tax filings. That accounted for almost half of the $17 million the group raised that year, according to the records.The young CEO often boasted in meetings with U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill in Washington about his philanthropic endeavors while advocating for the crypto industry, according to a crypto executive who was at some of the private gatherings. Bankman-Fried wanted to convince them he's using his wealth for good causes, this person said."
2022-11-30,"The Bitcoin Family has relocated to Phuket, and they are in the process of moving $1 million in crypto to decentralized exchanges.Currently, the family keeps 73% of its crypto tokens in cold storage.Decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, allow users to retain custody of their coins. Confidence is quickly eroding in the crypto sector, as it faces a wave of bankruptcies and investigations into Sam Bankman-Fried and his failed exchange, FTX, for losing and misspending billions of dollars in user deposits.But Didi Taihuttu; his wife, Romaine; three daughters, and Teddy, a Pomeranian puppy they adopted in Portugal last year, are as confident as ever in their bet on bitcoin — they're just changing how they store it.Ever since liquidating all of their assets and buying bitcoin in 2017 back when it was trading at around $900, the Taihuttus have safeguarded their crypto riches in three main places: centralized exchanges, or CEXs, such as Bybit and Kraken; decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, such as Uniswap; and hardware wallets hidden in secret vaults on four different continents.But as digital asset brokers, lenders, and exchanges continue to fall into bankruptcy — locking up customer funds in the process — the Dutch family of five is proactively moving $1 million in crypto into DEXs, which allow users to hang on to custody of their tokens.""For me, bitcoin is still about freedom, and decentralized currency should be able to be used by everyone in the world without needing to do KYC or any other regulatory stuff,"" Didi Taihuttu told CNBC, referring to the know-your-customer, or KYC compliance, required by many centralized platforms such as Coinbase. DEXs don't require users to connect an ID or bank account to the platform, hence making it an ideal custody solution for the Taihuttus. CNBC caught up with the 44-year-old patriarch a few days after the family made the move from Lagos, Portugal, to Phuket, an island just off the western coast of mainland Thailand in the Andaman Sea. The family is currently living on 0.3 bitcoin a month — about $5,000 — and they are buying back the bitcoin that they sold when the cryptocurrency was trading at around $55,000 a year ago. For the Taihuttus, the cascade of crypto bankruptcies and failed tokens just shows that ""bitcoin is the king"" and ""completely different than all the other projects,"" Didi Taihuttu said.While the Taihuttus did not have any tokens tied up with FTX, Celsius, Voyager Digital, or any of the other platforms that recently went under, the wave of failures did remind them of the importance of ownership.

That means that users retain custody of their tokens by never handing over their private keys.DEXs eliminate centralized intermediaries from financial transactions such as trading, holding and transferring assets through programmable pieces of code known as smart contracts. These contracts are written on a public blockchain such as ethereum, and execute when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary. In essence, with DEXs, you trust code, and with CEXs, you trust people.""You never send your bitcoin to an exchange. Your bitcoin stays in your own wallet, meaning you have complete custody of your coins,"" explained Taihuttu. ""You connect to a DEX, and by making that connection, you trade out of your own wallet.""That nuance of ownership is critical.""If the DEX collapses, it doesn't matter, because the bitcoin are always in your own wallet,"" he added. From the beginning, Taihuttu said he could tell something was ""really off"" with FTX, even though it was one of the biggest CEXs on the planet before it imploded in November.""Too many influencers were paid too much money to promote that one,"" said Taihuttu, who added that reliable crypto products and companies typically don't rely so heavily on celebrity endorsements.Taihuttu had learned his lesson in 2017, when he lost four bitcoin to a hack of a centralized exchange known as Cryptopia.""From that moment, I was always searching for alternatives,"" he said. People who choose to hold their own cryptocurrency can store it ""hot,"" ""cold,"" or some combination of the two. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and allows owners relatively easy access to their coins so they can spend their crypto. The trade-off for convenience is potential exposure to bad actors.""Cold storage often refers to crypto that has been moved to wallets whose private keys — the passwords that enable the crypto to be moved out of the wallet — are not stored on internet-connected computers, so that hackers can't hack into the computer and steal the private keys,"" said Philip Gradwell, chief economist of Chainalysis, a blockchain data firm.Thumb drive-size devices such as a Trezor or Ledger offer a way to secure crypto tokens ""cold."" Square is also building a hardware wallet and service ""to make bitcoin custody more mainstream."" The Taihuttu family has largely relied on cold storage to safeguard their tokens for the last six years.Currently, the Taihuttus keep 27% of their crypto holdings ""hot"" on centralized exchanges such as Bybit, a platform Taihuttu said is transparent and backed by real assets. He also keeps some tokens on Kraken, since it is one of the oldest exchanges. He refers to this crypto stash as his ""risk capital,"" and he uses these crypto coins for day trading and potentially precarious bets.The other 73% of the Taihuttus' total crypto portfolio is in cold storage. These cold hardware wallets, which are spread around the globe, hold bitcoin, ether and some litecoin.  The family declined to say how much it holds in crypto, but they did disclose that they are shifting $1 million worth of bitcoin, ether, litecoin, polkadot, and other tokens from these hardware wallets and centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges.Taihuttu said he ultimately wants to move 100% of the family's crypto savings into DEXs and invest 15% of their net worth into upstart DEXs since he sees these decentralized platforms as the centerpiece of the next bull run. When asked why he is going all in on DEXs instead of keeping his crypto cold, Taihuttu pointed to ease of access.DEXs allow him to connect the crypto he safeguards on thumb drives in hiding spots all over the world directly to the platform, meaning that he can make trades far more easily while still protecting his tokens.""Our capital now is really difficult to use in trading, because then I need to send my bitcoin from my ledger into an exchange,"" Taihuttu said.The financial privacy offered by DEXs is also a huge incentive.""You're trading from an anonymous ledger on an exchange as an anonymous entity,"" he said. ""You get full access to non-KYC trading in a decentralized way on a DEX.""Taihuttu isn't alone in shifting his focus to DEXs. Following the FTX bankruptcy, Trezor's sales revenue reportedly jumped 300% and billions of dollars in bitcoin fled exchanges. Meanwhile, Multicoin Capital, a crypto investment firm, told limited partners that 7% of its assets are similarly stored cold, in self-custodied wallets. Centralized exchanges are a big part of what helped spur crypto adoption by offering new investors an easy on-ramp.""Centralized exchanges have played a vital role in the adoption of cryptocurrency,"" said Auston Bunsen, co-founder of QuikNode, which provides blockchain infrastructure to developers and companies. ""With their growth came the industry's growth.""But in the last few years, and especially in the last six months, decentralized exchanges have grown in popularity as investors look to trade in a manner that protects their funds.Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst, sees three main advantages to DEXs: They are noncustodial, meaning you don't have to trust someone, like Sam Bankman-Fried, to store your funds for you; they are open, meaning anyone in the world can participate; and transaction data is more widely available, reducing the risk of insiders getting an edge from knowledge only they have. Uniswap has facilitated more than $1 trillion in trading volume from around 100 million trades since it launched in 2018, according to a research note from Bank of America on June 13. Rival DEXs such as SushiSwap and PancakeSwap have also gained traction among traders, though Uniswap still accounts for around 51% of all trading volumes on DEXs year to date.While DEXs play an important role in the digital asset ecosystem, there are a lot of reasons these decentralized platforms won't eclipse their centralized peers any time soon, according to Alkesh Shah, Bank of America's head of web3, crypto and digital assets strategy.""Centralized exchanges provide a one-stop shop for investing or trading digital assets with someone to speak to if something goes wrong — this will be critical for mainstream adoption beyond the early adopters of today,"" Shah told CNBC.Shah said that investors are likely to prefer exchanges that are more transparent about their operating practices, adding that regulated and transparent CEXs are likely to be important for mainstream adoption long-term.Bank of America said in its June note that it expected Uniswap, in particular, to face regulatory scrutiny. The bank said it also saw the potential for the Securities and Exchange Commission to require its registration as a National Securities Exchange or broker-dealer. ""Uniswap may be unable to comply with regulatory requirements, given its inability to verify user identities, implement AML/KYC [anti-money laundering/know your customer] requirements or provide the necessary disclosures for the thousands of tokens listed on its platform,"" the research note said.Some centralized platforms are splitting the difference by offering DEX-type services, but it is unclear what sort of regulatory blowback they might ultimately face.Meanwhile, Sobrado told CNBC that at this stage, most DEXs lose money, meaning they might not be sustainable.DEXs are also automated market makers, meaning that the exchange pools liquidity from its users and then uses an algorithm to price the assets within that pool. Sobrado said that this model has proven remarkably resilient — but is unproven versus orderbook exchanges such as Coinbase.Under it all, the Bitcoin Family still believes that the original cryptocurrency is a solid bet. They say they haven't been swayed by the turmoil of the last six months.""We seem to get that lesson every bitcoin cycle,"" said Taihuttu. ""It was Mt. Gox, it was banning bitcoin in China, it was banning mining. There's drama every time.""""But looking at the current situation: We have a huge war going on, we have a huge financial crisis, we have FTX, we have Celsius, we have a lot of bear market signals,"" he said. ""I think that bitcoin is really holding strong at $16,800. For me, bitcoin is still doing perfect and still doing what it always does: Being a decentralized currency that is usable by all people all over the world."" Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the family currently keeps 73% of its crypto tokens in cold storage. A previous key point gave an incorrect percentage."

Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, warned that the bounce is likely just a bear market rally and would not be sustained. ""This is just a bearish retest,"" he told CNBC.The remarks from the ECB officials are timely, with the crypto industry reeling from one of its most catastrophic failures in recent history — the downfall of FTX, an exchange once valued at $32 billion. And the market has been largely down in the dumps this year amid higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve.Bindseil and Schaff said that bitcoin didn't fit the mold of an investment and wasn't suitable as a means of payment, either.""Bitcoin's conceptual design and technological shortcomings make it questionable as a means of payment: real Bitcoin transactions are cumbersome, slow and expensive,"" they wrote. ""Bitcoin has never been used to any significant extent for legal real-world transactions."" ""Bitcoin is also not suitable as an investment. It does not generate cash flow (like real estate) or dividends (like equities), cannot be used productively (like commodities) or provide social benefits (like gold). The market valuation of Bitcoin is therefore based purely on speculation,"" they added.Analysts say that FTX's insolvency is likely to hasten regulation of digital currencies. In the European Union, a new law called Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA, is expected to harmonize regulation of digital assets across the bloc.Bindseil and Schaff said it was important not to mistake regulation as a sign of approval.""The belief that space must be given to innovation at all costs stubbornly persists,"" they said.""Firstly, these technologies have so far created limited value for society — no matter how great the expectations for the future. Secondly, the use of a promising technology is not a sufficient condition for an added value of a product based on it.""They also raised concerns with bitcoin's poor environmental credentials. The cryptocurrency's technical underpinnings are such that it requires a massive amount of computing power in order to verify and approve new transactions. Ethereum, the network behind bitcoin rival ether, recently transitioned to a new framework that backers say would cut its energy consumption by more than 99%.""This inefficiency of the system is not a flaw but a feature,"" Bindseil and Schaff said. ""It is one of the peculiarities to guarantee the integrity of the completely decentralised system.""It's not the first time the ECB has raised doubts about digital currencies. ECB President Christine Lagarde in May said she thinks cryptocurrencies are ""worth nothing."" Her comments came on the back of a separate scandal for the industry — the multibillion-dollar implosion of so-called stablecoin terraUSD.— CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report."
2022-12-05,"CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday told investors that they still have time to sell their cryptocurrency holdings.""It's never too late to sell an awful position, and that's what you have if you own these so-called digital assets,"" he said. CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday told investors that they still have time to sell their cryptocurrency holdings.""You can't just beat yourself up and say, 'hey, it's too late to sell.'

2022-12-05,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is already under investigation by numerous agencies, but arresting him isn't going to be straightforward.The former crypto titan has the SEC, CFTC, SDNY and DOJ on his case, but it'll take months if not years to fully assemble all the evidence.As FTX moves through bankruptcy protection, private citizens can file suit against Bankman-Fried, even if the former billionaire claims he's down to his last $100,000. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO of FTX — the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange that was worth $32 billion a few weeks ago — has a real knack for self-promotional PR. For years, he cast himself in the likeness of a young boy genius turned business titan, capable of miraculously growing his crypto empire as other players got wiped out. Everyone from Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists to A-list celebrities bought the act.But during Bankman-Fried's press junket of the last few weeks, the onetime wunderkind has spun a new narrative – one in which he was simply an inexperienced and novice businessman who was out of his depth, didn't know what he was doing, and crucially, didn't know what was happening at the businesses he founded.It is quite the departure from the image he had carefully cultivated since launching his first crypto firm in 2017 – and according to former federal prosecutors, trial attorneys and legal experts speaking to CNBC, it recalls a classic legal defense dubbed the ""bad businessman strategy."" At least $8 billion in customer funds are missing, reportedly used to backstop billions in losses at Alameda Research, the hedge fund he also founded. Both of his companies are now bankrupt with billions of dollars worth of debt on the books. The CEO tapped to take over, John Ray III, said that ""in his 40 years of legal and restructuring experience,"" he had never seen ""such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here."" This is the same Ray who presided over Enron's liquidation in the 2000s.In America, it is not a crime to be a lousy or careless CEO with poor judgement. During his recent press tour from a remote location in the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried really leaned into his own ineptitude, largely blaming FTX's collapse on poor risk management.At least a dozen times in a conversation with Andrew Ross Sorkin, he appeared to deflect blame to Caroline Ellison, his counterpart (and one-time girlfriend) at Alameda. He says didn't know how extremely leveraged Alameda was, and that he just didn't know about a lot of things going on at his vast empire.Bankman-Fried admitted he had a ""bad month,"" but denied committing fraud at his crypto exchange.Fraud is the kind of criminal charge that can put you behind bars for life. With Bankman-Fried, the question is whether he misled FTX customers to believe their money was available, and not being used as collateral for loans or for other purposes, according to Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor and trial attorney who has represented clients in derivative-related claims and securities class actions.""It sure looks like there's a chargeable fraud case here,"" said Mariotti. ""If I represented Mr. Bankman-Fried, I would tell him he should be very concerned about prison time. That it should be an overriding concern for him.""But for the moment, Bankman-Fried appears unconcerned with his personal legal exposure. When Sorkin asked him if he was concerned about criminal liability, he demurred.""I don't think that — obviously, I don't personally think that I have — I think the real answer is it's not — it sounds weird to say it, but I think the real answer is it's not what I'm focusing on,"" Bankman-Fried told Sorkin. ""It's — there's going to be a time and a place for me to think about myself and my own future. But I don't think this is it.""Comments such as these, paired with the lack of apparent action by regulators or authorities, have helped inspire fury among many in the industry – not just those who lost their money. The spectacular collapse of FTX and SBF blindsided investors, customers, venture capitalists and Wall Street alike.Bankman-Fried did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for his former law firm, Paul, Weiss, did not immediately respond to comment. Semafor reported earlier that Bankman-Fried's new attorney was Greg Joseph, a partner at Joseph Hage Aaronson.Both of Bankman-Fried's parents are highly respected Stanford Law School professors. Semafor also reported that another Stanford Law professor, David Mills, was advising Bankman-Fried.Mills, Joseph and Bankman-Fried's parents did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bankman-Fried could face a host of potential charges – civil and criminal – as well as private lawsuits from millions of FTX creditors, legal experts told CNBC.For now, this is all purely hypothetical. Bankman-Fried has not been charged, tried, nor convicted of any crime yet.Richard Levin is a partner at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough, where he chairs the fintech and regulation practice. He's been involved in the fintech industry since the early 1990s, and has represented clients before the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Congress. All three of those entities have begun probing Bankman-Fried.There are three different, possibly simultaneous legal threats that Bankman-Fried faces in the United States alone, Levin told CNBC.First is criminal action from the U.S. Department of Justice, for potential ""criminal violations of securities laws, bank fraud laws, and wire fraud laws,"" Levin said.A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment.Securing a conviction is always challenging in a criminal case.Mariotti, the former federal prosecutor is intricately familiar with how the government would build a case. He told CNBC, ""prosecutors would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bankman-Fried or his associates committed criminal fraud.""""The argument would be that Alameda was tricking these people into getting their money so they could use it to prop up a different business,"" Mariotti said.""If you're a hedge fund and you're accepting customer funds, you actually have a fiduciary duty [to the customer],"" Mariotti said.Prosecutors could argue that FTX breached that fiduciary duty by allegedly using customer funds to artificially stabilize the price of FTX's own FTT coin, Mariotti said.But intent is also a factor in fraud cases, and Bankman-Fried insists he didn't know about potentially fraudulent activity. He told Sorkin that he ""didn't knowingly commingle funds.""""I didn't ever try to commit fraud,"" Bankman-Fried said.Beyond criminal charges, Bankman-Fried could also be facing civil enforcement action. ""That could be brought by the Securities Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and by state banking and securities regulators,"" Levin continued.""On a third level, there's also plenty of class actions that can be brought, so there are multiple levels of potential exposure for [...] the executives involved with FTX,"" Levin concluded. The Department of Justice is most likely to pursue criminal charges in the U.S. The Wall Street Journal reported that the DOJ and the SEC were both probing FTX's collapse, and were in close contact with each other.That kind of cooperation allows for criminal and civil probes to proceed simultaneously, and allows regulators and law enforcement to gather information more effectively.But it isn't clear whether the SEC or the CFTC will take the lead in securing civil damages.An SEC spokesperson said the agency does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation. The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""The question of who would be taking the lead there, whether it be the SEC or CFTC, depends on whether or not there were securities involved,"" Mariotti, the former federal prosecutor, told CNBC.SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who met with Bankman-Fried and FTX executives in spring 2022, has said publicly that ""many crypto tokens are securities,"" which would make his agency the primary regulator. But many exchanges, including FTX, have crypto derivatives platforms that sell financial products like futures and options, which fall under the CFTC's jurisdiction.""For selling unregistered securities without a registration or an exemption, you could be looking at the Securities Exchange Commission suing for disgorgement — monetary penalties,"" said Levin, who's represented clients before both agencies.""They can also sue, possibly, claiming that FTX was operating an unregistered securities market,"" Levin said.Then there are the overseas regulators that oversaw any of the myriad FTX subsidiaries.The Securities Commission of The Bahamas believes it has jurisdiction, and went as far as to file a separate case in New York bankruptcy court. That case has since been folded into FTX's main bankruptcy protection proceedings, but Bahamian regulators continue to investigate FTX's activities.Court filings allege that Bahamian regulators have moved customer digital assets from FTX custody into their own. Bahamian regulators insist that they're proceeding by the book, under the country's groundbreaking crypto regulations — unlike many nations, the Bahamas has a robust legal framework for digital assets. But crypto investors aren't sold on their competence.""The Bahamas clearly lack the institutional infrastructure to tackle a fraud this complex and have been completely derelict in their duty,"" Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter told CNBC. (Carter was not an FTX investor, and told CNBC that his fund passed on early FTX rounds.)""There is no question of standing. U.S. courts have obvious access points here and numerous parts of Sam's empire touched the U.S. Every day the U.S. leaves this in the hands of the Bahamas is a lost opportunity,"" he continued.Investors who have lost their savings aren't waiting. Class-action suits have already been filed against FTX endorsers, like comedian Larry David and football superstar Tom Brady. One suit excoriated the celebrity endorsers for allegedly failing to do their ""due diligence prior to marketing [FTX] to the public.""FTX's industry peers are also filing suit against Bankman-Fried. BlockFi sued Bankman-Fried in November, seeking unnamed collateral that the former billionaire provided for the crypto lending firm.FTX and Bankman-Fried had previously rescued BlockFi from insolvency in June, but when FTX failed, BlockFi was left with a similar liquidity problem and filed for bankruptcy protection in New Jersey.Bankman-Fried has also been sued in Florida and California federal courts. He faces class-action suits in both states over ""one of the great frauds in history,"" a California court filing said.The largest securities class-action settlement was for $7.2 billion in the Enron accounting fraud case, according to Stanford research. The possibility of a multibillion-dollar settlement would come on top of civil and criminal fines that Bankman-Fried faces.But the onus should be on the U.S. government to pursue Bankman-Fried, Carter told CNBC, not on private investors or overseas regulators.""The U.S. isn't shy about using foreign proxies to go after Assange — why in this case have they suddenly found their restraint?"" Wire fraud is the most likely criminal charge Bankman-Fried would face. If the DOJ were able to secure a conviction, a judge would look to several factors to determine how long to sentence him.Braden Perry was once a senior trial lawyer for the CFTC, FTX's only official U.S. regulator. He's now a partner at Kennyhertz Perry, where he advises clients on anti-money laundering, compliance and enforcement issues.Based on the size of the losses, if Bankman-Fried is convicted of fraud or other charges, he could be behind bars for years — potentially for the rest of his life, Perry said. But the length of any potential sentence is hard to predict.""In the federal system, each crime always has a starting point,"" Perry told CNBC.Federal sentencing guidelines follow a numeric system to determine the maximum and minimum allowable sentence, but the system can be esoteric. The scale, or ""offense level,"" starts at one, and maxes out at 43.A wire fraud conviction rates as a seven on the scale, with a minimum sentence ranging from zero to six months.But mitigating factors and enhancements can alter that rating, Perry told CNBC.""The dollar value of loss plays a significant role. Under the guidelines, any loss above $550 million adds 30 points to the base level offense,"" Perry said. FTX customers have lost billions.""Having 25 or more victims adds 6 points, [and] use of certain regulated markets adds 4,"" Perry continued.In this hypothetical scenario, Bankman-Fried would max out the scale at 43, based on those enhancements. That means Bankman-Fried could be facing life in federal prison, without the possibility of supervised release, if he's convicted on a single wire fraud offense.But that sentence can be reduced by mitigating factors – circumstances that would lessen the severity of any alleged crimes.""In practice, many white-collar defendants are sentenced to lesser sentences than what the guidelines dictate,"" Perry told CNBC, Even in large fraud cases, that 30-point enhancement previously mentioned can be considered punitive.By way of comparison, Stefan Qin, the Australian founder of a $90 million cryptocurrency hedge fund, was sentenced to more than seven years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud. Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, a Swedish national accused by the United States of defrauding over 3,500 victims of more than $16 million was sentenced to 15 years in prison for securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.Bankman-Fried could also face massive civil fines. Bankman-Fried was once a multibillionaire, but claimed he was down to his last $100,000 in a conversation with CNBC's Sorkin at the DealBook Summit last week.""Depending on what is discovered as part of the investigations by law enforcement and the civil authorities, you could be looking at both heavy monetary penalties and potential incarceration for decades,"" Levin told CNBC. Whatever happens won't happen quickly.In the most famous fraud case in recent years, Bernie Madoff was arrested within 24 hours of federal authorities learning of his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. But Madoff was in New York and admitted to his crime on the spot.The FTX founder is in the Bahamas and hasn't admitted wrongdoing. Short of a voluntary return, any efforts to apprehend him would require extradition.With hundreds of subsidiaries and bank accounts, and thousands of creditors, it'll take prosecutors and regulators time to work through everything.Similar cases ""took years to put together,"" said Mariotti. At FTX, where record keeping was spotty at best, collecting enough data to prosecute could be much harder. Expenses were reportedly handled through messaging software, for example, making it difficult to pinpoint how and when money flowed out for legitimate expenses.In Enron's bankruptcy, senior executives weren't charged until nearly three years after the company went under. That kind of timeline infuriates some in the crypto community.""The fact that Sam is still walking free and unencumbered, presumably able to cover his tracks and destroy evidence, is a travesty,"" said Carter.But just because law enforcement is tight-lipped, that doesn't mean they're standing down.""People should not jump to the conclusion that something is not happening just because it has not been publicly disclosed,"" Levin told CNBC.Could he just disappear?""That's always a possibility with the money that someone has,"" Perry said, although Bankman-Fried claims he's down to one working credit card. But Perry doesn't think it's likely. ""I believe that there has been likely some negotiation with his attorneys, and the prosecutors and other regulators that are looking into this, to ensure them that when the time comes [...] he's not fleeing somewhere,"" Perry told CNBC.In the meantime, Bankman-Fried won't be resting easy as he waits for the hammer to drop. Rep. Maxine Waters extended a Twitter invitation for him to appear before a Dec. 13 hearing.Bankman-Fried responded on Twitter, telling Waters that if he understands what happened at FTX by then, he'd appear.Correction: Caroline Ellison is Bankman-Fried's counterpart at Alameda. An earlier version misspelled her name."
2022-12-05,"Rob Nichols is the president and CEO of the American Bankers Association and Dennis Kelleher is president and CEO of Better Markets, a Washington-based nonprofit that promotes financial markets reform.    The recent turmoil in the trillion-dollar crypto sector, including FTX's sudden liquidity crisis and spectacular collapse, has updated the concept of a bank run — made famous in movies like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Mary Poppins."" But this time, the run hasn't been on a bank at all.   Instead, many crypto-asset customers had accounts at nonbank crypto firms. When they ran (that is, when they simultaneously rushed to make large-scale withdrawals), the customers found their withdrawals slowed and then frozen by the firms in a desperate attempt to remain solvent. Customers were forced to watch helplessly as their accounts plummeted to zero. This is very similar to what happened at nonbank financial firms during the 2008 financial crash and would have happened when the 2020 pandemic hit if the Fed had not acted so quickly. The recent bankruptcies of crypto lenders Voyager and Celsius — and at the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD — make the risks of nonbanks painfully clear for the consumers who lost billions in uninsured crypto accounts and investors who have lost trillions of dollars. And now, the largely unregulated nonbank FTX, which had multiple crypto business activities spanning the globe, saw $6 billion in withdrawals in 72 hours and has collapsed entirely amid the potential for law enforcement and congressional investigations. The 2008 financial crash and the 2020 pandemic-caused crisis already proved that nonbanks are not mere fringe players in our global financial system; they are critically important and deeply interconnected to the banking system and economy and can threaten financial stability.  And they are growing in importance: nonbank financial intermediation (sometimes called ""shadow banking"") accounts for nearly half of $470 trillion in global financial assets, according to the Financial Stability Board's most recent report. More recently, the growth of the trillion-dollar crypto sector — with its many asset types, exchanges and wallets, intersecting with mainstream finance in a number of ways — has created a whole new field of unregulated nonbank players.   Our organizations don't always agree on banking policy. But today, as the warning lights blink on the economic dashboard and we confront both persistent inflation and the risk of a recession in the months ahead, we both agree that crypto companies and other nonbanks pose a significant and increasing risk to our financial system that needs to be better understood and regulated.    The critical overriding principle to getting the shadow banking system on safer ground is this: apply the same regulatory standards to the same products and services, regardless of origin or the technology involved.   Americans should know that when they engage in any financial activity, be it a checking account or a credit card or a car loan, or invest in a digital asset, that they have the same fundamental consumer, investor and financial stability protections — regardless of who offers the product or service. It wouldn't make sense to say that cars built in a unionized factory must have seatbelts, while cars built in a non-union shop could go seatbelt-free — instead, our auto regulators set uniform standards for vehicles regardless of who makes them, how, or where.  That means the providers of these products — banks and nonbanks alike — should be subject to the same underwriting requirements, the same regulatory and risk management standards, the same cybersecurity and anti-fraud protections, and the same consumer protection standards. Despite our disagreements on some other banking issues, we share this common ground: the same activity should face the same regulation.   The ""same risk, same rule"" principle ensures a competitive marketplace with a level playing field where incentives for regulatory arbitrage are minimized if not eliminated. If you want to serve consumers through the payments system, through deposit products or loans, or through asset management and trade facilitation, you should be subject to the same requirements as all other participants.   This principle also provides policymakers a better window on systemic risk—making sure that we don't let an economy-wrecking level of risk-taking build up outside of the regulated banking sector as grievously happened in 2008. Like the proverbial man searching for his glasses under the streetlight ""because that's where the light is,"" evaluating financial stability shouldn't mean that policymakers should only look for systemic risks in the entities they directly regulate.   Finally, this principle doesn't mean that a company has to be a bank to offer financial products or services. That's a decision that involves business models, funding, governance and other strategic considerations. There are good reasons for financial intermediaries to be banks, and there are legitimate reasons for some companies to offer financial products or services outside the banking system. But while the institution type may vary, the safeguards must be aligned. Innovation in the financial sector is critical to maximizing benefits for consumers, and fair, properly and consistently regulated competition can drive this process forward. But consumers also expect that the rules that govern providers — whether bank or nonbank — protect them and financial stability.    As the unseen risks of more unregulated nonbanks materialize and the shadows of an economic recession lengthen around the world, it's more critical than ever to bring crypto and other shadow banks into the light.    "
2022-12-06,"When it came to pitching banking services to the crypto community, Silvergate Bank held an ace card: an endorsement from none other than Sam Bankman-Fried, the celebrity founder of FTX, a large and popular crypto exchange.""Life as a crypto firm can be divided up into before Silvergate and after Silvergate,"" Bankman-Fried gushed in a testimonial featured recently, and prominently, on Silvergate Bank's website. ""It's hard to overstate how much it revolutionized banking for blockchain companies.""Now, with billions of dollars missing from a bankrupt FTX's coffers, Bankman-Fried's tribute has vanished from San Diego-based Silvergate's website. Silvergate's role as a banker to FTX and other Bankman-Fried entities is raising questions for Alan Lane, its chief executive, and creating headaches for the institution's public shareholders.More from NBC News:Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX collapse, explainedSam Bankman-Fried says he didn't 'try to commit fraud'Hackers linked to China stole millions in Covid benefitsLate Monday, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Senate banking committee, and two Republican colleagues sent Lane and Silvergate a request for information about the bank's relationship with FTX and the Bankman-Fried entities.""In the weeks since FTX's shocking collapse, new and disturbing allegations about the company's business practices have continued to surface,"" the letter said, ""including the reports that Mr. Bankman-Fried 'secretly transferred some $10 billion of customer funds to his trading vehicle, Alameda Research,' to fund 'risky bets,' violating both U.S. securities laws and FTX's own terms of service. We are concerned about Silvergate's role in these activities because of reports suggesting that Silvergate facilitated the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda.""The letter, co-signed by Republican Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Roger Marshall of Kansas, also questioned Silvergate's vigilance in flagging suspicious activities in client accounts as it is required to do under banking regulations.""Your bank's involvement in the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda reveals what appears to be an egregious failure of your bank's responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients,"" the letter said. Silvergate has until Dec. 19 to respond to the lawmakers.Silvergate is one of only a handful of U.S. banks allowing customers to move dollars or other so-called fiat currencies onto crypto exchanges. FTX and related companies, including Alameda Research, its hedge fund and proprietary trading firm, held 20 different accounts at Silvergate, according to a recent FTX bankruptcy filing. Billions of dollars in wire transfers sluiced through Silvergate to FTX Group in recent years, according to a lawsuit filed against Bankman-Fried and his top executives.It is not yet clear what transpired at FTX, Alameda and other affiliated entities or where the billions of dollars in missing customer funds wound up. But in a conversation with an investment manager, a former top FTX employee said Silvergate was FTX's primary banking partner. In the conversation, a recording of which was shared with NBC News, the former employee described transfers of funds between FTX's Silvergate account, which included FTX customers' money, and accounts belonging to other entities believed to be controlled by Bankman-Fried, including Alameda Research, the supposedly separate crypto trading operation. The investment manager told NBC News he shared some of the former employee's statements with members of the Senate banking committee.FTX's bankruptcy filings, public statements by Bankman-Fried and news reports raise questions about possible commingling of customers' money and transfers of funds between FTX and Alameda.""Silvergate appears to be at the center of the improper transfer of billions in FTX customer funds. Americans need answers. Those guilty of wrongdoing must be held accountable,"" Sen. Warren said in a statement.In response to the lawmakers' letter, Silvergate provided this statement: ""We received Senator Warren's letter and look forward to answering her questions openly and transparently. Like many others, Silvergate was the victim of FTX's and Alameda Research's apparent misuse of customer assets and other lapses of judgment and we believe our full cooperation will help set the record straight about our role in the digital asset ecosystem.""Citing client confidentiality and Silvergate's status as a federally regulated financial institution, Lane declined to answer NBC News' questions about the bank's dealings with FTX, Alameda or other Bankman-Fried companies.Late Monday, Lane put out a new statement describing the bank's extensive due diligence process on FTX and Alameda, saying: ""If we detect activity that is unexpected or potentially concerning in any account, we conduct an investigation and, when required, confidentially file a suspicious activity report in accordance with federal regulation."" Silvergate's customers are all institutional and include crypto exchanges, hedge funds, venture capital firms and other institutions that buy and sell digital currencies, its website and securities filings show. Silvergate has over 1,300 digital currency and fintech customers using its platform daily, it says. In 2017, it launched an instant money transfer system that operates 24/7, called the Silvergate Exchange Network, or SEN. Over that time, SEN has facilitated $1 trillion in transfers of U.S. dollars, the bank states.In a recent news release addressing the FTX mess, Lane said his institution's exposure to the FTX debacle is nominal, with FTX deposits totaling less than 10% of the bank's almost $12 billion in digital deposits as of Sept. 30. ""As a federally regulated banking institution that is well capitalized, we maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity to support our customers' needs,"" Lane said.Still, Silvergate's potential exposure to the FTX crackup extends beyond the deposits it held for the company. Silvergate's securities filings spell out the potential risks posed by associations with problematic clients. ""If one of our customers (or in the case of digital currency exchanges, their customers) were to engage in or be accused of engaging in illegal activities using digital currency,"" a filing states, ""we could be subject to various fines and sanctions, including limitations on our activities, which could also cause reputational damage and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.""Silvergate is overseen by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the state of California and its deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. fund, its securities filings show. As a regulated bank, Silvergate has a duty to monitor clients' accounts for suspicious activities that could signal fraud, money laundering or tax evasion, the filings note. Such crimes can be enabled through the use of digital currencies, the bank acknowledged in its filings, but Silvergate said its risk management and compliance framework ""is reasonably designed to detect any such illicit activities conducted by our potential or existing customer."" Still, the bank conceded in those filings that it could not ensure its ability to uncover all such activities were they to occur.Silvergate's use of Bankman-Fried as a pitchman may also create potential legal risks, one securities law expert said. ""If they're advertising him on their website, they would have a more substantial duty of due diligence,"" said Lewis D. Lowenfels, a prominent securities lawyer and co-author of the leading treatise on the nation's securities laws. ""They have a duty to make sure they are not stimulating a fraud.""Crypto-driven depositsFifteen years ago, well before the crypto craze, Silvergate Bank was a small industrial loan company in San Diego with four branches, 40 employees and $300 million in assets, Lane has said in interviews. The bank dodged the mortgage meltdown of 2008, and with other lenders in disarray had no trouble attracting borrowers. Amassing deposits was harder, though, and as it battled larger and more established institutions for its share, in 2013, Lane said, he began to see the promise of crypto.Buying and trading bitcoin was taking off, but other banks were avoiding the cryptocurrency business because risks of money laundering and other financial crimes had plagued the arena, Lane has acknowledged. In a 2019 podcast, he agreed when asked if Silvergate aimed to fill the crypto banking vacuum and ""drive deposits.""Drive them he did. Silvergate's deposits had grown to $13 billion in the September quarter, and its stock, issued to the public in 2019 at $12, soared to $217 in early November 2021 when the price of bitcoin hit a peak of almost $69,000. Then, Lane's Silvergate holdings were worth an estimated $87.5 million based on data in regulatory filings. Now, with Silvergate's stock down 89%, Lane's stake, smaller as a result of some stock sales, has a value of $6.1 million.Almost 40% of Silvergate's deposits are from foreign entities, its filings state, without specifying the countries. This isn't surprising in the crypto arena. Only 2% of FTX exchange customers were U.S.-based, a recent filing in the bankruptcy court shows. Fully one-third of FTX's customers were from the Cayman Islands and the Virgin Islands, known tax havens, while customers from China, which has outlawed crypto transactions, totaled 8% of FTX customers.A regulated institution, Silvergate must monitor its clients' accounts for illegal activities, such as money laundering or tax evasion, and alert regulators to suspicious transactions. ""Once the bank has established a customer relationship, it should be alert for unusual transactions,"" states a manual published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the nation's top bank regulators. Among the activities banks should watch for, the manual says, is an ""unusual transfer of funds among related accounts, or accounts that involve the same or related principals.""Banks are supposed to file what are known as suspicious activity reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) when they spot problematic transactions. But such filings are confidential and it could not be determined whether Silvergate had filed any of these reports regarding FTX. The lawmakers' letter specifically asks if Silvergate filed suspicious activity reports about FTX, adding that a failure to do so may constitute a violation of the law.FTX frequently used the Silvergate Exchange Network, according to the former FTX employee with direct knowledge of the transactions. Among the transactions described by the former employee were transfers of funds from FTX's client account at Silvergate to accounts belonging to Alameda Research and other entities the employee believed were controlled by Bankman-Fried.Bank compliance experts say large institutional clients like those that bank at Silvergate require intense due diligence because they are so complex and ownership can be obscure. For example, one expert said that multiple analysts would have been required to service just one large account like FTX's to ensure against money laundering.As the crypto craze has gone cold and several crypto currency exchanges have filed for bankruptcy, Lane has issued statements assuring investors that none of those failures will hurt its operations.The bank also made a recent change in its internal risk oversight. On Nov. 7, a few days before FTX filed for bankruptcy, Silvergate named a new chief risk officer: Kathleen Fraher, previously the bank's vice president, compliance and Bank Secrecy Act officer. Fraher replaced Tyler Pearson, a son-in-law of Silvergate CEO Lane who had been in that role. Pearson is now deputy chief risk officer at the bank. A Silvergate spokeswoman said the change reflected a shift in functions taken on by a new president at the bank."
2022-12-06,"A year after Nishad Singh became FTX's director of engineering, he quietly emerged as a reliable political donor for the Democrats.Singh donated $8 million to federal campaigns in the 2022 election cycle, and all of it went to Democrats, according to the nonpartisan campaign watchdog OpenSecrets.He was one of a handful of FTX executives, including former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who made massive contributions in the 2022 midterm elections before the company's collapse. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried wasn't the only company executive who put big money behind campaigns aligned with the Democratic Party.A year after Nishad Singh became the company's director of engineering, he quietly emerged as a reliable political donor for Democrats, according to over a dozen Federal Election Commission records reviewed by CNBC.Singh, who became FTX's lead engineer in 2019 following a stint at Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research, has donated more than $13 million to party causes since the start of the 2020 presidential election, according to state and federal campaign finance records.Singh donated $8 million to federal campaigns in the 2022 election cycle, and all of it went to Democrats, according to the nonpartisan campaign watchdog OpenSecrets. He was among a handful of former senior officials at FTX who were deeply involved with financing the 2022 midterms.The sum makes him the 34th highest donor to all federal campaigns across the country during the latest election, ahead of other party donors such as billionaires Tom Steyer and angel investor Ron Conway, OpenSecrets said.Singh's only recorded campaign donation before he took the senior role at FTX was a $2,700 contribution in 2018 to Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., a member of the House Financial Services Committee.Two years later, Singh donated $1 million to Future Forward USA, a PAC that backed President Joe Biden's 2020 run for president, records show. Singh lists Alameda Research as his employer on the filing showing the $1 million donation.Records show some of his donations mirrored those made by Bankman-Fried. The former FTX CEO gave $5 million to the pro-Biden PAC the same month Singh contributed.Singh, who was among the FTX leaders initially fired after the company collapsed, did not return repeated requests for comment. He reportedly was one of Bankman-Fried's roommates and contributed to FTX's philanthropic arm. Singh's multimillion-dollar output in the midterms makes him only one of the key FTX figures who piled money into the election cycle.Bankman-Fried contributed $39 million during the 2022 midterms, while co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets Ryan Salame donated another $23 million, according to OpenSecrets. Bankman-Fried gave most of his money to Democrats, while Salame aimed to boost Republicans.Still, Singh was known in the crypto political fundraising world as a ""Bankman-Fried guy,"" who made many of the same campaign contributions as the former FTX CEO, according to a strategist for multiple crypto-backed political action committees. Those who declined to be named in this story did so in order to speak about private conversations.Bankman-Fried and FTX are under investigation by federal authorities and regulators after it was discovered that the cryptocurrency company funneled billions of dollars in FTX client funds into Alameda Research. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month.Bankruptcy court filings show that Alameda made $4.1 billion in related party loans, including a $543 million loan to Singh.The former lead engineer at FTX spread his money across a variety of Democratic causes before the company's collapse.Singh gave a combined $2 million in June and July to the Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC that helped Democrats maintain their majority in the U.S. Senate. That's double the amount Bankman-Fried contributed to the same organization throughout the midterms. That super PAC is currently spending millions to help Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., defeat Republican candidate Herschel Walker in a runoff campaign for a Senate seat in Georgia.A PAC spokeswoman declined to comment.Singh lists a mailing address in Los Altos Hills, California, on the FEC filings showing the contributions to the super PAC. The home was sold last year for more than $4 million and features a wraparound deck next to an outdoor hot tub, according to Zillow.Singh gave $4 million, combined, in August and September to Reproductive Freedom for All, a campaign that boosted a Michigan ballot measure called Proposition 3, according to state records. The ballot measure approved last month effectively codifies abortion rights for people in Michigan.The $4 million Singh gave to the group doubles billionaire Mike Bloomberg's $2 million contribution to the same organization in September, records show. A representative for the campaign did not return requests for comment.Singh gave another $1 million last year to Mind the Gap, a super PAC that was co-founded by Barbara Fried, a lawyer and Sam Bankman-Fried's mother. The super PAC has reportedly acted as a donor advisory group that helps Democrats raise campaign cash. Singh's donation was the single largest contribution the PAC has ever received, according to OpenSecrets.The FEC filing showing the $1 million to Mind the Gap lists Singh's mailing address as an over 7,000-square-foot-home in Saratoga, California. The home is estimated to be worth $8.5 million, according to Zillow.Fried did not return a request for comment. Representatives for the PAC also did not return requests for comment. The political donations came in the buildup to FTX's collapse. Washington has increased its scrutiny of FTX, and the House Financial Services Committee is preparing to hold a hearing later this month on the platform's implosion.The committee has called on Bankman-Fried to testify. The former FTX CEO said in a tweet Sunday that he may not testify in front of the committee during the Dec. 13 hearing, citing his need to finish ""learning and reviewing what happened"" at his crypto company.Committee Chair Rep. Maxine Water, D-Calif., insisted to Bankman-Fried in a tweet Monday that ""it is imperative that you attend our hearing on the 13th."" A lawmaker on the committee told CNBC that, as of Monday evening, Waters had yet to tell members privately that she will subpoena Bankman-Fried to testify.John Jay Ray III, the current FTX CEO, is going to testify on Dec. 13, according to House Financial Services Committee ranking member Rep.

2022-12-06,"Jack Dorsey's digital payments firm Block and Alyse Killeen's bitcoin-focused venture firm Stillmark, have led a $2 million seed investment into Gridless.Gridless designs, builds and operates bitcoin mining sites alongside small-scale renewable energy producers in rural Africa where excess energy is not utilized.  ACCRA, GHANA — Up until February, Janet Maingi didn't think much about bitcoin. Born and raised in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, Maingi had instead spent more than twenty years focused on trying to solve one of Africa's biggest problems: connectivity. To that end, she spent more than 20 years working in operations in the telecom industry, in companies specializing in internet and wireless networks to cable and satellite television. But earlier this year, the 45-year-old mother decided to take on the continent's second-biggest issue: Its energy problem.Africa is a renewable energy mecca. There's an estimated 10 terawatts of solar capacity, 350 gigawatts of hydro, and another 110 gigawatts of wind, according to data from Energy, Capital & Power, an investment platform focused on Africa's energy sector. Some of this renewable energy is being harnessed already, but a lot of it isn't, because it is expensive to build the kind of specialized infrastructure necessary to capture it. Even though Africa boasts 60% of the best solar resources globally, the continent only has 1% installed solar PV capacity, according to the International Energy Agency.""When you sit back and look at rural Africa and rural Kenya, one of the things that is very prevalent in the homes — I am talking about the 50% that are not electrified — is children have to do their assignments using either paraffin lamps or candles,"" Maingi told CNBC on the sidelines of the Africa Bitcoin Conference in Accra.""Think of their eyesight, think of their health,"" she said. Maingi was frustrated by the divide between generation and capacity, given that 43% of Africa's population, or 600 million people, lack access to electricity. So in February, she began spitballing creative solutions with two friends, and the three of them landed on a sort-of counterintuitive idea: bitcoin mining.Mining for the world's biggest cryptocurrency is a process known as proof-of-work. Miners around the world run high-powered computers that collectively validate transactions and simultaneously create new tokens. The process requires a lot of electricity, and because this is the only variable cost in a low-margin industry, miners tend to seek out the world's lowest-cost sources of power. Bitcoin gets a bad rap for the amount of energy it consumes, but it can also help to unlock these trapped renewable sources of energy. Bitcoin miners are essentially energy buyers, and when they co-locate with renewables, it creates a financial incentive for buildout and improves the core economics of renewable power production. The IEA says that in rural areas ""where over 80% of the electricity-deprived live, mini-grids and stand-alone systems, mostly solar based, are the most viable solutions."" By May, Maingi and her two colleagues decided to try it out. They founded a venture called Gridless to see whether the additional demand of bitcoin miners on these semi-stranded assets could make renewables in Africa economically viable — and crucially, whether the additional source of energy could power communities previously out of reach of microgrids that electrify parts of Africa.  Gridless also has plans to expand into other parts of Africa with the help of a fresh injection of cash.Jack Dorsey's digital payments firm Block and Alyse Killeen's bitcoin-focused venture firm Stillmark, have led a $2 million seed investment into the company, which Gridless says it plans to use to open new mines.Maingi is the chief operations officer, and her two friends turned co-founders, chief executive Erik Hersman, and chief financial officer Philip Walton, have spent the last several months launching pilots across Kenya in which they work with mini-grid hydro and solar generators to use their excess capacity to mine.""We had spent years building internet connectivity infrastructure in rural and urban Africa, and realized that you cannot have a 21st-century economy without both power and connectivity together,"" Hersman told CNBC. ""As we looked at the next problem to solve, we realized that bitcoin mining solved a major problem for renewable mini grid energy developers, in that we could be their industrial off-taker for stranded power, no matter where they were located, thereby making them more sustainable and increasing electrification across Africa,"" continued Hersman.Gridless currently has three operational pilot sites in Murang'a, a rural town that's a 90-minute drive northeast of Nairobi. Each mine runs on hydroelectric power from HydroBox, an energy company based on the continent. Two of the mines have about 50 kilowatts of capacity, and by Thursday, the third mine will expand to 300 kilowatts.To put those numbers into perspective, 30 kilowatts would power about 500 households. 50 kilowatts is closer to 800 households.In January, Gridless plans to launch another 50-kilowatt hydromine in Malawi and its first solar-powered site in West Africa that will have a 30 kilowatt capacity. So far, the economics make a lot of sense for everyone involved. Gridless serves as a sort of anchor tenant. The company finances construction and manages the operation of data centers in rural communities where traditional industrial or commercial customers are not available, according to a company statement released Tuesday. Because the power supplier benefits from selling energy that previously had been discarded, the energy plants will sometimes lower costs for the end user. At one of their pilot sites in Kenya, for example, the hydro plant dropped the price of power from 35 cents per kilowatt hour to 25 cents.The buildout of capacity is also electrifying households. Gridless says they've already seen this translate to containerized cold storage for local farmers, battery charging stations for electric motorcycles and public WiFi points.Once those types of needs are met, Gridless said in a statement that the remaining electricity capacity is used to power the bitcoin mine.""Bitcoin and mining is really the tool. We're not doing bitcoin for bitcoin,"" said the lead for bitcoin mining and wallet at Block, Thomas Templeton. ""The whole objective is really to empower these villages. Bitcoin is a means to that end.""Block previously announced in April it would be teaming up with Blockstream to break ground on a solar- and battery-powered bitcoin mine in Texas that uses solar and storage technology from Tesla.Block is also working on a project to make bitcoin mining more distributed and efficient.Making the mining process more accessible has to do with more than just creating new bitcoin, according to Templeton. Instead, he says the company sees it as a long-term need for a future that is fully decentralized and permissionless.The company is solving one major barrier to entry: Mining rigs are hard to find, expensive and delivery can be unpredictable. Block says it is looking into making a new ASIC, which is the specialized gear used to mine bitcoin. Democratizing access to the mining process is big for Block. Right now, Africa accounts for around 0.2% of the global bitcoin hashrate (an industry term used to describe the collective computing power of the entire network), according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. The bulk sum of the hashpower shifted from China to the U.S. over the last 18 months after Beijing banned crypto mining. Many in the industry tell CNBC that this kind of centralization is a problem.""Decentralized mining is essential for the resiliency of bitcoin,"" said Templeton, who added that Block kicked off its mining initiative to make mining more accessible, user-friendly and reliable, so that more people can mine.It was a sentiment echoed by Dorsey in Accra on Tuesday morning. The Block CEO, who said he still plans to move to Africa for six months, added that Block wants to partner with other companies on the continent to make it easier to onboard people into bitcoin.""We're working on a hardware miner to make it more, hopefully, accessible and more efficient for people around the world and especially on the continent to participate in securing the network and making it even more resilient in the form of something that's also useful for other things, not just mining.""Supporting the rise of bitcoin mining across Africa also translates to another big goal for Block: Helping to accelerate global renewable hashrate.""Gridless represents a close strategic alignment with our vision of ensuring the bitcoin network increasingly leverages clean energy, in combination with bitcoin computational centers around the world,"" said Templeton."
2022-12-08,"The SEC is advising companies to disclose their involvement with digital commodities firms, according to guidance released Thursday.The guidance comes a day after SEC Chair Gary Gensler defended the agency from claims that it failed to prevent crypto firms from misusing customer funds.Companies are advised to describe any risks or material exposures related to crypto assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission released new guidance Thursday, requiring companies that issue securities to disclose to investors their exposure and risk to the cryptocurrency market.The guidance comes about a month after FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, filed for bankruptcy after loan customer funds to a risky trading company that was founded by FTX's former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Over 100,000 customers were affected by the exchange's failure.On Wednesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler fended off accusations that the agency has failed to prevent crypto firms from misusing customer funds. Gensler also said the SEC would take more enforcement actions if the firms fail to comply with existing rules. Under the new guidance, companies will have to include crypto asset holdings as well as their risk exposure to the FTX bankruptcy and other market developments in their public filings. The company's bankruptcy filings indicate the company has over 1 million creditors.The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance developed a sample letter after a selective review of findings made under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which directs companies to disclose ""such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,"" according to the guidance.A suggested item within the letter asks the issuer to describe how company bankruptcies and subsequent effects ""have impacted or may impact your business, financial condition, customers, and counterparties, either directly or indirectly."" Another asks for a description of ""any material risk to you, either direct or indirect, due to excessive redemptions, withdrawals, or a suspension of redemptions or withdrawals, of crypto assets. Identify any material concentrations of risk and quantify any material exposures.""The SEC's corporate finance division encouraged companies to adopt these recommendations as they prepare documents ""that may not typically be subject to review by the Division before their use."""

2022-12-09,"Before founding Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek was involved in multiple ventures that ended in collapse, including one where suppliers claimed they were unable to access their earnings.Over a decade ago, Marszalek and his business partner were paid millions of dollars by  their manufacturing company, months before it entered bankruptcy.In a tweet thread published ahead of this story, Marszalek wrote “startups are hard,” and “you will fail over and over again.”  Kris Marszalek wants everyone to know that his company, Crypto.com, is safe and in good hands. His TV appearances and tweets make that clear.It's an understandable approach. The crypto markets have been in freefall for much of the year, with high-profile names spiraling into bankruptcy. When FTX failed last month just after founder Sam Bankman-Fried said the crypto exchange's assets were fine, trust across the industry evaporated.Marszalek, who has operated out of Asia for over a decade, subsequently assured clients that their funds belong to them and are readily available, in contrast to FTX, which used client money for all sorts of risky and allegedly fraudulent activities, according to court filings and legal experts. Bankman-Fried has denied knowing about any fraud. Regardless, FTX clients are now out billions of dollars with bankruptcy proceedings underway.Crypto.com, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, may well be in fine health. After the FTX collapse, the company published its unaudited, partial proof of reserves. The release revealed that nearly 20% of customer funds were in a meme token called shiba inu, an amount eclipsed only by its bitcoin allocation. That percentage has dropped since the initial release to about 15%, according to Nansen Analytics. Marszalek said in a Nov. 14 livestream on YouTube that the wallet addresses were representative of customer holdings. On Friday, Crypto.com published an audited proof of reserves, attesting that customer assets were held on a one-to-one basis, meaning that all deposits are 100% backed by Crypto.com's reserves.  The audit was performed by the Mazars Group, the former accountant for the Trump Organization.While no evidence has emerged of wrongdoing at Crypto.com, Marszalek's business history is replete with red flags. Following the collapse of a prior company in 2009, a judge called Marszalek's testimony unreliable. His business activities before 2016 — the year he founded what would become Crypto.com — involved a multimillion-dollar settlement over claims of defective products, corporate bankruptcy and an e-commerce company that failed shortly after a blowout marketing campaign left sellers unable to access their money. Court records, public filings and offshore database leaks reveal a businessman who moved from industry to industry, rebooting quickly when a venture would fail. He started in manufacturing, producing data storage products for white label sale, then moved into e-commerce, and finally into crypto.CNBC reached out to Crypto.com with information on Marszalek's past and asked for an interview. The company declined to make Marszalek available and sent a statement indicating that there was ""never a finding of wrongdoing under Kris's leadership"" at his prior ventures. After CNBC's requests, Marszalek published a 16-tweet thread, beginning by telling his followers: ""More FUD targeting Crypto.com is coming, this time about a business failure I had very early in my career. I have nothing to hide, and am proud of my battle scars, so here's the unfiltered story."" FUD is short for fear, uncertainty and doubt and is a popular phrase among crypto executives.In the tweets, Marszalek described his past personal bankruptcy and the abrupt closure of his e-commerce business as learning experiences, and added that ""startups are hard,"" and ""you will fail over and over again.""  Marszalek founded a manufacturing firm called Starline in 2004, according to his LinkedIn profile. Based in Hong Kong, with a plant in mainland China, Starline built hardware products like solid state drives, hard drives, and USB flash drives. Marzsalek's LinkedIn page says he grew the business into a 400-person company with $81 million in sales in three years.There was much more to the story.Marszalek owned 50% of the company, sharing ownership and control with another Hong-Kong based individual, who partnered with Marszalek in multiple ventures. In 2009, Marzsalek's company settled with a client over a faulty shipment of flash drives. The $5 million settlement consisted of a $1 million upfront payment and a $4 million credit note to the client, Dexxon. The negotiations over the settlement began at some point after 2007.CNBC was unable to locate Marszalek's business partner. Court documents don't show whether Starline made good on either the $1 million ""lump sum settlement fee"" or the $4 million credit note. Starline was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by the end of 2009, court records from 2013 show.Over the course of 2008 and 2009, Marszalek and his partner were transferred nearly $3 million in payments from Starline, according to the documents.Over $1 million was paid out to Marszalek personally in what the court said were ""impugned payments."" His partner took home nearly $1.9 million in similar payments.""It appears that there was a concerted effort to strip the cash from Starline,"" Judge Anthony Chan later wrote in a court filing. Some $300,000 was paid by Starline to a British Virgin Islands holding company called Tekram, the document says. That money went through Marszalek, and Tekram eventually returned it to Starline.By 2009, Starline had collapsed. Marszalek's representatives told CNBC in a statement that Starline went under because customers failed to pay back credit lines that the company had extended them during the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. Starline borrowed that money from Standard Chartered Bank of Hong Kong (SCB).""The bank then turned to Starline and the co-founders to repay the lines of credit and filed for liquidation of the company,"" the statement said.Starline owed $2.2 million to SCB. Marszalek said on Twitter that he had personally guaranteed the loans from the bank to Starline. As a result, when the bank forced Starline into liquidation, Marszalek and his partner were forced into bankruptcy as well.The court found that the $300,000 transfer to Tekram was ""in truth a payment"" to Marszalek.Marszalek said the money in the Tekram transfer was repayment of a debt Starline owed to Tekram. The judge described that claim as ""inherently incredible.""""There is no explanation why the repayment had to be channelled through him or why the money was later returned to the debtor,"" the judge said.  Bankruptcy didn't sever the ties between Marszalek and his partner or keep them out of business for long. At the same time Starline was shutting down, the pair set up an offshore holding company called Middle Kingdom Capital. Middle Kingdom was established in the Cayman Islands, a notorious hub for tax shelters. The connection between Middle Kingdom and Marszalek and his partner, who each held half of the firm, was exposed in the 2017 Paradise Papers leak. The Paradise Papers, along with the Panama Papers, contained documents about a web of offshore holdings in tax havens. They were published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Middle Kingdom was the owner of Buy Together, which in turn owned BeeCrazy, an e-commerce venture that Marszalek had started pursuing. Similar to Groupon, retailers could use BeeCrazy to sell their products at steep discounts. BeeCrazy would process payments, take a commission on goods sold, and distribute funds to the retailers.

Buy Together drew attention from an Australian conglomerate called iBuy, which was on the verge of an IPO and pursued an acquisition of BeeCrazy as part of a plan to build out an Asian e-commerce empire.Court filings and Australian disclosures show that to seal the deal, Marszalek and his partner had to remain employed by iBuy for three years and clear their individual bankruptcies in Hong Kong court. The partner's uncle came forward in front of the court to help his nephew and Marszalek clear their names and debts, filings show.While the judge called the uncle's involvement ""suspicious,"" he allowed him to repay the debt. As a result, both Marszalek and his partner's bankruptcies were annulled. A few months later, in October 2013, BeeCrazy was purchased by iBuy for $21 million in cash and stock, according to S&P Capital IQ. A month and a half after buying BeeCrazy, iBuy went public. Marszalek was required to remain until 2016. The company struggled after its IPO as competition picked up from bigger players like Alibaba. Marszalek was eventually promoted to CEO of iBuy in August 2014, according to filings with Australian regulators.  Marszalek renamed iBuy as Ensogo in an effort to retool the company. Ensogo continued to suffer, running up a loss in 2015 equal to over $50 million.By the following year, Ensogo had already reportedly laid off half its staff. In June 2016, Ensogo closed down operations. The same day, Marszalek resigned.After the sudden shuttering of Ensogo, sellers on the site told the South China Morning Press that they never received proceeds from items they'd already delivered as part of a final blowout sale. ""[Many] sellers had already sold their goods but had yet to receive any money from the platform at that time, their money thus vanished altogether with the online shopping platform,"" according to translated testimony from a representative for a group of sellers before Hong Kong's Legislative Council.One seller told Hong Kong's The Standard that she lost more than $25,000 in the process. ""It seems to us that they wanted to make huge business from us one last time before they closed down,"" the seller told the publication.Marszalek's representative acknowledged to CNBC that ""the shutdown angered many customers and consumers"" and said that was ""one of the reasons Kris was opposed to the decision.""  Marszalek moved quickly on to his next thing. The same month he resigned from Ensogo, Foris Limited was incorporated, marking Marszalek's entry into the crypto market.Foris' first foray into crypto was with Monaco, an early exchange. With a leadership team composed entirely of former Ensogo employees, Monaco told prospective investors they could expect three million customers and $169 million in revenue within five years. Monaco rebranded as Crypto.com in 2018. By 2021, the company had smashed its own goals, crossing the 10 million user mark. Revenue for the year topped $1.2 billion, according to the Financial Times. That's when crypto was soaring, with bitcoin climbing from about $7,300 at the beginning of 2020 to a peak of over $68,000 in November of 2021.  The company inked a deal with LeBron James for a Super Bowl ad, aired a prior commercial with Matt Damon and spent a reported $700 million to put its name on the arena that's home to the Los Angeles Lakers. It's also a sponsor of the World Cup in Qatar.The market's plunge in 2022 has been disastrous for all the major players and goes well beyond the FTX collapse and the numerous hedge funds and lenders that have liquidated. Coinbase's stock price is down 84%, and the company laid off 18% of its staff. Kraken recently cut 30% of its workforce. Crypto.com has laid off hundreds of employees in recent months, according to multiple reports. Questions percolated about the company in November after revelations that the prior month Crypto.com had sent more than 80% of its ether holdings, or about $400 million worth of the cryptocurrency, to Gate.io, another crypto exchange. The company only admitted the mistake after the transaction was exposed thanks to public blockchain data. Crypto.com said the funds were recovered.Marszalek went on CNBC on Nov. 15, following the FTX failure, to try and reassure customers and the public that the company has plenty of money, that it doesn't use leverage and that withdrawal demands had normalized after spiking.Still, the market cap for Cronos, Crypto.com's native token, has shrunk from over $3 billion on Nov. 8 to a little over $1.6 billion today, reflecting a loss of confidence among a key group of investors. During the crypto mania at this time last year, Cronos was worth over $22 billion.Cronos has stabilized of late, hovering around six cents for the last three weeks. Bitcoin prices have been flat for about four weeks. Marszalek's narrative is that he's learned from past mistakes and that ""early failures made me who I am today,"" he wrote in his tweet thread. He's asking customers to believe him.""I'm proud of my scar tissue and the way I persevered in the face of adversity,"" he tweeted. ""Failure taught me humility, how to not overextend, and how to plan for the worst.""Correction: Crypto.com's Super Bowl ad featured LeBron James, not Matt Damon. The commercial with Damon came out in late 2021.Clarification: This story has been updated to more accurately reflect where in Asia Marszalek has operated.WATCH: Sam Bankman-Fried faces an onslaught of regulatory probes"
2022-12-09,"Crypto executive Sam Bankman-Fried agreed to testify before the House Financial Services committee, after CNBC reported that Representative Maxine Waters would not be pursuing a subpoena.Bankman-Fried also sparred with Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, telling him that he'd ""won.""FTX's implosion left millions of creditors without their funds, and ranks as one of the largest corporate bankruptcies of all time. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to testify before the House Financial Services Committee at a hearing about the crypto exchange's collapse on Tuesday, he said in a series of tweets Friday morning.There's been a lot of back and forth in Washington over whether lawmakers would have to subpoena Bankman-Fried, who said he would voluntarily testify since the committee ""still thinks it would be useful."" It was unclear whether he would show up on Capitol Hill in person or stay in the Bahamas where he's been holed up for much of the time since his company filed for bankruptcy last month, holding interviews with reporters.In his tweet thread, the disgraced former ""darling"" of crypto appeared to lay blame on Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.The ex-CEO of FTX has been on a media blitz the last month talking about the implosion of his crypto empire, but this will be the first time the public has the chance to hear from SBF under oath. Bankman-Fried wrote that he still did not have access to much of his data, professional or personal, so there was a ""limit"" to what he would be able to say.""I won't be as helpful as I'd like. But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th,"" continued the post.Bankman-Fried used his tweet thread to antagonize Binance boss Zhao, claiming that he had ""won,"" and that the restrictions that Zhao wanted to impose as part of Binance's aborted bailout were excessively onerous.Bankman-Fried didn't think there were any winners, he said in a tweet.""Seeing how CZ talks, I'm pretty sure he does,"" Bankman-Fried continued.""Sam was so unhinged when we decided to pull out as an investor that he launched a series of offensive tirades at multiple Binance team members,"" Zhao wrote in a Twitter thread.In the days leading up to FTX's collapse, Zhao was heralded as a potential savior for the exchange. FTX was once considered to be the most stable and reliable crypto exchange in the industry, but an article from CoinDesk revealed an alarming concentration of self-issued FTT tokens being used as collateral for billions in loans for Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's crypto hedge fund. The article, paired with Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison's tweet activity, sent FTX into a liquidity crisis.Bankman-Fried was responding to a series of tweets posted by Zhao about why Binance walked out on the potential acquisition offer. When Binance stepped away, FTX fell into freefall, ultimately filing for bankruptcy protection shortly after.Zhao torched Bankman-Fried for rampant spending on vanity projects from marketing to ""mansions."" He was responding to a Thursday morning appearance by CNBC contributor Kevin O'Leary on ""Squawk Box.""O'Leary had said that he lost his entire $15 million payday and was embarrassed at his lack of due diligence.Bankman-Fried has played coy with lawmakers, despite a threat to subpoena him from the Senate Finance Committee this week and repeated demands from House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif., to testify under oath at that panel's hearing.Investors and regulators have been seeking answers from Bankman-Fried for some time now. Despite several highly publicized media and Twitter spaces appearances, the former billionaire has revealed little about the chaotic final days at FTX.A growing number of investors and pundits believe that the only place Bankman-Fried should be is in prison. Legal experts CNBC spoke with say that his sentence could hypothetically run for his entire life, if convicted.Before Bankman-Fried agreed to testify, CNBC reported that Waters was not planning to subpoena the ex-billionaire. Waters pushed back, claiming a subpoena was ""absolutely"" on the table."
2022-12-09,"The Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal by the major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.Coinbase is seeking to have two customer lawsuits against the company resolved by private arbitration, not by a federal court.A federal appeals court has refused to stay both cases at the district court level while the crypto firm seeks to reverse orders denying it the right to arbitrate the disputes.One suit involves a Dogecoin sweepstakes contest. The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal by the major crypto exchange Coinbase, which is seeking to have two customer lawsuits against the company resolved by private arbitration, not by a federal court.""We are gratified the Supreme Court agreed to hear our appeal, and we look forward to its resolution of this matter,"" a Coinbase spokesperson said.The issue the high court will take up in Coinbase's case relates to the highly technical question of whether a party in a lawsuit can be forced to continue to defend the case in proceedings in a federal district court, even as it asks an appeals court to send the dispute to an arbitrator.But the case might be the first taken by the Supreme Court involving a cryptocurrency company.""It's the first one I've known of, for sure,"" said Glenn Chappell, an attorney for Abraham Bielski, one of the Coinbase customers who is suing the company.""It may very well be the first one,"" he said. He and Bielski's other lawyers had opposed Coinbase's request to have the Supreme Court take the case.""We don't think that companies like Coinbase should be entitled to an automatic stay of litigation after a district court has already determined their arbitration is unlawful,"" Chappell said.But, he added, ""We definitely still welcome the ability to advocate on behalf of consumers in the matter.""Bielski sued Coinbase after he was scammed out of more than $31,000 from his account at the company by someone not connected to Coinbase. His would-be class action lawsuit alleges that the Electronic Funds Transfer Act requires Coinbase to credit customer accounts for stolen cryptocurrency.

But a California federal district court judge ruled that the arbitration agreement Bielski had with the company was not valid under that state's law, which allowed his case to proceed in district court.In the other lawsuit taken up by the high court on Friday, Coinbase customers sued the company in California district court claiming that Coinbase's promotion of a Dogecoin sweepstakes in June 2021 violate state law.As in Bielski's case, a district judge refused Coinbase's request to send the sweepstakes-related case to arbitration.The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in both cases denied Coinbase's request to put the lawsuits on hold at the district court level as the company pursued appeals seeking to overturn the rulings denying it arbitration.Neal Katyal, an attorney representing Coinbase at the Supreme Court, in his petition asking the justices to hear the company's appeal said that there is a deep split among lower federal appeals courts on the question the court will decide.Six federal appeals circuits have held that an appeal of a denial of a motion to compel arbitration ""automatically"" stays proceeding in a district court, Katyal wrote.But, ""Three circuits ... have held the opposite,"" he added. ""The circuits will remain divided unless this Court intervenes.""""Coinbase must now devote significant time, energy, and resources to burdensome putative class actions in two District Courts even though the Ninth Circuit is likely to conclude that neither case belongs in federal court to begin with,"" Katyal wrote."
2022-12-12,"FTX CEO John J. Ray III plans to tell the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday that the cryptocurrency exchange under Sam Bankman-Fried had ""unacceptable management practices.""Ray said in his remarks that FTX went on a ""spending binge"" from late 2021 through 2022 when approximately ""$5 billion was spent buying a myriad of businesses and investments, many of which may be worth only a fraction of what was paid for them.""He also said ""loans and other payments were made to insiders in excess of $1 billion."" FTX CEO John J. Ray III plans to tell the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday that the cryptocurrency exchange under Sam Bankman-Fried went on a $5 billion ""spending binge"" and comingled assets with those of his hedge fund, Alameda Research, according to the executive's prepared remarks.Ray lists those items among five things that he and his team have discovered since replacing Bankman-Fried last month, when the company filed for bankruptcy. The crypto trading firm imploded in spectacular fashion following a run on assets similar to a bank run.Ray said in his remarks that while ""many things are unknown at this stage,"" the new team knows the following:Customer assets from FTX were commingled with assets from Alameda.Alameda used client funds to do margin trading, exposing them to ""massive losses.""FTX went on a ""spending binge"" from late 2021 through 2022 when approximately ""$5 billion was spent buying a myriad of businesses and investments, many of which may be worth only a fraction of what was paid for them.""The firm made more than $1 billion in ""loans and other payments...to insiders.""Alameda's role as a market maker for crypto inspired it to place money into other exchanges that were ""inherently unsafe.""The remarks validate some details about the collapse that have been previously reported by media outlets, including CNBC, Bloomberg, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal.The committee made Ray's opening testimony public on Monday, a day before the hearing that will focus on FTX's collapse. Bankman-Fried said in a Monday interview on Twitter Spaces that he plans to testify at the upcoming House hearing via video from his location in the Bahamas.Although Ray only mentions Bankman-Fried by name twice in his seven page opening remarks, it's clear that many of his initial criticisms about the company are directed toward the organization's former leadership.Ray, in his statement, said, ""[N]ever in my career have I seen such an utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization, from the lack of financial statements to a complete failure of any internal controls or governance whatsoever,"" Ray says in his statement, echoing similar statements he made in the company's bankruptcy filing.Other issues at FTX, according to Ray's opening remarks:The use of computer infrastructure that gave individuals in senior management access to systems that stored customer assets, without security controls to prevent them from redirecting those assets.The storing of certain private keys to access hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto assets without effective security controls or encryption.The ability of Alameda, the crypto hedge fund within the FTX Group, to borrow funds held at FTX.com to be used for its own trading or investments without any effective limits.The absence of audited or reliable financial statements.The lack of personnel in financial and risk management functions, which are typically present in any company close to the size of FTX Group.The absence of independent governance throughout the FTX Group."
2022-12-12,"Following his arrest in the Bahamas on Monday, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faces the potential of a lengthy prison sentence.FTX collapsed last month following a liquidity crunch at the crypto exchange.""It is inconceivable to me that the Justice Department would have charged this case unless they were confident that they could extradite him,"" Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, told CNBC. Sam Bankman-Fried's arrest in the Bahamas on Monday marks the beginning of a new chapter in the FTX saga, one that will pit the former cryptocurrency billionaire against the Southern District of New York.CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin reported that the charges against Bankman-Fried include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.The indictment remained sealed until Tuesday morning. Neither the Attorney General of the Bahamas nor the Royal Bahamas Police Force would confirm the nature of the charges against Bankman-Fried.The SEC has initiated a separate set of charges against Bankman-Fried. The agency filed a civil complaint against him Tuesday, alleging that the ex-CEO of FTX engaged in a ""scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX."" The filing said Bankman-Fried raised more than $1.8 billion from investors and that ""unbeknownst to those investors ... Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform's customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire.""The charges could land Bankman-Fried in prison for decades, legal experts told CNBC. But before he ever serves time, U.S. prosecutors have to secure an extradition from the Bahamas back to New York. An effort to extradite""It is inconceivable to me that the Justice Department would have charged this case unless they were confident that they could extradite him,"" Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, told CNBC.Mariotti anticipates an extradition will take weeks to complete.""The statement by the Bahamian government suggests that they're going to cooperate,"" Mariotti said.

Because Bankman-Fried hasn't been convicted in the Bahamas yet, U.S. prosecutors had to secure an arrest warrant and provide sufficient evidence to the Bahamas that he had committed a crime.Extradition is the first step in a process that could take years. Given the magnitude of Bankman-Fried's alleged crimes, prosecutors and regulators will be pursuing concurrent cases around the world.A trial in the U.S. ""may not occur for years,"" Mariotti said.""The more that they charge, the bigger that the case is, the more time they're going to need to get in motion,"" he said. ""I would say late 2023 is the earliest a trial would occur.""Prosecutors could argue that FTX breached its fiduciary duty by allegedly using customer funds to artificially stabilize the price of the company's self-issued FTT coin, Mariotti said.Intent is also a factor in fraud cases, and Bankman-Fried insists he didn't know about potentially fraudulent activity. He told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook conference that he ""didn't knowingly commingle funds.""""I didn't ever try to commit fraud,"" Bankman-Fried said.In prepared testimony for the House Financial Services committee, new FTX CEO John Ray confirmed that commingling of funds had occurred between FTX and Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's hedge fund. Other legal troubleBeyond the criminal charges set to be unveiled Tuesday morning and the civil case brought by the SEC, Bankman-Fried is also facing possible civil actions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and state banking and securities regulators, said Richard Levin, who chairs the fintech and regulation practice at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough.The CFTC and lawmakers have begun their probes into FTX and Bankman-Fried, who told Sorkin he was down to his last $100,000.Lawmakers also expressed their satisfaction at Bankman-Fried's arrest. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who chairs the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, applauded both the Justice Department and Bahamian law enforcement ""for holding Sam Bankman-Fried accountable.""Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, echoed that sentiment but expressed disappointment that Bankman-Fried was arrested before his House testimony, which was scheduled for Tuesday.""I am surprised to hear that Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas at the direction of the United States Attorney,"" Waters said in a statement.""[The] American public deserves to hear directly from Mr. Bankman-Fried about the actions that've harmed over one million people,"" Waters said.Prior to his arrest, Bankman-Fried had also been invited to appear before the Senate at a hearing Wednesday.It's unclear whether the SEC or the CFTC will take the lead in securing civil damages.""The question of who would be taking the lead there, whether it be the SEC or CFTC, depends on whether or not there were securities involved,"" Mariotti told CNBC.SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who met with Bankman-Fried and FTX executives earlier this year, has said publicly that ""many crypto tokens are securities,"" which would make his agency the primary regulator.But many exchanges, including FTX, have crypto derivatives platforms that sell financial products such as futures and options, which fall under the CFTC's jurisdiction.""For selling unregistered securities without a registration or an exemption, you could be looking at the Securities Exchange Commission suing for disgorgement — monetary penalties,"" said Levin, who's represented clients before both agencies.Investors who have lost their savings aren't waiting. Class-action suits have already been filed against FTX endorsers, including comedian Larry David and football superstar Tom Brady. One suit excoriated the celebrities for allegedly failing to do their ""due diligence prior to marketing [FTX] to the public.""FTX's industry peers are also filing suit against Bankman-Fried. Failed lender BlockFi sued Bankman-Fried in November, seeking unnamed collateral that the FTX founder provided for the crypto lending firm.FTX and Bankman-Fried had previously rescued BlockFi from insolvency in June, but when FTX failed, BlockFi was left with a similar liquidity problem and filed for bankruptcy protection in New Jersey.Bankman-Fried has also been sued in Florida and California federal courts. He faces class-action suits in both states over what a California court filing called ""one of the great frauds in history.""The largest securities class-action settlement was for $7.2 billion in the Enron accounting fraud case, according to Stanford research. The possibility of a multibillion-dollar settlement would come on top of civil and criminal fines that Bankman-Fried faces. A life behind barsIf the DOJ were able to secure a conviction, a judge would look to several factors to determine how long to sentence him.Based on the size of the losses, if Bankman-Fried is convicted on any of the fraud charges, he could be behind bars for years — potentially for the rest of his life, said Braden Perry, a partner at Kennyhertz Perry who advises clients on anti-money laundering, compliance and enforcement issues.But the length of any potential sentence is hard to predict, said Perry, who was previously a senior trial lawyer for the CFTC, FTX's only official U.S. regulator.Federal sentencing guidelines follow a numeric system to determine the maximum and minimum allowable sentence, but the system can be esoteric. The scale, or ""offense level,"" starts at one, and maxes out at 43.A wire fraud conviction rates as a seven on the scale, with a minimum sentence ranging from zero to six months.But mitigating factors and enhancements can alter that rating, Perry told CNBC.""The dollar value of loss plays a significant role. Under the guidelines, any loss above $550 million adds 30 points to the base level offense,"" Perry said. FTX customers have lost billions of dollars.""Having 25 or more victims adds 6 points, [and] use of certain regulated markets adds 4,"" Perry said.That means Bankman-Fried could be facing life in federal prison, without the possibility of supervised release, if he's convicted on just one of the offenses that prosecutors will reportedly pursue.If convicted, his sentence could be reduced by mitigating factors.""In practice, many white-collar defendants are sentenced to lesser sentences than what the guidelines dictate,"" Perry said. Even in large fraud cases, that 30-point enhancement previously mentioned can be considered punitive.By way of comparison, Stefan Qin, the Australian founder of a $90 million cryptocurrency hedge fund, was sentenced to more than seven years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud.Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, a Swedish national accused by the United States of defrauding more than 3,500 victims of over $16 million, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed to this report."
2022-12-12,"Splits between U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors are delaying a long-running criminal investigation into the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The investigation began in 2018 and is focused on Binance's compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering laws and sanctions, these people said. A Binance spokesperson said, ""We don't have any insight into the inner workings of the US Justice Department, nor would it be appropriate for us to comment if we did."" The Justice Department declined to comment. Splits between U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors are delaying the conclusion of a long-running criminal investigation into the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, four people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.The investigation began in 2018 and is focused on Binance's compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering laws and sanctions, these people said. Some of the at least half dozen federal prosecutors involved in the case believe the evidence already gathered justifies moving aggressively against the exchange and filing criminal charges against individual executives including founder Changpeng Zhao, said two of the sources. Others have argued taking time to review more evidence, the sources said.The inquiry involves prosecutors at three Justice Department offices: the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, known as MLARS, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington in Seattle and the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. Justice Department regulations say that money laundering charges against a financial institution must be approved by the MLARS chief. Leaders from the other two offices, along with higher-level DOJ officials, would likely also have to sign off on any action against Binance, three of the sources said.Through interviews with almost a dozen people familiar with the case, including current and former U.S. law enforcement officials and ex-Binance advisors, along with a review of company records, Reuters has pieced together the most comprehensive account so far of how the investigation developed and how Binance has sought to keep it at bay. Prosecutors' deliberations on charging Binance have not been previously reported.The stakes are high for the deeply troubled crypto sector. If the investigation goes against Binance and Zhao, it could loosen Binance's grip on the industry. Its hold has been strengthened by the recent collapse of rival exchange FTX.Binance's defense attorneys at U.S. law firm Gibson Dunn have held meetings in recent months with Justice Department officials, the four people said. Among Binance's arguments: A criminal prosecution would wreak havoc on a crypto market already in a prolonged downturn. The discussions included potential plea deals, according to three of the sources.A Binance spokesperson initially told Reuters, ""We don't have any insight into the inner workings of the US Justice Department, nor would it be appropriate for us to comment if we did."" The Justice Department declined to comment.After publication, Binance released a statement on Twitter, saying ""Reuters has it wrong again.""""We are proud to have in our ranks some of the most celebrated cyber investigators representing virtually every single major law enforcement agency across the globe,"" the statement read.""Their hard work has directly resulted in a crypto ecosystem that has far less criminal activity on average than the traditional cash system,"" the statement continued.The charges under investigation are unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy and criminal sanctions violations, the four people said. No final charging decisions have been made, though prosecutors consider Zhao and some other executives to be subjects of the investigation, one source familiar with the situation said. Ultimately, the Justice Department could bring indictments against Binance and its executives, negotiate a settlement, or close the case without taking any action at all.Little has been revealed about the case. Reuters reported previously that in 2020, prosecutors requested extensive internal records from Binance about its anti-money laundering checks, along with communications involving Zhao and other executives.The new reporting shows that the case has shadowed Binance for most of its five years in existence, shaping Zhao's management of the company while he drove its explosive growth around the world. He instigated a recruitment spree last year that led to the hiring of officials from the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigation division, the U.S. government agency that was investigating Binance. He enforced strict secrecy rules on employees, telling them to use email as little as possible and to communicate using encrypted messaging services, according to company messages that Reuters has previously reported.Reuters has investigated Binance's financial crime compliance over the course of 2022. The reporting showed that Binance kept weak anti-money laundering controls, processed over $10 billion in payments for criminals and companies seeking to evade U.S. sanctions, and plotted to evade regulators in the United States and elsewhere.Binance has disputed the articles, calling the illicit-fund calculations inaccurate and the descriptions of its compliance controls ""outdated."" The exchange has said it is ""driving higher industry standards"" and seeking to ""further improve our ability to detect illegal crypto activity on our platform.""Launched by Zhao in Shanghai in 2017, Binance now dominates the crypto industry. The exchange processed trades worth around $1.6 trillion in October, about half of the entire crypto market's trading volume. That sum dwarfed its former challenger FTX, which handled $230 billion in trades that month, according to data site CryptoCompare.FTX imploded in early November, triggering a wave of public demands for greater regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried had boasted his exchange was the ""most regulated,"" but he based it in the Bahamas, where oversight was light, and secretly used customer deposits. The Justice Department has opened an investigation into FTX's handling of company funds, Reuters has reported. In a bankruptcy hearing, attorneys for FTX said the exchange was run as a ""personal fiefdom"" of Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried says he didn't knowingly commit any wrongdoing.People familiar with Justice Department operations said it is as yet unclear whether this new probe will add impetus to the investigation into Binance or slow it down.Zhao, who declines to disclose the location or entity behind his own exchange, accelerated his rival's fall by announcing that Binance would sell its holding of FTX's digital token. This sparked a surge of user withdrawals, ultimately forcing FTX to file for bankruptcy.In a blog post several days later, Zhao wrote that Binance ""must lead by example"" going forward. ""We cannot let a few bad actors sully the reputation of this industry,"" he wrote.""Lawyer up""Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle began investigating Binance in 2018, following a wave of cases that saw criminals use Binance to move illicit funds, the four people familiar with the probe said.The Seattle office partnered with MLARS to pursue the case, along with agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation division.Binance began to address the chances of U.S. enforcement action that year. A summary of a company meeting in October 2018, attended by Zhao, said, ""Lawyer up in the US, address regulatory risks.""The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, designed to protect the U.S. financial system from illicit finance, requires crypto exchanges to register with the Treasury Department and comply with anti-money laundering requirements if they conduct ""substantial"" business in the United States. Binance has never done so, despite almost a third of its users being U.S.-based the year of its launch, according to a company blog post.Instead, Zhao approved a proposal from a person providing advice to Binance to ""insulate"" Binance from U.S. scrutiny by setting up a new American exchange that would draw regulators' attention away from the main platform, as reported by Reuters in October. Zhao became concerned about U.S. authorities gaining access to Binance's internal records, company messages show.A guide issued to employees for one encrypted messaging service listed its ""automatic self-erasing messages"" as a benefit.Until 2020, Binance's legal department operated on bare bones. Its head of legal, Jared Gross, was a former mergers and acquisitions lawyer with little experience in dealing with authorities, according to two people who worked with him. Faced with the Justice Department investigation, Binance hired an external lawyer from U.S. law firm Paul Weiss, Roberto Gonzalez, who was previously Treasury's deputy general counsel. Gross, who left Binance last year, did not respond to messages and phone calls. Gonzalez and Paul Weiss didn't comment.In December 2020, two MLARS attorneys and a Seattle prosecutor sent the DOJ's request for documents to Binance, addressed to Gonzalez. The letter sought any records containing instructions that ""documents be destroyed, altered, or removed from Binance's files"" or that ""information should not be committed to writing."" The request asked for communications involving Zhao and 12 other Binance executives and advisors.Several days later, an advisor to one of the people named in the letter received a panicked phone call from this person. The caller told the advisor that Binance was struggling to respond to the DOJ because many of the records relevant to the Department's request had already been erased due to Zhao's secrecy rules. This extended, the person told the advisor, to Zhao's approvals for financial decisions at Binance.US, the separate American exchange which publicly says it is ""fully independent"" of the main Binance platform.A Binance.US spokesperson said Reuters' questions were ""fueled with false insinuations,"" and Binance.US was a separate entity with its own leadership team who are ""solely responsible for overseeing decisions and activity across the business.""Text messages and phone records reviewed by Reuters confirm the call took place and that it concerned the Department's December 2020 letter. The advisor described the contents of the call on the condition that Reuters not identify the advisor or the caller.Reuters, which was the first to disclose the request publicly, could not determine how Binance ultimately responded to the DOJ letter.New taskforceThe following year, Binance began a recruitment blitz. It hired at least five ex-officials from the IRS Criminal Investigation's Cyber Crime Unit, including a new global head of investigations called Tigran Gambaryan. Binance said Gambaryan's team would detect and prevent crimes on the platform and work closely with law enforcement.As an IRS-CI special agent, Gambaryan had helped lead investigations into several notorious crypto crime operations, such as the Silk Road darknet drugs marketplace and a child abuse site called Dark Scandals, whose operations Reuters detailed in an article last month. Gambaryan was not involved in the Binance investigation at IRS-CI, but was close to agents that were, according to two people who worked with him.His hiring was part of a recruitment program by Binance among law enforcement officials in the United States, offering salaries that far exceeded what was available at many other finance and crypto firms, according to four people familiar with the outreach.Gambaryan didn't respond to a request for comment. Binance told Reuters, ""We are proud to have in our ranks some of the most celebrated cyber investigators representing virtually every single major international law enforcement agency across the globe."" Binance said they have around 300 investigators working ""to protect users from illicit actors.""In August 2021, Binance ended a policy that allowed users to open accounts with solely an email address. Reuters has reported previously that criminals ranging from Russian drug traffickers to North Korean hackers had exploited this feature to move money anonymously through Binance.But even after Binance required all users to submit identification, gaps remained in its compliance program. For example, between then and this November, Binance processed over $1 billion in trades for Iranian crypto firms, putting the company at risk of violating U.S sanctions, Reuters reported last month.In October 2021, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco announced the creation of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) to tackle investigations of ""criminal misuses of cryptocurrency, particularly crimes committed by virtual currency exchanges."" Monaco, in a separate speech that month, said the Justice Department's ""first priority in corporate criminal matters"" was to prosecute individuals who profit from corporate wrongdoing.The Justice Department appointed Eun Young Choi, previously Monaco's senior counsel, as NCET's first director. Under Choi, NCET began coordinating the Binance investigation, joining the U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle and MLARS, according to the four people familiar with the case. Agents gathered evidence from former Binance employees and business partners, they said.In recent months, prosecutors at NCET and the Seattle office concluded they had sufficient evidence to prepare charges not only against Binance, but also against Zhao and some other executives, the people said. However, MLARS leadership has been hesitant to move forward with an indictment, leading to frustrations within the investigation team, the people said.MLARS has a reputation in the Justice Department for moving slowly in reaching prosecution decisions, people familiar with its activities said. In October, however, the Department appointed a new MLARS chief, Brent Wible, who previously worked in the Fraud Section and before that as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. Both of those offices are known, among current and former law enforcement officials, for pursuing cases more aggressively.Binance has hired a former chief of MLARS, Kendall Day, a partner at Gibson Dunn, to engage in discussions with the Justice Department. Day met with Justice officials in Washington in recent months, three of the people said. Officials discussed with Day a possible resolution to the case out of court, whereby suspects would potentially plead guilty or pay a fine, the three sources said. Day didn't comment.CNBC contributed to this report."
2022-12-13,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Tuesday outlined what needs to happen for the Federal Reserve to finally beat inflation.""Without a well-deserved crash in crypto and a sign of higher unemployment acknowledged by [Federal Reserve Chair] Jay Powell, this CPI reading has to be treated as a one-off number,"" he said. CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday outlined what needs to happen for the Federal Reserve to finally beat inflation after the monthly consumer price index report showed that prices rose less than expected in November.""Without a well-deserved crash in crypto and a sign of higher unemployment acknowledged by [Federal Reserve Chair] Jay Powell, this CPI reading has to be treated as a one-off number,"" he said.Cramer said that while the CPI data is a good sign for the Fed, the central bank needs to tamp down inflation in more areas of the economy, specifically in wages. This means that there needs to be much more wreckage in the job market, which is yet to be seen, he added.Yet another obstacle for the Fed is that speculative assets have managed to stay afloat, according to Cramer. Bitcoin jumped to its highest level in over a month on Tuesday after the cooler-than-expected CPI reading – despite the spectacle of crypto exchange FTX's collapse. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday charged former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried with misappropriating funds.""Today should have been a huge victory for Jay Powell on a speculation front because part of beating inflation is draining out the speculative juices in the economy. Yet, there's still a ton of juice left to be drained from crypto,"" Cramer said.Both high wages and the resilience in crypto suggest that the Fed still has a long way to go, he concluded.""The Fed has to start somewhere in the fight against inflation and today's a good beginning, but … [Powell's] got to crush inflation for good,"" he said.

2022-12-13,"This was CNBC's live blog covering Tuesday's hearing on the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX before the House Financial Services Committee.  The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing Tuesday on the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX following the Monday night arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas as U.S. regulators released a slew of civil and criminal charges against the one-time billionaire.The Justice Department and Bahamian authorities said Bankman-Fried, who was previously scheduled to testify before the panel, was arrested based on an indictment in the U.S. that was unsealed shortly after the hearing started.The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York charged the disgraced crypto executive with eight criminal counts: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations. John J. Ray, the company's new CEO and the panel's sole witness, told lawmakers the company had ""no record-keeping whatsoever,"" using bookkeeping software QuickBooks to track its multibillion dollar portfolio.""This is really just old fashioned embezzlement. This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose. Not sophisticated at all,"" Ray said in blistering testimony that lasted more than four hours. ""Sophisticated, perhaps in the way they are hiding something, frankly, right in front of their eyes. This is just plain old embezzlement. Old school, old school.""The company imploded and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month after reportedly transferring billions of dollars in FTX customer funds to Bankman-Fried's hedge fund, Alameda Research.The Securities and Exchange Commission also charged the former crypto ""darling"" Tuesday morning with allegedly ""orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX Trading,"" according to the agency.The Senate Banking Committee had also asked Bankman-Fried to testify at a Wednesday hearing that he previously refused to attend.Prior to his company's implosion, Bankman-Fried donated almost $40 million to candidates, campaigns and political action committees in the 2022 congressional midterm elections, with most of his publicly disclosed contributions going toward Democrats. Ryan Salame, the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, donated another $23 million, with the majority of his contributions heading toward Republicans.  Tue, Dec 13 20222:41 PM EST FTX CEO John J. Ray told the House Financial Services Committee that the cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried lied when he tweeted that the company ""has enough to cover all client holdings.""The since deleted tweet was published by Bankman-Fried on Nov. 7, just days before he stepped down as CEO of FTX and his company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.""Absolutely not,"" Ray said after committee member Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., asked whether that tweet was accurate. ""So that statement was false?"" Torres asked. ""Yes,"" Ray replied.—  Brian Schwartz  Tue, Dec 13 20221:21 PM EST Bankman-Fried allowed about 1,500 people in the Bahamas to withdraw roughly $100 million 24 hours before the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while other investors were locked out of their accounts, Ray confirmed to lawmakers.Ray told lawmakers much was still uncertain, but ""what we do know is that the liquidation proceeding in the Bahamas was filed effectively hours before the chapter 11 proceeding. During that time period [...] the accounts were unfrozen just in the Bahamas [and over $100 million was released [to] approximately 1,500 customers in the Bahamas.""Court filings from Ray's attorneys at Sullivan & Cromwell provide more context for the brief window that gave Bahamian account holders precedence over other creditors.Bankman-Fried opened the window after Bahamian regulators pressed him about the crisis at FTX days before its Nov. 11 bankruptcy filing, which the company said on Twitter it was doing at the behest of Bahaman rules and its regulators.The Securities Commission of The Bahamas shot back two days later, saying it didn't direct, authorize or otherwise suggest that FTX prioritize the withdrawals for Bahamian clients.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 202212:14 PM EST Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, slammed a copy of Bankman-Fried's written testimony.""This testimony is so disrespectful,"" Rep. Cleaver said. Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify, but didn't show after Bahamian authorities arrested him Monday night. The fallen CEO planned to tell lawmakers he ""f*cked up,"" according to Forbes magazine, which posted a copy of his written testimony. The Missouri Democrat quipped that he couldn't even say the next two words as he read the script out loud during the hearing. Bankman-Fried said FTX's current CEO Ray and his team refused to return credentials Bankman-Fried said he needed to access to answer questions before the committee and of failing to respond to a number of emails.""Mr. Ray has never responded, nor has he reached out to me to communicate in other ways,"" the remarks say.— Chelsey Cox  Tue, Dec 13 202211:56 AM EST The Commodity Futures Trading Commission unveiled its own charges against Bankman-Fried as Ray testified about alleged wrongdoing at FTX. The CFTC's charges say Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's hedge fund, enjoyed access to as much as $8 billion in customer funds in an account nominally on FTX's books but controlled by and in the name of Alameda.From the very founding of FTX in 2019, the CFTC alleges that Alameda ""accessed and used FTX customer funds for Alameda's own operations and activities, including to fund its trading, investment, and borrowing/lending activities.""The CFTC filing echoes charges that the SEC unveiled earlier Tuesday, which said that Bankman-Fried operated his empire as a fraud ""from the start.""— Rohan Goswami and MacKenzie Sigalos  Tue, Dec 13 202211:42 AM EST U.S. prosecutors unsealed their indictment accusing Bankman-Fried of widespread fraud, a day after the fallen crypto exchange operator was arrested in the Bahamas on the charges.The indictment in U.S. District Court in Manhattan charges Bankman-Fried with eight criminal counts: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations.Prosecutors allege in the indictment that the former billionaire was engaging in criminal activity that began as far back as 2019 and continued through last month.Bankman-Fried deliberately and knowingly ""agreed with others to defraud customers of FTX.com by misappropriating those customers' deposits and using those deposits to pay expenses and debts of Alameda Research,"" the indictment alleges.It also accuses Bankman-Fried of conspiring with others to defraud FTX's lenders ""by providing false and misleading information to those lenders regarding Alameda Research's financial condition.""— Rohan Goswami and MacKenzie Sigalos  Tue, Dec 13 202211:38 AM EST Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., said Bankman-Fried, was lobbying Congress in order to keep the SEC from regulating the nascent industry.Bankman-Fried was a ""well-known figure"" in Congress and ""his one purpose was to keep the SEC out of crypto.""The disgraced crypto executive regularly met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill and was a prolific campaign financier, contributing nearly $40 million in publicly disclosed donations toward the 2022 midterm elections. The majority of his contributions toward federal campaigns were directed to Democrats.Bankman-Fried was recently arrested in the Bahamas. The SEC charged the former FTX executive with orchestrating a ""massive, years-long fraud"" in which he allegedly diverted billions of dollars of the trading platform's customer funds for ""his own personal benefit.Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York unsealed eight separate charges against Bankman-Fried, including several counts of conspiracy and fraud. They also charged Bankman-Fried with violating campaign finance laws.— Brian Schwartz  Tue, Dec 13 202211:25 AM EST FTX's troubles began ""months, if not years"" before it filed for bankruptcy, Ray testified.The crypto exchange had been intermingling its assets with Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's hedge fund, for a while, he said.""There was a public distinction"" between FTX.com and FTX.us, but in reality user data was amalgamated between the two,"" Ray testified. The crypto exchange collapsed after it came to light that Alameda had been using FTX customer assets to cover trading losses.""The owners of the company could really run free-rein"" between all of FTX international, FTX US', and Alameda Research's assets, Ray testified.""We've been able to secure over $1 billion in assets,"" the newly appointed FTX CEO said, but it could take weeks, even months to secure all of FTX's assets, he said.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 202211:16 AM EST Bankman-Fried recently said in an interview that all of his Republican donations during the 2022 election cycle went to so-called ""dark"" money groups.That move allowed him to avoid publicly disclosing which GOP leaning organizations he backed, he noted in a November YouTube interview with crypto blogger Tiffany Fong. These types of ""dark"" nonprofit groups allow donors to give an unlimited of money, without having to disclose their names.Bankman-Fried said he gave ""about the same amount"" to both parties throughout the recent midterm elections. If that's true, Bankman-Fried could have given close to $80 million between Republicans and Democrats during the 2022 election cycle. The now arrested FTX founder gave almost $40 million toward campaigns and political action committees in the 2022 cycle, with most those funds focusing on helping Democrats, according to data from OpenSecrets.Since that interview, CNBC asked Bankman-Fried over Twitter messages which ""dark"" money groups he supported and how much he donated to each organization. He never responded to those requests for comment.An ethics watchdog group has asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for alleged ""serious violations"" of election law, citing his admitted contributions of ""dark"" money to Republican-aligned groups during the 2022 primary season.— Brian Schwartz  Tue, Dec 13 202211:07 AM EST Federal prosecutors on Tuesday accused the disgraced crypto executive, who made nearly $40 million in publicly disclosed political donations in the 2022 election cycle, with violating multiple campaign finance laws.A newly unsealed indictment in Manhattan federal court says Bankman-Fried and others violated numerous federal campaign finance laws, including giving contributions of at least $25,000 to campaigns and political action committees ""in the names of other persons.""The charge, which is included among multiple other criminal counts against the fallen crypto exchange CEO, comes days after a private watchdog group asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate Bankman-Fried for campaign finance violations.— Brian Schwartz  Tue, Dec 13 202211:04 AM EST FTX's new CEO Ray told lawmakers the company used Intuit's QuickBooks bookkeeping software to manage its multibillion dollar portfolio.""Quickbooks?!"" Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., asked.Ray said the scandal at FTX was in some ways worse than the 2001 failure of energy trading firm Enron, which cost shareholders $74 billion and left 21 executives, auditors and other people convicted of crimes.""It's unusual in the sense that there's no record-keeping whatsoever [...] employees would communicate invoices and expensing on Slack,"" he said.""I don't want to speak to detailed regulations,"" Ray testified, but ""my basic observation is that you need records, you need controls, and you need to segregate people's money.""Ray specializes in recovering assets from bankrupt companies. He's most well-known for his work as chairman of Enron after its collapse. He helped Enron's creditors recover more than $800 million, which he's said was about 52 cents on the dollar.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 202210:45 AM EST Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, called Bankman-Fried's arrest ""welcome news."" Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas Monday after the United States District Attorney for the Southern District of New York shared a sealed indictment with Bahamian officials.""He was scheduled to testify under oath before this committee day,"" Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said in her opening remarks. ""Unfortunately, the timing of this arrest in the eyes of the public the opportunity to answer this issue, that this committee will not stop until we uncovered the full truth.""— Chelsey Cox  Tue, Dec 13 202210:39 AM EST Sam Bankman-Fried is in Bahamian custody ahead of an anticipated extradition to the United States, but FTX faces regulatory probes that extend beyond U.S. borders.Regulators at the Securities Commission of the Bahamas have already begun to unpack the final, chaotic days at FTX with a likely eye towards charging Bankman-Fried.The Cyprus SEC had suspended FTX's European license just prior to FTX's Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing, but has complained that John J. Ray, FTX's new CEO, has stymied efforts at an investigation, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.In Turkey, regulators have already seized ""suspicious"" FTX assets with a likely eye to a deeper probe into FTX's operations there. FTX operated at least two subsidiary companies in Turkey.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 20229:20 AM EST FTX's new CEO, John J. Ray, will tell lawmakers about a $5 billion ""spending binge"" by former FTX executives Sam Bankman-Fried and Ryan Salame in the months before the firm's collapse, according to a copy of his written testimony released by the committee Monday night.Ray took over as the FTX chief as the crypto empire hurtled toward Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Beyond the multibillion-dollar spending spree, Ray's written testimony confirms that customer assets from FTX were commingled with assets from Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's hedge fund.""Many things are unknown at this stage,"" Ray's testimony reads.— Rohan Goswami  Tue, Dec 13 20229:04 AM EST Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler didn't mince words in charging Bankman-Fried with running what the agency said was a scheme to defraud investors, saying the crypto trading platform ""operated behind a veneer of legitimacy.""""We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,"" Gensler said. ""The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.""The one-time crypto billionaire was charged with violating the Securities Act of 1933, which basically prohibits issuers of securities from deceiving investors as well as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which regulates securities once they're traded in the open market.The agency said it's looking into more possible violations as well as other entities and people tied to FTX.— Dawn Kopecki  Tue, Dec 13 20228:32 AM EST U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said the Justice Department plans to unseal its indictment against Bankman-Fried Tuesday morning.The one-time crypto billionaire was arrested by authorities in the Bahamas after he was reportedly charged by the Southern District of New York with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.Neither the Attorney General of the Bahamas nor the Royal Bahamas Police Force would confirm the nature of the charges against Bankman-Fried.— Dawn Kopecki "
2022-12-13,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, paused withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC on Tuesday while it carried out a ""token swap.""USDC withdrawals were resumed about 8 hours after Binance first announced the pausing of withdrawals.Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, tweeted on Tuesday that the exchange is seeing an increase in withdrawals of USDC.The move comes as investor concerns grow about Binance's stability following the collapse of rival exchange FTX as well as a report of a potential criminal investigation from the U.S. government. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, paused withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC on Tuesday while it carried out a ""token swap.""USDC withdrawals were resumed about 8 hours after Binance first announced the pausing of withdrawals.The move came as investor concerns grow about Binance's stability following the collapse of rival exchange FTX as well as a report of a potential criminal investigation from the U.S. government.Binance said earlier on Tuesday it had ""temporarily paused"" USDC withdrawals while it does a ""token swap."" This involves swapping one cryptocurrency for another without the need for fiat currency.Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, tweeted that the exchange is seeing an increase in withdrawals of USDC, a cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin because it is pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar.USDC is used by investors to trade in and out of different cryptocurrencies without the need to move money back into U.S. dollars. If traders are withdrawing USDC from Binance, it could be to move it onto another platform.Zhao said that any transfers into USDC from the stablecoin known as PAX, as well as Binance's own token BUSD, require routing through a bank based in New York which is not yet open. The suggestion from Zhao is that users are looking to convert their PAX and BUSD into USDC in order to withdraw their funds from Binance.A token swap could be a way for Binance to get more USDC quickly while the banks are closed in order to resume withdrawals for customers.Zhao said users could still withdraw other stablecoins including BUSD and tether. Deposits are not affected, he said.Binance's own token called BNB was trading down about 5% on Tuesday morning, according to data from CoinGecko.It's not normally good news when a crypto firm has to pause withdrawals. In the summer, crypto firms including lender Celsius had to pause withdrawals before ultimately filing for bankruptcy. There is no indication of any such trouble for Binance.In the past 24 hours, Binance has seen $1.6 billion of outflows from its platform, according to a tweet from crypto data company Nansen published early Tuesday. Binance has more than $60 billion of assets on its platform, Nansen said. The collapse of FTX and arrest of its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has crypto investors on edge with fears of further contagion across the industry.Binance has been in the spotlight since its decision to sell its stake in FTX's self-issued FTT digital tokens, which preceded the failure of the rival exchange.Investors have called for more transparency from Binance's business. Last month, the company issued a proof of reserve in which it claims to have a reserve ratio of 101%. That means it has enough assets to cover customer deposits. But critics have said that the proof of reserves have not gone far enough to give assurances of Binance's collateral. Mazars, the auditing firm Binance used for its proof of reserves, said in its five-page report that the company does ""not express an opinion or an assurance conclusion.""Investors are also keeping tabs on a report from Reuters that U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors are delaying the conclusion of a criminal investigation into Binance. Reuters, citing four people familiar with the matter, reported that the investigation is focused on Binance's compliance with anti-money laundering laws. Binance responded saying: ""Reuters has it wrong again.""""We don't have any insight into the inner workings of the US Justice Department, nor would it be appropriate for us to comment if we did,"" the company said in a tweet on Monday."
2022-12-15,"Shaquille O'Neal wants to make one thing clear: He doesn't believe in crypto, if he ever did.That's after being named in a class-action lawsuit against now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX last month, for promoting the company in a June commercial.In an interview with CNBC Make It this week, the 50-year-old businessman and Basketball Hall of Famer took questions about his relationship with FTX while discussing his other business ventures.O'Neal has a long history of investing in companies he promotes, including his current enterprise, Shaq's Fun House, an annual part-festival, part-carnival event. Those investments often pan out: O'Neal makes more off the court than he did as an NBA star, he told HBO's ""Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel"" in 2018.But when it comes to FTX, he says, he was merely a celebrity in an ad.""A lot of people think I'm involved, but I was just a paid spokesperson for a commercial,"" O'Neal says. On Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried of orchestrating a ""brazen"" years-long fraud, misusing customer funds to benefit himself and his crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research.Bankman-Fried was arrested on Monday by Bahamian authorities, likely leading to extradition and a U.S. trial, CNBC reported. He'll face at least eight charges from federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, including several counts of conspiracy and fraud. Customers have been unable to withdraw funds from FTX since the company declared bankruptcy last month. As many as one million creditors, according to an FTX bankruptcy filing, are unsure if they'll ever get their money back.The class-action lawsuit naming O'Neal is a legal proceeding separate from the federal government's charges. It alleges that FTX's spokespeople ""either controlled, promoted, assisted in [or] actively participated"" in a plot to ""aggressively market"" the company.Other athletes and celebrities from FTX's commercials — including Steph Curry, Tom Brady, and comedian Larry David — were also named in the lawsuit. Texas is now separately investigating some celebrity FTX endorsers for potentially violating state securities laws, according to Bloomberg. The ex-basketball star's commercial was somewhat of a surprise: Last year, O'Neal told CNBC Make It that he was actively avoiding cryptocurrency.""I don't understand it, so I will probably stay away from it until I get a full understanding of what it is,"" he said, adding: ""From my experience, it is too good to be true.""O'Neal told Front Office Sports last year that he'd declined promotional offers from various crypto entities.""I always get these companies that say, 'Hey, we'll give you $900,000 in crypto to send out a tweet,'"" O'Neal said. ""So I have to say, 'OK, if you're going to give me a million dollars worth of crypto, then why do you need me?'""He may have had a change of heart in late 2021, though: Over the past year, O'Neal changed his Twitter display name to ""SHAQ.ETH"" and ""SHAQ.SOL"" to promote NFT collections underpinned by the Ethereum and Solana cryptocurrency platforms.""I'm excited to be partnering with FTX to help make crypto accessible to everyone,"" O'Neal said in the June commercial. ""I'm all in. Are you?""Today, O'Neal cites his friendship with Curry as a reason he consented to appear in the ad. A spokesperson for Curry declined to comment.In the ad, O'Neal told viewers that he checked his FTX account daily. But when asked now if he's bullish on crypto, he offers a simple response: ""No.""""People know I'm very, very honest,"" O'Neal says. ""I have nothing to hide. If I was heavily involved, I would be at the forefront saying, 'Hey.' But I was just a paid spokesperson.""It's unclear how much money O'Neal made from his FTX endorsement deal. Investor and entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary, who also endorsed FTX and is named in the suit, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last week that he was paid $15 million by FTX, and lost it all: $9.7 million that he'd invested with FTX, more than $1 million in FTX equity and approximately $4 million in taxes and agent fees.O'Leary said the money he lost was his alone. ""We need to get to the bottom of what happened at FTX, but we can't let its collapse cause us to abandon the great promise and potential of crypto,"" he testified to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday.Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss: Harvard-educated deception expert: 4 red flags can show when people like Sam Bankman-Fried are lying"
2022-12-15,"Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao dismissed concerns over whether Binance could handle a potential $2.1 billion clawback of proceeds from an FTX divestment on an appearance with CNBC's Squawk Box.Zhao was an early investor in FTX and in disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried, but their relationship had chilled as FTX gained market share and grew more competitive.Binance divested its stake in FTX well before bankruptcy. Binance Chief Executive Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao dismissed concerns that his company could have $2.1 billion clawed back as a result of FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, in an appearance Thursday morning on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" and said he trusted his lawyers to handle the proceedings.CNBC'S Andrew Ross Sorkin and Becky Quick pressed Zhao on whether he expected to be able to return that $2.1 billion payment from FTX, which Binance earned when it exited its 2019 Series A investment with FTX, to bankruptcy trustees who will be looking to claw back any fraudulent conveyances made by FTX to outside businesses or investors.""Would you be able to handle it if somebody asked you for $2.1 billion back,"" Quick asked him.""We are financially OK,"" Zhao said, evading a straight answer. If bankruptcy proceedings can establish that a payment was made through proceedings of fraud or that an individual should have reasonably known that a payment was fraudulent, any beneficiary in a two-year lookback window can have their gains clawed back by the trustee, according to the U.S. bankruptcy code.""Are you prepared to send that money to them?"" Sorkin asked Zhao.""I think we'll leave that to the lawyers. I think our legal team is perfectly capable of handling it,"" Zhao responded before attempting to pivot away to FTX's well-documented spending habits.Zhao told Sorkin that the repayment was a combination of BUSD, BNB and FTT tokens. Zhao claimed that the FTT portion of the repayment was significant but that the company had ""forgotten"" about it.""We have very solid revenue,"" Zhao said.Lawyers for FTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

The committee, which was created after the financial crisis to identify looming risks to the financial system, reiterated its call for Congress to pass legislation that allows U.S. regulators to police spot markets for crypto assets that aren't securities.The council also said lawmakers need to address regulatory arbitrage, when companies take advantage of more favorable or lighter regulation in multiple jurisdictions to circumvent tighter oversight in the U.S.The group uses data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, among other agencies, to spotlight fraud in crypto. Of 8,300 crypto complaints received by the CFPB's Consumer Complaint Database between October 2018 and September 2022, 40% appeared to be a ""fraud or scam.""Over 46,000 people lost more than $1 billion on crypto trading to scams and fraud between Jan. 1, 2021 through March 31, according to the FTC.Since fiscal year 2019, the SEC has received over 23,000 tips, complaints and referrals involving the crypto markets.But while FTX's failure ""precipitated price decreases in Bitcoin and other crypto-assets,"" there has been ""limited impact on the broader U.S. financial system"" due to the current regulatory framework, according to the report.The committee warned that this could rapidly change if participants in the crypto and traditional financial systems continue to devise ways to overlap, therefore increasing the urgency for more regulatory oversight.Traditional banks, for instance, hold stablecoin as part of their reserve assets, retail investors are increasingly using leverage to trade crypto currencies and  crypto has also become more widely available through some traditional financial service companies.  Stablecoin is considered to be a less risky type of crypto currency because it seeks to reduce price volatility by deriving its value from a fixed traditional currency or commodity, like the U.S. dollar or gold. ""Such interconnections would broaden the effects of shocks that originate inside the digital asset ecosystem,"" the report states."
2022-12-16,"Investor Kevin O'Leary appeared on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to face questioning over his thoughts on disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and O'Leary's involvement with FTX.O'Leary insisted that every individual was entitled to the presumption of innocence under the law.""There are a lot of bad things that have been alleged here, and a lot of them are going to be true, likely,"" O'Leary said. ""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O'Leary defended his position as a spokesperson for bankrupt crypto firm FTX on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday.""This is America. The justice system provides the presumption of innocence unless proven otherwise,"" O'Leary responded when asked why he didn't more stridently condemn Bankman-Fried. The former FTX CEO was arrested by Bahamian authorities earlier this week, pending extradition and trial to face charges in U.S. federal court.O'Leary was pressed on his paid FTX ambassadorship, venture capital career and his defense of Sam Bankman-Fried days before his arrest, by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin, Joe Kernen and Becky Quick.Kernen minced no words with the Canadian businessman. ""Are you still calling yourself a venture investor?"" the Squawk Box host asked O'Leary. ""Your venture investing was your name being able to used as a spokesperson?""""Joe, bad news. I have a very large advisory business,"" O'Leary retorted. Kernen continued to press O'Leary. ""Are you still conflating money you got paid by FTX that you lost, or did you actually invest some of your own funds?""""Money is fungible,"" O'Leary replied. ""So you didn't. Once again, you're a venture investor who ventured your name,"" Kernan said. ""You didn't even pay your own money on the taxes.""O'Leary continued to return to his lost $10 million investment in FTX, which was given to him as part of his compensation for appearing as a paid spokesperson. Traditional venture investing typically involves a fund or individual investing their own funds in a business.""They had to open that round for me,"" O'Leary said. ""I have 54 companies in my portfolio right now.""""Kevin, you are an actor in this drama, and you had a front-row seat to Bankman-Fried up until the very end,"" Sorkin said. ""What do you think happened? Do you think this was a fraud?""""I don't have the facts. [New FTX CEO] John Ray doesn't have them yet. He's going to get them,"" O'Leary responded. ""I'm looking through my records. I'm willing to fund a forensic account of our accounts."" ""There are a lot of bad things that have been alleged here, and a lot of them are going to be true, likely,"" he added.But at the same time, O'Leary said he wasn't inclined to indulge outraged investors on Twitter.""I understand that the herd is angry,"" the businessman, who is also a CNBC contributor, said.Sorkin also observed that, as opposed to Tom Brady or Larry David, investors might expect that O'Leary knew better than most how to understand if FTX was problematic or not.""Companies advertise, and they do it this way,"" O'Leary said.Kernen also pressed O'Leary on his rapid about-face on bitcoin.""Did that conversion coincide with the $15 million you got from FTX?"" Kernen asked. ""No,"" O'Leary said, stating that his bitcoin investing began years before his ambassadorship for FTX, in 2018.But Sorkin pointed to a 2019 television appearance and noted that O'Leary called bitcoin ""garbage.""""Then I'm wrong about that,"" O'Leary said. ""The point is, it was long before I became a paid spokesperson. Long before.""""I love getting sandpapered by you guys every day. It's fantastic,"" O'Leary concluded.Disclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to ""Shark Tank."""
2022-12-19,"The campaign finance violations detailed in a 14-page indictment against one-time crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried are numerous and varied.Prosecutors accuse the FTX founder of conspiring with others to make and receive illegal campaign donations, hide them, misuse corporate contributions and of improperly using a conduits to hide who was giving the money.Campaign finance records show that his hedge fund, Alameda Research, donated $5 million in 2020 to the pro-Biden Future Forward USA. Before FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on multiple criminal securities fraud violations Dec. 12, he was considered the crypto ""darling"" of Washington, helpfully testifying before Congress, meeting with regulators and lavishly spending tens of millions on political campaigns.U.S. prosecutors say at least some of that money came from Alameda Research, a hedge fund he founded. He and his co-conspirators allegedly diverted billions of dollars in customer funds from FTX to Alameda that were then misused in a variety of ways, including to donate to political candidates and campaigns, federal prosecutors said.The campaign finance violations detailed in a 14-page indictment are numerous and varied. Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York accuse Bankman-Fried of conspiring with others to make and receive illegal campaign donations, hide those donations, misuse corporate donations and of improperly using a conduit to hide the donations. Bankman-Fried ""and others known and unknown"" also allegedly gave money under other people's names and exceeded limits on political contributions, according to the indictment.While prosecutors don't name Bankman-Fried's co-conspirators, they said he worked with ""others, known and unknown, (who) knowingly did combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to defraud the United States"" to intentionally skirt campaign finance laws, according to the indictment. Prosecutors are reportedly looking at former FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh, the co-CEO of FTX digital markets Ryan Salame, as well as contributions by Alameda Research and FTX, The New York Times reported. Bankman-Fried, Singh and Salame, combined, contributed at least $70 million toward the 2022 midterms, according to data from nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets.Singh and Salame did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Bankman-Fried declined to comment.Bankman-Fried became a prolific political donor in recent years, giving almost $40 million in publicly disclosed contributions mostly to Democrats in the 2022 midterm races. State and federal campaign finance data and nonprofit records show a number of questionable donations now under increased scrutiny that indicate Bankman-Fried could have spent millions more than previously disclosed currying favor with Washington lawmakers. He's publicly admitted that he also gave roughly $40 million to Republicans during the campaign cycle, although those payments weren't publicly disclosed and aren't counted toward his total donations.None of the groups, candidates or nonprofits that received donations from Bankman-Fried or his executives have been charged with any crimes, and the indictment notes that just because a group receives a donation later deemed illegal does not mean they had any knowledge it was. The New York Times reported that prosecutors have sent emails seeking more information from Democrats and Republicans on some of the donations.Bankman-Fried and his colleagues were also generous donors to charities and political causes championed by his family. The disgraced CEO donated to his brother Gabe Bankman-Fried's nonprofit organization, Guarding Against Pandemics. Bankman-Fried's mother, Barbara Fried, ran Mind the Gap, a super PAC that backed mostly Democratic issues. Singh personally donated $1 million to the group.Mind the Gap reportedly worked as a donor advisory group that helps Democrats raise campaign cash, but it made zero publicly disclosed donations to candidates, parties or other political action committees, according to OpenSecrets.Alameda Research donated more than $12 million to Gabe Bankman-Fried's nonprofit since late last year, according to California state campaign finance records. Guarding Against Pandemics used the funds to help finance a campaign to support a California ballot initiative that would levy a special tax against people making more than $5 million a year to fight future pandemics, according to state records. The ballot measure will be voted on in the 2024 election.The nonprofit wiped all traces of the Bankman-Fried brothers off its website after FTX filed for bankruptcy in November, including a mention of Sam Bankman-Fried as one of its donors. The website doesn't mention Alameda as a sponsor, even though almost one-fourth of its total donations last year came from the hedge fund, records show. The nonprofit spent over $1 million since last year lobbying the federal government on pandemic-related matters, including engaging with White House officials, according to disclosure reports.The group's 2021 tax record, which was obtained by CNBC, shows the organization raised $22 million last year. The organization does not publicly disclose its donors on that form. California state campaign finance records show Alameda donated $5 million to Guarding Against Pandemics last year and $7.1 million this year.A representative for Guarding Against Pandemics didn't respond to a request for comment.""This appears to be yet another example of diversion of FTX customer funds without the knowledge or consent of FTX customers,"" Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer in George W. Bush's White House, told CNBC after reviewing the donations. ""An open question is how much the recipient of these funds — whether political candidates or Gabe's nonprofit — knew about the true source of the funds they had received — i.e. that they had FTX customer money."" While Guarding Against Pandemics boasts on its tax filing that the group ""advocates for public investments to prevent the next pandemic,"" its 2021 records show it donated to at least two groups aligned with the Democratic Party.The charity donated $100,000 to the House Majority Forward, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit affiliated with House Majority PAC, according to the tax form. Both groups work to help Democrats get elected to the House of Representatives. The House Majority PAC received a $6 million donation from Sam Bankman-Fried during the 2022 election.Guarding Against Pandemics also gave $1 million to Voto Latino Action Fund, a nonprofit voter registration group. A spokesman for Voto Latino said an email that ""Guarding Against Pandemics gave us funding to oppose [Democratic] Governor Newsom's recall; the funds were received and spent in connection with that effort last year. There are no funds remaining from this organization.""Guarding Against Pandemics also paid political communications and media company GMMB just over $690,000 last year for advertising and production, its tax form says. That firm received $24 million from various Democratic campaigns during the 2022 elections, according to OpenSecrets. Jim Margolis, a founding partner of GMMB, served as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 runs for the White House.A spokesman for GMMB told CNBC that the payment from Guarding Against Pandemics to the firm was for a ""media buy.""""This was a media buy placed for Guarding Against Pandemics.  GMMB was not involved in developing the strategy, creative or production of the advertising and simply placed the media buy with stations like NBC Universal who were the beneficiaries of the ad spending. It was not a fee for GMMB,"" the spokesman said. Alameda Research also delved into politics, donating $5.24 million in 2020 to Future Forward USA, a super PAC that backed President Joe Biden's White House win, according to Federal Election Commission records. Bankman-Fried separately donated $5 million to the super PAC that cycle. A representative for the PAC did not respond to a request for comment.While U.S. prosecutors didn't release details of specific donations, they said Bankman-Fried ""and his co-conspirators made millions of dollars in political contributions funded by Alameda Research to federal political candidates and committees in advance of the 2022 election.""""To conceal the fact that those contributions were paid for using funds from a corporation and to evade contribution limits and reporting requirements, Bankman-Fried caused contributions to be reported in the names of co-conspirators rather than in the name of the true source of the funds,"" they said in a press release announcing the indictment.Stuart McPhail, an attorney from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the Future Forward donation could have violated campaign finance laws if Alameda was posing as a front for someone else.""It would be illegal, however, if Alameda was not the true source of the funds, but was merely a conduit for someone else's money,"" McPhail said in an email to CNBC. ""Of course, it would also break other laws, outside of campaign finance, if Alameda was stealing money to make those contributions. Given the DOJ's, the SEC's, and the CFTC's allegations, it is quite possible that is what happened."" The ethics group filed a complaint to the FEC before Bankman-Fried's arrest, asking them to investigate the former FTX CEO for alleged ""serious violations"" of election law. They cited Bankman-Fried's admitted contributions of ""dark"" money to Republican election efforts during the 2022 primary season. A Las Vegas-based fintech company called Prime Trust was listed as donating $14 million in February and March to Protect Our Future, a super PAC that backed Democrats during the 2022 primary season, FEC filings show. That money, however, reportedly came from Sam Bankman-Fried and Singh, according to Politico.Erin Holloway, the president of global marketing for Prime Trust, told the outlet at the time that the company was ""identified in the PAC filing solely because the transferred funds were held in an account under Prime Trust's name for the benefit of a specific customer, and Prime Trust originated the wire transfer at the direction of that customer.""Though Prime Trust didn't say at the time who the client was, Scott Purcell, the company's founder, told CNBC, ""I know that FTX was a customer of Prime Trust."" FTX, at the time, told Politico that the customer Prime Trust referred to in its explanation of the donation was Bankman-Fried.The Oregon State Democratic Party reported a $500,000 donation labeled as being from Prime Trust, which turned out to be from Singh, according to The Oregonian/Oregon Live. CNBC discovered other October filings that say they originated from Prime Trust, including contributions to the campaign of Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., as well as the successful Democratic gubernatorial campaigns of Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico and Laura Kelly of Kansas. The campaign of Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., also picked up a donation from Prime Trust in October.The company confirmed in an email that FTX.US was a Prime Trust customer.""When a customer makes a payment through Prime Trust ... the bank processing the payment includes Prime Trust's name in payment instructions because the payment is from an account in our name,"" Matt Parrella, Prime Trust's general counsel, told CNBC in a statement. ""The recipient (i.e., PAC) will have to look beyond account name to determine the donor.""Representatives for Warnock, Lujan Grisham, Correa and Kelly did not respond to requests for comment.Brendan Fischer, the deputy executive director at the watchdog group Documented, told CNBC in an email that the October contributions were ""surprising"" and the FEC would likely ask the campaigns to refund those donations or attribute them to an individual.""Campaign committees cannot accept corporate contributions, and can only accept contributions from LLCs taxed as partnerships and where the contribution is attributed to the partners,"" Fischer said. ""The FEC is going to follow up with Warnock and Correa and ask that the Prime Trust contributions be refunded or attributed to an individual."""
2022-12-19,"The collapse of FTX, once a $32 billion crypto exchange, has shattered investor confidence in cryptocurrencies.Louise Abbott, a partner at law firm Keystone Law, told CNBC the exchange's demise is ""devastating for investors.""The disaster has set back adoption of crypto assets by ""one or two years,"" according to Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute. The collapse of FTX, once a $32 billion crypto exchange, has shattered investor confidence in cryptocurrencies. Market players are trying to gauge the extent of damage it has caused — and how it will reshape the industry in the years to come.Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's former boss who stepped down on Nov. 11, was arrested in the Bahamas last week. He has been charged by the U.S. government with wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering.FTX connected buyers and sellers of digital currencies like bitcoin, as well as derivatives. However, the company did more than that, allegedly dipping into client accounts to make risky trades through its sister firm Alameda Research.""It's hugely disappointing for investors, or more so devastating for investors,"" said Louise Abbott, a partner at law firm Keystone Law who specializing in crypto-asset recovery and fraud.It's clear the FTX drama could radically reshape crypto in the years to come. Here are three big ways the industry could change. For one, the disaster will looks certain to stir regulators into action.Crypto as an industry is still largely unregulated, meaning investors don't have the same protections they would have placing their funds with a licensed bank or broker.That may be about to change. Governments in the U.S., European Union and the U.K. are taking steps to clean up the market. The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets is the most comprehensive regulatory framework to date. It aims to reduce the risks for consumers buying crypto, making exchanges liable if they lose investors' assets.But MICA is not due to start until 12 months from now. Keystone Law's Abbott said it's important that regulators act quickly.""People need to see that there's steps being taken to regulate it. And I think If we are able to offer some regulation, we will build confidence,"" she said. ""If there's no regulation, the investors are left without that protection that they need.""

""When you do have that centralization, you need to have proper oversight and a proper balance of power."" Many new companies and projects emerged in the years that followed the 2018 crypto winter — FTX among them. The expectation now is that fewer firms and coins will exist in the years to come.Contagion from the FTX saga is already playing out.Crypto lender BlockFi, which earlier sought financial assistance from FTX, has entered bankruptcy. Now, attention is turning to other trading and lending firms, like Gemini and Genesis. ""The challenge for the whole space when you think about contagion is that FTX and Alameda were extremely active investors in this space,"" Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain.com, said in a CNBC-moderated talk at a crypto conference in London.Near Foundation, which is behind a blockchain network called Near, was among the firms that took investment from FTX. Marieke Flament, Near's CEO, said the firm had limited exposure to FTX — though the collapse was still ""a surprise and a shock.""""I don't think all the dominoes have fallen out from the contagion,"" Flament said. ""The impact that this will have is that a lot of projects actually are not going to have the funds, and therefore the resources, for them to continue and develop."" Fears have risen over the financial health of other major crypto exchanges after FTX's failure. Since early 2020, about 900,000 bitcoins have flowed out of exchanges, according to data from CryptoQuant.Binance, the world's largest exchange, is facing questions about the reserves it holds to backstop customer funds. The company saw billions of dollars in outflows in the past week.Currently, there is no reason to suspect Binance faces any risk of bankruptcy. But exchanges like Binance and Coinbase face a bleak market backdrop ahead amid falling trading volumes and account balances.Experts believe they'll continue to play a role — though their survival will be determined by how seriously they take risk management, governance and regulation. ""There will be exchanges that are doing things the right way and that will survive,"" said Abbott. Loading chart... As for tokens — bitcoin, being the longest-living digital currency, may be better positioned than its smaller rivals.""My bet would be that bitcoin and DeFi [decentralized finance] are decoupled from the rest of crypto and actually start to have a life of its own,"" Gaevoy from Wintermute told CNBC. Despite the depressed state of crypto markets, and the toll it's taken on investors, the digital asset industry is likely to pull through.Proponents of ""Web3,"" a hypothetical blockchain-based internet, expect 2022's crypto winter to pave the way for more innovative uses of blockchain, rather than the speculative uses crypto is associated with today.""What we're seeing a lot is companies having digital innovation arms or metaverse innovation arms,"" Flament said. ""They understand that the technology is here. It's not going to go away.""NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, could alter users' relationships with properties in games and events, for example. These are digital assets that track ownership of unique virtual items on the blockchain. ""Digital assets will be an increasing part of our lives, whether that is a collectible, a ticket, value, identity,"" Ian Rogers, chief experience officer at crypto wallet firm Ledger, told CNBC. ""Identity could be membership ... [people] using NFTs they own to get access to a particular event or something like that.""But for many, there's still a learning curve to overcome. ""It's hard creating wallets and storing keys and going through different platforms,"" Cordel Robbin-Coker, CEO of mobile games firm Carry1st, told CNBC at the Slush startup conference in Helsinki, Finland.Robbin-Coker compared Web3 today with the internet in the early 90s. ""It was clunky. You had dial-up, it took four minutes to get on, the original web browsers were not very intuitive,"" he said.""It's really the early adopters that really engage at that stage. But over time, companies build smoother interfaces. And they cut steps out of it."""

Binance.US will acquire the crypto assets and customer deposits of Voyager Digital in a $1.02 billion deal, weeks after a planned FTX-Voyager acquisition failed as a result of FTX's collapse and Sam Bankman-Fried's arrest.Despite the nominal independence, Binance.US operates as a ""de facto subsidiary"" of the international Binance business, according to Reuters.related investing newsCrypto sees fifth consecutive week of outflows, with negative sentiment focused on bitcoinTanaya Macheela day agoVoyager filed for bankruptcy protection in July 2022, after crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) defaulted on a significant loan position extended by Voyager.

2022-12-20,"Core Scientific, one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining companies in the U.S., is filing for bankruptcy.The company still generates positive cash flow, and plans to continue mining while repaying debtholders.The stock is down 98% this year as plunging crypto prices and rising energy prices made mining a much harder business. Core Scientific, one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining companies in the U.S., is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Texas early Wednesday morning, according to a person familiar with the company's finances. The move follows a year of plunging cryptocurrency prices and rising energy prices.Core Scientific mines for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The process involves powering data centers across the country, packed with highly specialized computers that crunch math equations in order to validate transactions and simultaneously create new tokens. The process requires expensive equipment, some technical know-how, and a lot of electricity.Core's market capitalization had fallen to $78 million as of end of trading Tuesday, down from a $4.3 billion valuation in July 2021 when the company went public through a special purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC. The stock has fallen more than 98% in the last year.The company is still generating positive cashflow, but that cash is not sufficient to repay the financing debt owed on equipment it was leasing, according to a person familiar with the company's situation. The company will not liquidate, but will continue to operate normally while reaching a deal with senior security noteholders, which hold the bulk of the company's debt, according to this person, who declined to be named discussing confidential company matters.Core had previously said in a filing in October that holders of its common stock could suffer ""a total loss of their investment,"" but that may not be the case if the overall industry recovers. The deal cut with Core's convertible note holders is structured in such a way that if, in fact, the business environment for bitcoin improves, common equity holders may not get totally wiped out. The company also disclosed that it would not make its debt payments coming due in late Oct. and early Nov. — and said that creditors were free to sue the company for nonpayment. Core, which primarily mints bitcoin, has seen the price of the token drop from an all-time high above $69,000 in Nov. 2021, to around $16,800 That loss in value, paired with greater competition among miners — and increased energy prices — have compressed its profit margins.

The Democratic National Committee and the party's Senate and House campaign arms — the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee — have made similar commitments to return donations from former FTX executives.Bankman-Fried has contributed millions toward other PACs aligned with the Democratic Party, including to the House Majority PAC, Protect Our Future and Future Forward USA. The Bankman-Fried-founded hedge fund, Alameda Research, donated more than $5 million to Future Forward USA, which went on to spend millions backing Joe Biden's 2020 candidacy for president. Those PACs did not respond to requests to comment on whether they would return the contributions.Bankman-Fried also donated $6 million in April to House Majority PAC, which raises money for Democratic candidates running for the lower chamber, according to an FEC filing. The PAC ""will send funds in question wherever authorities instruct us,"" spokesman CJ Warnke said after publication of this story.Bankman-Fried contributed nearly $40 million in the midterms, and most of the money went to Democrats. Singh donated $8 million to federal campaigns during the 2022 midterms. The former FTX director of engineering has not been charged with any crimes.The PAC is returning the donations after Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and is facing charges by U.S. federal prosecutors, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Prosecutors charged Bankman-Fried with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, among other allegations.He was also charged with violating campaign finance laws, including allegations that he gave at least $25,000 to campaigns and political action committees ""in the names of other persons.""Bankman-Fried diverted customer assets held by FTX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, to his separate crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, the SEC said in its complaint. He then used those funds to make ""large political donations,"" to make investments, and buy ""lavish real estate,"" the SEC alleged.

2022-12-21,"The next financial crisis will be caused by private cryptocurrencies, if these assets are allowed to grow, Shaktikanta Das, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, warned Wednesday.Das said his main concern is that cryptocurrencies lack any underlying value, calling them ""speculative"" and adding they should be banned.Das' comments come as the central bank seeks to introduce its own digital version of the Indian rupee. The next financial crisis will be caused by private cryptocurrencies, if these assets are allowed to grow, the head of India's central bank warned on Wednesday.""Cryptocurrencies have… huge inherent risks for our macroeconomic and financial stability,"" Shaktikanta Das, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said at an event. He pointed to the recent collapse of FTX as an example.Das said his main concern is that cryptocurrencies don't have any underlying value, calling them ""speculative"" and adding that he thinks they should be banned.""It [private cryptocurrency trade] is a hundred percent speculative activity, and I would still hold the view that it should be prohibited … because, if it is allowed to grow, if you try to regulate it and allow it to grow, please mark my words, the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies,"" Das said.Private cryptocurrencies refer to digital coins such as bitcoin.Das' comments come as the central bank pushes to introduce its own digital version of the Indian rupee. The Reserve Bank of India began a pilot program for the digital rupee on Dec. 1 for retail use in select cities. Certain users are able to transact using the digital rupee via apps and mobile wallets.The digital rupee is a type of central bank digital currency (CBDC). Many central banks around the world are looking into issuing digital versions of their own currency.Das said CBDCs can expedite international money transfers and reduce the need for logistics, such as printing notes.China's central bank is furthest ahead globally on the development of a CBDC. Beijing has been trialing use of its digital yuan in the real world since late 2020, extending its availability to more users this year.Digital currency regulation was thrust further into the spotlight this year after a $1.3 trillion crash in the value of the cryptocurrency market and the high-profile collapse of the FTX exchange.China has effectively banned cryptocurrency trade.The Indian government is working on cryptocurrency legislation that could prohibit some activity around digital currencies, while creating a legal framework for the central bank's digital currency.Central banks often said cryptocurrencies did not pose a major risk to the economy, when they represented a much smaller asset class. But a growing number of voices warn of the potential macroeconomic impact, particularly if cryptocurrencies go unregulated.Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England's deputy governor for financial stability, said in July that cryptocurrencies may not be ""integrated enough"" into the financial system to be an ""immediate systemic risk."" He noted that he thinks the boundaries between the crypto world and the traditional financial system will ""increasingly become blurred.""The U.S. Treasury Department said in October that ""crypto-asset activities could pose risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system"" and emphasized the need for regulation."
2022-12-21,"I was excited to moderate yesterday's Brookings debate over whether to regulate crypto because, truth be told, I hadn't quite made up my own mind about it. My younger self would surely be pounding the table yes, regulate it, you bozos! Look at all the carnage out there! But my older self is more jaded. Regulating crypto seems to me to be not so much about protecting the little guy as about whether to officially allow crypto into the mainstream financial system. By ""regulating"" it, you're not so much policing it (although on some level you are) as enshrining it. And that to me seems like a very dangerous idea.  After all, the stunning collapse of the crypto industry, which has wiped out $3 trillion of crypto market cap and counting, has had almost zero discernible effect on overall financial stability or the economy. It left the mainstream banking system unaffected, quite unlike the mortgage collapse in '06-07. Let's not forget mortgages were such a sought-after investment at the time--until they blew up--because so many of them were stamped with Fannie or Freddie government backing.  So I am sympathetic to Stephen Cecchetti's arguments for not regulating crypto, which effectively boil down to ""let crypto burn."" He basically thinks if you just enforced the existing rules (from the SEC on securities, from the bank regulators on loans and capital, etc.) the industry--which he posits exists as a form of regulatory arbitrage--would pretty much disappear. But that's where I differ with him somewhat; I do see real-world innovation in some cases, and not just finance by a different name.  How else do you explain, for instance, Strike? Jack Mallers has been a frequent guest on our shows; a big personality, to be sure, but what really intrigues me is his attempt to build a rival, cheaper payments network to Visa (domestically) and Western Union (cross-border) using Bitcoin. If crypto remains in regulatory purgatory, I could understand that that might be a headwind for the adoption of technology like Strike's in the U.S. How do you build a regulatory framework, in other words, that helps advance genuine innovations (if you'd call it that) like Mallers' rather than the personal agenda of Sam Bankman-Fried's now-defunct FTX? Perhaps the best way to do so is to chip away at the worst offenses of crypto, which basically just broke old banking laws under the disguise of new technology, without outlawing altogether real-world experiments with the likes of Bitcoin.  So these are what I'd call the takeaways of our hour-long discussion yesterday that you can watch here:  1) Regulate stablecoins as banks. They need a charter; their securities need to be registered; they have to deal with the cost and hassles of being a bank and the regulatory oversight on capital and so on that comes with that territory.  2) Do not pass any laws or legislation about crypto right now. It's way too early days. As Peter Conti-Brown pointed out, it took us a century or more to write proper legislation governing banks and then securities; we should not rush to have Congress get involved here.  3) Do not create a separate, light-touch ""crypto"" regulator. Instead, force existing agencies to properly enforce existing rules. The SEC in particular does not come out looking great here. It's hard to understand why they didn't move against ""tokens"" like FTT (which fueled the rise and fall of FTX) sooner.  4) Perhaps most obviously, the definition of crypto needs to be spelled out so as to clarify whether it's a security (SEC oversight), a commodity (CFTC), or otherwise.  5) And finally, keep banks away from it! Prevent and/or monitor any connections between crypto and the traditional financial system.  I asked our experts, what about things like offering crypto as a 401(k) investment option, as many platforms were starting to do prior to the collapse? How would ""regulation"" have prevented that, and should it have? But to Steve Cecchetti's point, 401(k) plan sponsors have a fiduciary duty and crypto may well turn out to have violated their ""suitability"" requirements. ""I think we're going to see a lot of lawsuits,"" he said.  So again, many of our existing finance laws may well end up catching up with crypto and rooting out those problematic aspects of it that are just banned practices springing up again under new names. But I agree with Peter Conti-Brown that we need to be careful not to snuff out crypto innovation altogether, and that leaving it entirely unregulated may do so. And I'm not sure, to Hyun Shin's argument, that pushing a central bank digital currency in crypto's place would solve any of these problems.   It will be a very tricky task to clean up crypto in a way that makes the financial system less, and not more, prone to future collapse.  See you at 1 p.m! KellyTwitter: @KellyCNBCInstagram: @realkellyevans"
2022-12-21,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried will fly to New York Wednesday night after a series of chaotic and contentious courtroom hearings in the Bahamas.His attorney, Jerone Roberts, reading from an affidavit signed Dec. 20, told the court that Bankman-Fried was consenting to extradition in part due to a ""desire to make the relevant customers whole.""Bankman-Fried was ""anxious to leave,"" Roberts told the court. Sam Bankman-Fried is flying Wednesday night to New York, according to the office of the attorney general of the Bahamas, where he is later expected to be arraigned in U.S. federal court, concluding a days-long saga.Bankman-Fried, 30, was indicted in New York federal court on Dec. 9 and arrested three days later by Bahamas law enforcement at the request of U.S. prosecutors.His attorney, Jerone Roberts, reading from an affidavit signed Dec. 20, told the court that Bankman-Fried was consenting to extradition in part due to a ""desire to make the relevant customers whole."" Bankman-Fried was ""anxious to leave,"" Roberts told the court.It is unclear how his return would help plug the $8 billion balance sheet hole that, according to federal complaints, came as a result of risky trading and extravagant spending by FTX executives.Bankman-Fried will face arraignment and bail proceedings after he lands. Unlike other white-collar cases, however, Bankman-Fried faces a particular set of challenges.""This is obviously not the typical case,"" former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti told CNBC. ""He is facing decades in prison. And he doesn't have ties to the community in SDNY like a typical defendant would and also has ties to a foreign jurisdiction. So prosecutors have a shot at getting the judge to order detention unless the defendant posts property or a significant cash bond.""Throughout the extradition waiver process, Bankman-Fried's Bahamas legal team and U.S. lawyers have appeared to be at loggerheads. His legal team initially stated that it would fight extradition attempts, but on Saturday a person familiar with the matter told CNBC that the crypto billionaire had changed his mind and would return to the United States.On Monday morning, Bankman-Fried's Bahamas counsel said the former billionaire wouldn't return to the United States without viewing a copy of his indictment, with the lawyer telling a Bahamas magistrate that he was ""shocked"" to even see Bankman-Fried in court.Chaos ensued as reporters and attorneys for Bankman-Fried attempted to pin down whether the former crypto billionaire would be rendered back to the United States for arraignment in federal court.Finally, on Tuesday, a Bahamas prison official and a source familiar with the matter confirmed that Bankman-Fried had signed extradition paperwork and would appear for his final hearing in Nassau on Thursday.When Bankman-Fried lands in New York, the so-far atypical proceedings should take on a more familiar tenor. In a typical federal case, the accused ""would be taken to the detention center for processing before the initial detention hearing/arraignment,"" former CFTC trial attorney & Kennyhertz Perry partner Braden Perry told CNBC.""But again, if arranged in advance with the magistrate in charge of the detention hearing, the court may allow a hearing before processing, but that is unlikely. His attorneys could also waive the detention hearing, at least for now, and request a more detailed evidentiary hearing to ensure their best arguments are made with proper evidence for detention, as it's usually a one-time shot at getting out before trial,"" Perry continued.Bankman-Fried stands accused by federal law enforcement and financial regulators of perpetrating what the SEC called one of the largest and most ""brazen"" frauds in recent memory. Replacement CEO John J. Ray described a ""complete failure of corporate control"" at the company.Federal regulators have alleged that Bankman-Fried used that $8 billion worth of customer assets for extravagant real estate purchases and vanity projects, including stadium naming rights and millions in political donations.CNBC's Kate Rooney contributed to this report."
2022-12-22,"FTX co-founder Gary Wang and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison cut a deal with federal prosecutors for $250,000 bail and travel restrictions as part of their plea deals in FTX's implosion.Ellison and Wang were two of Sam Bankman-Fried's top executives and were intricately involved in executing his multibillion-dollar fraud, according to federal charges and regulatory complaints. Federal prosecutors endorsed plans to allow two former Sam Bankman-Fried lieutenants, Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, to post bail after both pleaded guilty to supporting a multibillion-dollar fraud allegedly perpetrated by former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried, court documents show.Gary Wang was the chief technology officer of FTX. Caroline Ellison was the co-CEO of Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency trading firm.Wang and Ellison would be required to post $250,000 in bail each, surrender their passports and restrict their travel to the continental United States.In return, the pair conceded their role in supporting an $8 billion fraud that left millions of customers without their investments and destabilized the crypto industry.Prosecutors won't object to the bail conditions, but it's unclear whether a judge will approve them.Attorneys for Ellison and Wang did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In an earlier statement, Wang's attorney Ilan Graff, a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, said ""Gary has accepted responsibility for his actions and takes seriously his obligations as a cooperating witness.""In addition to admitting their complicity in the collapse of FTX, Wang and Ellison signed consent orders with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a civil concession that Bankman-Fried has yet to make. Wang and Ellison also both settled separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Wang, 29, and Ellison, 28, both pleaded guilty to fraud charges stemming from their leadership positions at FTX and Alameda, respectively. They signed their deals in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office on Monday.Whether Bankman-Fried, 30, has made a plea deal has not yet been disclosed. In a prerecorded statement Wednesday night, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said the indicted former FTX CEO had been taken into FBI custody after a chaotic Bahamas extradition process.Bankman-Fried will appear before a judge Thursday. FTX's collapse was precipitated when reporting by CoinDesk revealed a highly concentrated position in self-issued FTT coins, which Bankman-Fried's hedge fund Alameda Research used as collateral for billions in crypto loans. Binance, a rival exchange, announced it would sell its stake in FTT, spurring a massive withdrawal in funds. The company froze assets and declared bankruptcy days later. Charges from the SEC and CFTC indicated that FTX had commingled customer funds with Alameda Research and that billions in customer deposits had been lost along the way."
2022-12-22,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried will be released on $250 million bail, a federal judge ruled, while he awaits trial for eight federal criminal charges related to alleged fraud at his collapsed crypto empire.Bankman-Fried was extradited from the Bahamas to Westchester County in New York on Wednesday night after days of chaotic court hearings.Two of his top executives, Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, pleaded guilty Wednesday to various criminal charges related to fraud at FTX, and are cooperating with the federal government. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was released on $250 million bond while awaiting trial for fraud and other criminal charges, a New York federal judge ruled Thursday.Bankman-Fried stepped out of U.S. District Court in Manhattan, flanked by his parents, his legal team, and court security at 2:19 local time.The terms of his personal recognizance bond were agreed to by prosecutors and Bankman-Fried's lawyers. The 30-year-old will face his next hearing, presided over by Judge Ronnie Abrams, in New York City on Jan. 3., where he'll enter his plea and be arraigned.A recognizance bond is a written commitment from the accused to appear in court when ordered. In return, Bankman-Fried's camp would not be required to meet the full collateral requirements of the bail.The bond was secured by equity in his family home, and by the signatures of his parents and two other individuals with ""considerable"" assets. In addition to the $250 million package, which prosecutors called ""the largest-ever pretrial bond,"" the former crypto billionaire would also be required to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, submit to mental health counseling, and restrict himself to travel within and between the Northern District of California and the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.Judge Gabriel Gorenstein said Bankman-Fried would require ""strict"" supervision following his release to his parents' home in California.His parents, both Stanford Law professors, were present in the courtroom. Bankman-Fried was flanked by two U.S. marshals, dressed in a blue suit and brown shoes. Bankman-Fried entered in ankle shackles as well, but traded them for his ankle monitor while in the courtroom.He only spoke when the judge asked him if Bankman-Fried understood the consequences of breaking his bail agreement.""Yes, I do,"" he told the judge.The former FTX CEO will also be barred from opening any new lines of credit of more than $1,000 while awaiting trial over what federal regulators have called a ""brazen"" fraud at his bankrupt crypto empire.Bankman-Fried was the heart of ""a fraud of epic proportions,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos told the court. But he voluntarily returned to the United States, has no history of flight and has significantly reduced financial assets, Roos said.Bankman-Fried had previously claimed that he was down to a mere $100,000, a steep fall from grace for a man who was once at the head of a $32 billion crypto empire. Bankman-Fried stands accused of perpetrating a multibillion-dollar fraud on his investors, using customer funds to purchase properties, fund political donations and backstop trades at his hedge fund Alameda Research.Federal regulators allege over $8 billion in customer funds is missing. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Nov. 11. Bankman-Fried's successor, CEO John Ray, said he'd never seen such a ""complete failure of corporate control.""Two of his top lieutenants, Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, pleaded guilty to related fraud charges and are cooperating with law enforcement. Wang's and Ellison's plea deals were revealed Wednesday.Bankman-Fried was charged by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District with eight counts including securities fraud and money laundering, and was rendered from the Bahamas to New York om Wednesday evening.Bankman-Fried's bail dwarfs other federal white-collar bonds. Bernie Madoff posted a $10 million bond while awaiting trial on his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. Jeff Skilling, former Enron CEO, posted a $5 million bond, while Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos founder, posted a scant $500,000."
2022-12-22,"There could be a lot more to come now that regulators are specifically saying that crypto tokens are securities.  The SEC has been taking a lot of heat for not doing more to get ahead of the FTX debacle. Now, it appears they are dropping the hammer. In a complaint last night, they defined the FTT ""token"" at the heart of that exchange's problems as an ""investment"" with profit potential, or in other words, as CoinDesk reports, as a security.  This should not exactly come as a surprise, since, as Amy Castor reports, the SEC has ""consistently said for many years that basically, crypto tokens are securities under the Howey test."" As the SEC has explained, ""The U.S. Supreme Court's Howey case and subsequent case law have found that an 'investment contract' exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others."" (Emphasis mine.)  Because the FTT token could increase in value, based on usage of the FTX platform, and benefit those holding it, then it's an investment contract, the SEC asserted last night. Which means that it--and any other such crypto tokens (which is to say, most of them)--falls under the SEC's jurisdiction, has to follow securities law, and is subject to SEC enforcement. Again, it would have been nice if all of this enforcement had happened perhaps before the FTX platform collapsed--and it wouldn't necessarily have stopped Sam Bankman-Fried's alleged $8 billion theft of customer money. But tighter enforcement of tokens in the first place could have kept them from mushrooming in size and enabling his brazen actions. Or as former SEC official John Reed Stark warned, ""Clearly, the SEC just blasted a shot across the bow of crypto-exchange tokens. More proof that the SEC crypto-regulatory onslaught...is poised to grow exponentially."" He points to ICOs as a precedent. ""Now the time has come for SEC regulation of exchange-produced tokens, which are the glue that binds the incestuous crypto-ecosystem grift,"" he wrote, adding, ""Hallelujah."" Some see even more dramatic implications; ""If tokens are securities, many, MANY people broke the law,"" warned one pundit on Twitter. ""Entrepreneurs, promoters, and--yikes!--prominent venture capitalists."" Maybe that's a stretch, but kind of like the Federal Reserve doing massive rate hikes to correct its previous overstimulus, it wouldn't be surprising to see the SEC get extremely tough on crypto now to make up for being too lax before many of these exchanges collapsed.  And now, if crypto exists as pure regulatory arbitrage, as some have argued, this kind of enforcement should quickly reveal whether it can survive once it has to actually play by the rules. If it can't, there's our answer. If it can survive, hopefully it's the truly innovative aspects of crypto that can reveal themselves and prove this industry deserves to have a real future.See you at 1 p.m! Kelly P.S.

2022-12-23,"From Tim Draper to top crypto bosses, the market was awash with pundits predicting new record highs for bitcoin in 2022.Other market players were less positive, and some correctly called bitcoin sinking below the $20,000 mark, even as low as $10,000.But the failure of stablecoin terraUSD, liquidity issues across the crypto industry and the dramatic collapse of the FTX exchange, shocked investors and sent ripples through the market. 2022 marked the start of a new ""crypto winter,"" with high-profile companies collapsing across the board and prices of digital currencies crashing spectacularly. The events of the year took many investors by surprise and made the task of predicting bitcoin's price that much harder.The crypto market was awash with pundits making feverish calls about where bitcoin was heading next. They were often positive, though a few correctly forecast the cryptocurrency sinking below $20,000 a coin.related investing newsCrypto sees fifth consecutive week of outflows, with negative sentiment focused on bitcoinTanaya Macheel22 hours agoBut many market watchers were caught off guard in what has been a tumultuous year for crypto, with high-profile company and project failures sending shock waves across the industry.It began in May with the collapse of terraUSD, or UST, an algorithmic stablecoin that was supposed to be pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. Its failure brought down terraUSD's sister token luna and hit companies with exposure to both cryptocurrencies. Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund with bullish views on crypto, plunged into liquidation and filed for bankruptcy because of its exposure to terraUSD.Then came the November collapse of FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges which was run by Sam Bankman-Fried, an executive who was often in the spotlight. The fallout from FTX continues to ripple across the cryptocurrency industry.On top of crypto-specific failures, investors have also had to contend with rising interest rates, which have put pressure on risk assets, including stocks and crypto.Bitcoin has sunk around 75% since reaching its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021 and more than $2 trillion has been wiped off the value of the entire cryptocurrency market. On Friday, bitcoin was trading at just under $17,000. Loading chart... CNBC reached out to the people behind some of the boldest price calls on bitcoin in 2022, asking them how they got it wrong and whether the year's events have changed their outlook for the world's largest digital currency.  In 2018, at a tech conference in Amsterdam, Tim Draper predicted bitcoin reaching $250,000 a coin by the end of 2022. The famed Silicon Valley investor wore a purple tie with bitcoin logos, and even performed a rap about the digital currency onstage. Four years later, it's looking pretty unlikely Draper's call will materialize. When asked about his $250,000 target earlier this month, the Draper Associates founder told CNBC $250,000 ""is still my number"" — but he's extending his prediction by six months. ""I expect a flight to quality and decentralized crypto like bitcoin, and for some of the weaker coins to become relics,"" he told CNBC via email.Bitcoin would need to rally nearly 1,400% from its current price of just under $17,000 for Draper's prediction to come true. His rationale is that despite the liquidation of notable players in the market like FTX, there's still a huge untapped demographic for bitcoin: women.""My assumption is that, since women control 80% of retail spending and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women, the dam is about to break,"" Draper said. In April, Antoni Trenchev, the CEO of crypto lender Nexo, told CNBC he thought the world's biggest cryptocurrency could surge above $100,000 ""within 12 months."" Though he still has four months to go, Trenchev acknowledges it is improbable that bitcoin will rally that high anytime soon. Bitcoin ""was on a very positive path"" with institutional adoption growing, Trenchev says, but ""a few major forces interfered,"" including an accumulation of debt, borrowing without collateral or against low-quality collateral, and fraudulent activity.  Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProHedge funds piled into these A.I. stocks during the first quarterWatch Elon Musk's full interview with CNBC's David Faber on Twitter, Tesla and A.I. advancesBank of America says buy these five tech stocks before it's too late Hedge funds piled into these A.I. stocks during the first quarterWatch Elon Musk's full interview with CNBC's David Faber on Twitter, Tesla and A.I. advancesBank of America says buy these five tech stocks before it's too late ""I am pleasantly surprised by the stability of crypto prices, but I do not think we are out of the woods yet and that the second and third-order effects are still to play out, so I am somewhat skeptical as to a V-shape recovery,"" Trenchev said. The entrepreneur says he's also done making bitcoin price predictions. ""My advice to everyone, however, remains unchanged,"" he added. ""Get a single digit percentage point of your investable assets in bitcoin and do not look at it for 5-10 years. Thank me later.""  On Jan. 12, Guido Buehler, the former CEO of regulated Swiss bank Seba, which is focused on cryptocurrencies, said his company had an ""internal valuation model"" of between $50,000 and $75,000 for bitcoin in 2022.Buehler's reasoning was that institutional investors would help drive the price higher. At the time, bitcoin was trading at between $42,000 and $45,000. Bitcoin never reached $50,000 in 2022.The executive, who now runs his own advisory and investment firm, said 2022 has been an ""annus horribilis,"" in response to CNBC questions about what went wrong with the call.""The war in Ukraine in February triggered a shock to the paradigm of world order and the financial markets,"" Buehler said, citing the consequences of raised market volatility and rising inflation in light of the disruption of commodities like oil.Another major factor was ""the realization that interest rates are still the driver of most asset classes,"" including crypto, which ""was hard blow for the crypto community, where there has been the belief that this asset class is not correlated to traditional assets.""Buehler said lack of risk management in the crypto industry, missing regulation and fraud have also been major factors affecting prices.The executive remains bullish on bitcoin, however, saying it will reach $75,000 ""sometime in the future,"" but that it is ""all a matter of timing.""""I believe that BTC has proven its robustness throughout all the crisis since 2008 and will continue to do so."" Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Bitfinex and Tether, told CNBC in April that he expected bitcoin to fall sharply below $40,000 but end the year ""well above"" $50,000.""I'm a bullish person on bitcoin … I see so much happening in this industry and so many countries interested in bitcoin adoption that I'm really positive,"" he said at the time. On the day of the interview, bitcoin was trading above $41,000. The first part of Ardoino's call was correct — bitcoin did fall well below $40,000. But it never recovered.In a follow-up email this month, Ardoino said he believes in bitcoin's resilience and the blockchain technology underlying it.""As mentioned, predictions are hard to make. No one could have predicted or foreseen the number of companies, well regarded by the global community, failing in such a spectacular fashion,"" he told CNBC.""Some legitimate concerns and questions remain around the future of crypto. It might be a volatile industry, but the technologies developed behind it are incredible."" A key theme in 2022 has been bitcoin's correlation to U.S. stock indexes, especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. In June, Deutsche Bank analysts published a note that said bitcoin could end the year with a price of approximately $27,000. At the time of the note, bitcoin was trading at just over $20,000.It was based on the belief from Deutsche Bank's equity analysts that the S&P 500 would jump to $4,750 by year-end.But that call is unlikely to materialize. Marion Laboure, one of the authors of Deutsche Bank's initial report on crypto in June, said the bank now expects bitcoin to end the year around $21,000.""High inflation, monetary tightening, and slow economic growth have likely put additional downward pressure on the crypto ecosystem,"" Laboure told CNBC, adding that more traditional assets such as bonds may begin to look more attractive to investors than bitcoin.Laboure also said high-profile collapses continue to hit sentiment.""Every time a major player in the crypto industry fails, the ecosystem suffers a confidence crisis,"" she said.""In addition to the lack of regulation, crypto's biggest hurdles are transparency, conflicts of interest, liquidity, and the lack of reliable available data. The FTX collapse is a reminder that these problems continue to be unresolved."" In a Nov. 9 research note, JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team predicted the price of bitcoin would slump to $13,000 ""in the coming weeks."" They had the benefit of hindsight after the FTX liquidity crisis, which they said would cause a ""new phase of crypto deleveraging,"" putting downside pressure on prices.The cost it takes miners to produce new bitcoins historically acts as a ""floor"" for bitcoin's price and is likely to revisit a $13,000 low as seen over the summer months, the analysts said. That's not as far off bitcoin's current price as some other predictions, but it's still much lower than Friday's price of just under $17,000.A JPMorgan spokesperson said Panigirtzoglou ""isn't available to comment further"" on his research team's forecast. Ian Harnett, co-founder and chief investment officer at macro research firm Absolute Strategy Research, warned in June that the world's top digital currency was likely to tank as low as $13,000.Explaining his bearish call at the time, Harnett said that, in crypto rallies past, bitcoin had subsequently tended to fall roughly 80% from all-time highs. In 2018, for instance, the token plummeted close to $3,000 after hitting a peak of nearly $20,000 in late 2017.Harnett's target is closer than most, but bitcoin would need to fall another 22% for it to reach that level. When asked about how he felt about the call today, Harnett said he is ""very happy to suggest that we are still in the process of the bitcoin bubble deflating"" and that a drop close to $13,000 is still on the cards.""Bubbles usually see an 80% reversal,"" he said in response to emailed questions.With the U.S. Federal Reserve likely set to raise interest rates further next year, an extended drop below $13,000 to $12,000 or even $10,000 next can't be ruled out, according to Harnett.""Sadly, there is no intrinsic valuation model for this asset — indeed, there is no agreement whether it is a commodity or a currency — which means that there is every possibility that this could trade lower if we see tight liquidity conditions and/or a failure of other digital entities / exchanges,"" he said. Veteran investor Mark Mobius has probably been one of the more accurate predictors of bitcoin.In May, when the price of bitcoin was above $28,000, he told Financial News that bitcoin would likely fall to $20,000, then bounce, but ultimately move down to $10,000.Bitcoin did fall below $20,000 in June, and then bounce in August before falling again through the rest of the year.However, the $10,000 mark was not reached.Mobius told CNBC he forecasts bitcoin to hit $10,000 in 2023. In December 2021, a month on from bitcoin's all-time high, Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, said she expected bitcoin to drop down to $10,000 ""or even more"" in 2022.Bitcoin at the time had fallen about 30% from its near $69,000 record. Still, many crypto talking heads at the time were predicting further gains. Alexander was one of the rare voices going against the tide. ""If I were an investor now I would think about coming out of bitcoin soon because its price will probably crash next year,"" she said at the time. Her bearish call rested on the idea that bitcoin has little intrinsic value and is mostly used for ""speculation.""Bitcoin didn't quite slump as low as $10,000 — but Alexander is feeling good about her prediction. ""Compared with others' predictions, mine was by far the closest,"" she said in emailed comments to CNBC."

2022-12-27,"The 117th Congress is set to finish the year with its most ambitious proposals targeting tech on antitrust and privacy tabled.With a split legislature next year, bipartisanship will be key to passing major reforms.While antitrust proposals may be harder to advance, policy watchers expect a continued focus on digital privacy and creating a framework for cryptocurrency regulation. After what started as a hopeful year for tech policy, the 117th Congress is about to close out its term with many key efforts tabled.Despite bipartisan support for antitrust reform targeting digital tech giants, a digital privacy framework and new guardrails for kids on the internet, lawmakers headed home without passing the hallmark bills of those issues. And the Senate has yet to vote to confirm the final nominee to fill out the Federal Communications Commission, leaving that agency incomplete for the entirety of the Biden administration so far.Congress did pass the CHIPS and Science Act, which incentivizes domestic semiconductor manufacturing after shortages highlighted the risks of overseas production. It also included in the year-end spending package a bill that will raise funds for the antitrust agencies by raising merger filing fees on large deals, as well as a measure banning TikTok on government devices in light of national security concerns due to its ownership by a Chinese company.And even when it comes to many of the bills that remain in limbo, progress this year shows significant headway. That's the case with privacy legislation, where a bill proposed this year gained bipartisan support, passing out of a House committee with a near-unanimous vote. Still, it lacks the backing of the Senate Commerce Committee's Democratic chair, Maria Cantwell of Washington, which is seen as critical to passing the legislation.""Any privacy legislation has to be bipartisan,"" said Craig Albright, vice president of U.S. government relations for enterprise software industry group BSA. ""Senator Cantwell has to be part of the process. There's no going around her, she will be one of the key leaders. But I think if the House can demonstrate continued progress, I think that that will create more of an environment for the Senate to be able to act.""Albright added that the House committee leaders who championed the bill, Energy and Commerce Chair Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and Ranking Member Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., expected to become chair next year under Republican House control, proved with the panel vote ""that substantively, you can come up with a bill that has broad bipartisan support.""""I think that puts this next Congress in a stronger starting position than we've had before,"" Albright said.Lawmakers face a tougher landscape next year if they hope to pick up where they left off on tech reform. With Democratic control of the Senate and Republican control of the House in 2023, policy watchers stress that bipartisanship will be essential to make bills into law.While that might dash hopes for most antitrust reforms, which though bipartisan are not generally supported by Republicans expected to lead the House and key committees, it could mean there's still a chance for legislation on digital privacy, where both parties have stressed urgency despite years of failing to compromise on areas of disagreement.Still, lawmakers who led aggressive antitrust proposals and other tech reforms have signaled they'll continue to fight for those measures next year.""This is clearly the beginning of this fight and not the end,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., whose bill barring online platforms from favoring their own services on their marketplaces failed to make it into year-end must-pass bills, said in a statement following the release of the spending package text. ""I will continue to work across the aisle to protect consumers and strengthen competition.""Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in a statement that while their Kids Online Safety Act, setting new guardrails for sites likely to be accessed by kids, and Open App Markets Act, imposing new regulations on app stores run by Apple and Google, did not make it into the spending bill, they are ""resolved to reintroduce and pass this legislation in the next Congress."" The pair blamed the bills' failure to advance on intense lobbying efforts by the tech industry against them.A survey of congressional staffers by Punchbowl News found that while a majority of Capitol Hill respondents expect a less productive session in terms of passing meaningful legislation, the tech agenda is high up on the expected list of priorities. Punchbowl said that 56% of respondents anticipated action on bills targeting Big Tech, a percentage that was second only to those who expect to see action targeting inflation.Tech regulation is Democrats' top priority, according to Punchbowl, with 59% of respondents choosing it as one of their chief issues. Among lobbyists and business executives surveyed by Punchbowl, 55% predicted lawmakers could crack down on a major tech company, with TikTok coming out as the most likely target, followed by Facebook parent Meta.And while it's unlikely to result in new laws, House Republicans have signaled they'll use their majority to focus on tech issues that have taken a backseat while Democrats held the gavels in both chambers. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who's expected to lead the House Judiciary Committee, signaled he'll likely use that power to focus on tech companies' relationships with Democratic politicians and allegations of bias and censorship by social media platforms.Earlier this month he wrote to the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, demanding information about what he called ""the nature and extent of your companies' collusion with the Biden Administration."" He said the letters should serve as a formal request to preserve records related to the request.Lawmakers are also likely to spend more time looking at crypto regulation, after the downfall of exchange FTX alleged fraud of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried thrust the industry into the limelight before Congress. Legislators have already considered some legislation targeting the industry, and incoming House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., has indicated that making a clearer regulatory framework for crypto is a priority.One of the key questions lawmakers have wrestled with is who should be the agency in charge of overseeing the industry. That question has so far gone unanswered, with many industry players advocating for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission while some consumer advocates preferring the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is larger and better resourced. One prominent bipartisan bill in the Senate would put the CFTC in charge.Just like in 2022, next year's tech policy agenda will be subject to the whims of Congress, and could be especially susceptible if the country sees some level of economic downturn as many experts expect.""Everybody has their desire to regulate tech. But I can't help but wonder what that desire looks like, depending on the economic outlook of the United States in Q1 of 2023,"" said James Czerniawski, senior policy analyst for technology and innovation at the Koch-backed advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, pointing to high interest rates and job cuts in the tech sector. ""If we were to go and enter into a recession at some point in early next year, which isn't out of the realm of possibility, that might go and rejigger priorities from Congress to more immediate things.""Czerniawski said the push for regulation in tech seems to be based on an ""assumption that tech is this thing that's just immovable and going to be around for the test of time with these companies' names attached to it. And, if anything, I think that the past year and change has shown that that's not necessarily true.""""I think that it's pretty easy to beat up on Big Tech when they're so successful and they're pulling in record profits,"" said Tom Romanoff, director of the technology project at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, which has received funding Amazon and Meta, according to recent donor disclosures. ""It becomes a different equation when constituents and districts are upset because they got laid off in one of these very high paying jobs. And so I think if there is an economic downturn, the focus will shift to the economy.""Romanoff added that certain global dynamics could also shift the focus away from increased tech regulation, such as if tensions escalate between China and Taiwan, where a large portion of semiconductors are currently produced. He said an event like that could cause a shift from an ""internal focus of what these large companies mean for U.S. democracy, to kind of a national defense strategy — what does it mean in wartime to regulate an industry that is very much critical to any wartime industry.""Still, Albright of BSA sees focus on the tech sector in Congress remaining high as concerns that have existed in the past are not going away.""I think the economy will go up and down,"" he said. ""But the importance of tech policy issues will still be strong.""Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.WATCH: Crypto is here. Are you ready?"

Meanwhile, the 2-year Treasury yield rose 7 basis points to 4.391%.Yields and prices have an inverted relationship. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%. The move in bond yields put pressure on growth stocks, dragging down technology shares and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which fell almost 1.4%. The Fed has been hiking interest rates in 2022 in an effort to fight persistently high inflation. The central bank increased rates by a further 50 basis points earlier this month after implementing 75 basis point rate hikes at each of its previous four meetings.Concerns about these rate hikes dragging the U.S. economy into a recession have spread among investors in recent weeks as Wall Street awaits a new trading year.

2022-12-27,"Here are the most important news items that investors need to start their trading day: Investors are holding out hope for a rally to end 2022, even though stocks are headed for a down December and their worst year since 2008. News that China effectively ended its zero Covid policy (more on that below) boosted global markets and added some pep to U.S. equities futures early Tuesday. Still, we could be in store for some volatility this week as trading volumes are expected to be low due to this being the week between Christmas and New Year's. Read live markets updates here. The Chinese government is, for all intents and purposes, putting an end to its zero Covid policy. Come Jan. 8, travelers arriving on China's mainland will no longer have to quarantine. On that same date, Chinese officials also plan to stop tracking close Covid contacts, halt risk areas designations and end measures that hamstrung imports. Chinese citizens will also soon be able to travel overseas, officials said. While these swift changes have lifted optimism in markets, including the oil trade, China finds itself contending with a jump in infections that's straining the country's health system. The winter storm that assaulted much of the country has left dozens dead, including at least 27 in Buffalo region of western New York. Weather authorities expected the snow to continue through much of Tuesday in Erie County, New York. While Buffalo and its surrounding area are used to rough wintry conditions, officials called this blizzard, with its four-plus feet of snow and arctic temperatures, ""generational"" and ""one for the ages."" The storm came as many Americans set out to travel for the Christmas weekend, but the weather prompted the cancellation of several thousand flights (more on that below) and left many stuck without power. The U.S. Department of Transportation said it would look into Southwest Airlines' large rate of flight cancellations as the country contends with the aftermath of a large, deadly blizzard. Southwest canceled 70% of its flights Monday and warned it was on pace to operate only a third of its schedule for several more days as it works to fix things. Southwest's problems came as other airlines started to stabilize. ""USDOT is concerned by Southwest Airlines' disproportionate and unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays as well as the failure to properly support customers experiencing a cancellation or delay,"" the Transportation Department said late Monday. North Dimension, one of dozens of obscure firms within Sam Bankman-Fried's collapsed crypto empire, is drawing more attention than it was probably intended to. According to an SEC filing last week, investors looking to trade on FTX were told to wire money to North Dimension in an alleged attempt to hide from customers that the money was actually going to an account controlled by Alameda Research, FTX's sister firm. There's more to it, though, and it's weird. According to an NBC News investigation, North Dimension also had a now-defunct and possibly phony website that purported to sell electronics.

On Nov. 30, the firm slashed 1,100 jobs, or 30% of its workforce. Digital currency exchange Kraken will close down its operations in Japan next month, in another sign of consolidation in the battered crypto industry.In a blogpost on Wednesday, Kraken said it would cease crypto trading services through its Japanese subsidiary, Payward Asia, and deregister from Japan's Financial Services Agency on Jan. 31, 2023.It is the second time Kraken has left the Japanese market. The first was in 2018, when it closed four years after initially establishing operations in 2014. It relaunched in the country in 2020 after securing registration from the regulator.Kraken said the move was ""part of Kraken's efforts to prioritize resources and investments in those areas that align with our strategy and will best position Kraken for long term success.""It cited a combination of ""current market conditions in Japan"" and a ""weak crypto market globally"" as the reasons behind its decision. Japanese customers will have until Jan. 31 to withdraw their fiat and crypto holdings from the Kraken platform, the company said. They'll have the option to either withdraw their crypto to an external wallet or cash out and transfer Japanese yen to a domestic bank account.From Jan. 9, users in Japan will no longer be able to deposit funds into their account, though trading functionality will remain in place so that they can convert their balance to the asset of their choice.Kraken is one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, processing $408.9 million of trading volumes per day, according to CoinMarketCap data.Along with numerous other major industry players, it has been deep in cost-cutting mode lately. On Nov. 30, the firm slashed 1,100 jobs, or 30% of its workforce, a move it said was needed to ""adapt to current market conditions.""Crypto has been plagued by all manner of scandals this year, which has been termed the industry's ""annus horribilis.""The pain started with the demise of Terra, a once $60 billion stablecoin operator, and was followed by the toppling of several other dominos with exposure to the project, including the crypto lender Celsius and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.Crypto exchange FTX's slide into bankruptcy is the most notable industry failure so far. Its controversial co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been released on bail while awaiting trial for fraud and other criminal charges.Prices of bitcoin and other digital currencies have slid as investors soured on the market and as climbing interest rates have put downward pressure on speculative assets such as tech stocks. Bitcoin, the world's biggest token, is down over 60% so far this year."
2022-12-28,"FTX and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried made two $100 million venture investments using customer funds through an FTX subsidiary, the SEC said in a pair of complaints.The only disclosed $100 million investments by FTX Ventures were in Mysten Labs and fintech company Dave.The deals raise questions about potential clawbacks or conveyance issues for FTX bankruptcy attorneys and for individual clients. Of the billions of dollars in customer deposits that disappeared from FTX in a flash, $200 million was used to fund investments in two companies, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged founder Sam Bankman-Fried with ""orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors.""Through its FTX Ventures unit, the crypto firm in March invested $100 million in Dave, a fintech company that had gone public two months earlier through a special purpose acquisition company. At the time, the companies said they would ""work together to expand the digital assets ecosystem.""The other deal the SEC appears to have referenced was a $100 million investment round in September for Mysten Labs, a Web3 company. In total, it was a $300 million funding round that valued Mysten at $2 billion and included participation from Coinbase Ventures, Binance Labs and Andreessen Horowitz's crypto fund. While FTX Ventures has done dozens of transactions, according to PitchBook, the Mysten Labs and Dave investments were the only two disclosed investments of $100 million, based on documents published by the Financial Times, which broke down how the company put $5.2 billion to work. FTX Ventures was described as a $2 billion venture fund, in its press release with Dave.Bankman-Fried, 30, stands accused of committing widespread fraud after FTX, which was valued by private investors at $32 billion earlier this year, sank into bankruptcy in November. A central theme in the charges is how Bankman-Fried diverted funds from FTX to his hedge fund, Alameda Research, which then used that money for risky trades and loans. FTX Ventures was allegedly part of that scheme.Neither Mysten nor Dave have been linked to any alleged wrongdoing within Bankman-Fried's empire. But the investments appear to be the first identified examples of customer money being used by FTX and Bankman-Fried for venture funding. As investigators and FTX lawyers attempt to retrace the outflow of FTX funds, these identified investments and others in the $5 billion venture pool will attract heavy scrutiny.In explicitly linking the two $100 million investments to customer money, the SEC has raised the possibility that they'll be prospects for clawbacks. If FTX bankruptcy trustees can establish that client money funded Bankman-Fried's investments, they could pursue recovery of those funds as part of an effort to retrieve customer assets.A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment.Dave CEO Jason Wilk told CNBC that FTX's investment in Dave is already scheduled to be repaid, with interest, by 2026. FTX's $100 million investment was through a convertible note, a short-term loan of cash that FTX could convert into shares at a later date. That conversion was never made, leaving Dave with a $101.6 million liability, including interest, to FTX and any successor companies, according to the company's most recent SEC filings. ""The note issued to FTX is due for repayment in March 2026,"" the company said in a statement. ""No terms contained in the note trigger any current obligation by Dave to repay prior to the maturity date.""Wilk added that, ""it is important to state we had no knowledge of FTX or Alameda using customer assets to make investments.""Bankman-Fried's investment in Mysten Labs was an equity deal. Because Mysten is a privately held company, there's no clearly defined process in U.S. bankruptcy code for clawing back those funds.Mysten declined to comment. Lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, which represents FTX, did not respond to requests for comment.An SEC complaint filed against two of Bankman-Fried's lieutenants, Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, specified that ""two $100 million investments made by FTX's affiliated investment vehicle, FTX Ventures Ltd., were funded with FTX customer funds that had been diverted to Alameda.""Irrespective of what money was being used, FTX's investments were ill-timed.Dave shares have plummeted over 97% since the company went public, mirroring the performance of the broader basket of SPACs. In July, the Nasdaq warned Dave that if its share price didn't improve, it was at risk of being delisted. The stock currently trades for 28 cents and the market cap sits at around $100 million.Alameda Research had previously made a $15 million investment in Dave in August 2021, before the Nasdaq listing. Dave was founded in 2016 and offers customers a free cash advance on their future income as part of a suite of banking products. Mark Cuban led a $3 million seed round in 2017.The investment could have been lucrative for FTX if Dave's share price had improved beyond $10 a share, allowing FTX to convert at a profit.FTX's investment in Mysten came in the midst of a crypto meltdown. Bitcoin and ether were down by more than half for the year and numerous hedge funds and lenders had gone bankrupt.The funds were to be used in Mysten's effort to ""build a blockchain that scales with demand and incentivizes growth,"" Mysten CEO Evan Cheng said at the time.Representatives for Ellison and Wang did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment.Ellison, 28, and Wang, 29, pleaded guilty in New York last week to federal charges over the illicit use of customer funds for trading and venture investments, allegedly directed by Bankman-Fried. Both are cooperating with federal investigations into Bankman-Fried and the collapse of FTX.WATCH: The terms of the $250 million bail agreement for FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried"
2022-12-28,"It's one thing when Tesla's stock keeps tanking. Elon Musk, the inventory glut, EV demand faltering, blah, blah, blah. But Apple? The most successful company of the 21st century? Its shares slid to a new 52-week low again this morning, around $127. That's a 30% drop from the highs this year. The company is now worth barely over $2 trillion, down from $3 trillion at its January peak. So that's a trillion dollars of Apple wealth that has vanished this year. Tesla? Nearly another trillion. In fact, if you include Tesla with the rest of ""big tech,"" (Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta) that's a loss of nearly $5 trillion in value, just this year. A mind-boggling sum. It's amazing there haven't been more blow-ups as a result. And that's not all! The S&P 500 as a whole has lost $8 trillion, and the rest of the smaller publicly traded U.S. stocks another $2 trillion, according to analyst Howard Silverblatt and our own Robert Hum. Oh, and let's not forget crypto! A year ago, the asset class (if you want to call it that) was worth more than $3 trillion. Today, it's just over $806 billion. So between the stock market and crypto, we've lost more than $12 trillion of wealth in about twelve months' time. Wow. So if you're feeling poorer this year, you're not alone. The easy money days of the pandemic, when ""stocks never go down"" and ""apes"" were fueling niche stocks to new highs and everyone felt like a genius...those days are long gone. Everyone is kicking themselves for not selling at the highs. It's not just you. This is just what happens when the government and the central bank inject $10 trillion of stimulus to help the economy through the pandemic, and then have to basically suck it back out after realizing that it was way, way too much. It wasn't just asset prices; the entire economy swelled in size. Nominal GDP soared by 10% last year! The price of everything reset higher. How could it not have with a tidal wave like that behind it? Now, the script is playing in reverse. Price inflation in goods is also receding from its highs as the Fed tightens. The economy is slowing substantially. The money supply, which soared when the Fed expanded its balance sheet, has now shrunk by nearly 2% since the spring, an almost-unheard-of kind of decline. This will likely be the first annual drop in at least sixty years. The real question now for each data point—whether home prices, car prices, Apple's share price, the S&P 500—is, does it have to reset all the way back to pre-pandemic levels? For lumber, the answer is yes. If semiconductors go the same way, as I wrote about last October (""Are semis about to get lumbered?"") then the SMH ETF, down almost 40% from its peak, still has another 25% to drop. As for Apple, it was trading around $80 pre-pandemic, versus $128 today. As for Tesla, it was around $60 pre-pandemic, versus $106 today. Ironically for Tesla, that's the same level our super-bearish trader warned us yesterday was the next real resistance level for the stock after it has had its worst month ever, down 45% and crashing through every other resistance spot on its way down. The S&P 500 more broadly, if you're wondering, is still about 500 points, or 13%, above its February 2020 levels.  I can really only see two ways out of this horror-movie-style reversal. One, a Fed pivot that stops the liquidity drain. Or, two, a spate of better-than-expected corporate earnings next season that prove the market can stand on its own two legs without Fed support at justifiably higher levels. In the meantime, it's all making for a pretty ugly finish to what's been a very ugly year.  See you at 1 p.m! Kelly Twitter: @KellyCNBCInstagram: @realkellyevans"
